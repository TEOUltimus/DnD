<p class="size2">One of the core concepts of any reality is the 
juxtaposition of the mortal and immortal, the living and the dead, and 
the base and the divine. Societies within that reality conceive of 
themselves in relation to others -- the world, other individuals and 
societies around them, and what may or may not exist beyond the world 
around them. Are they alone or unique in the universe? Have they made 
themselves out of nothing? Is there a transcendent referent toward which
 they may aspire, or is this all there is? In short, a world must have 
some idea about whether and in what form religion and faith will exist. 
The standard <b>D&amp;D</b> model is a sort of bland, tolerant 
pantheism, where you find gods for almost every taste and specialty, and
 where everyone gets along tolerably well as long as alignments are not 
too opposed. Even if alignments are opposed, everyone stays out of the 
other side's way or doesn't cause trouble. In creating or implementing a
 world, however, a DM should decide whether that default assumption will
 hold true in his or her world. If you as a DM decide to try something 
different in this area, what follows might serve as a helpful guide in 
thinking about what that might look like.</p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2008-24%20-%20Keepin%27%20the%20Faith_files/Nerull_symbol.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="212" width="200">It is possible, though difficult, to <b>create a world where there is no faith and religion, </b>where
 atheism rules the day, and where no one seriously accepts the idea of 
all-powerful (or even just super-powerful) transcendent beings. This 
creates a certain difficulty in the face of tangible manifestations of 
what is termed divine power -- priestly spells being the most obvious 
example. Such a world might also have a curious feel, since it would be 
very different from the world wherein most <i>players</i> reside. 
Whether players themselves endorse religious views is immaterial; the 
point is that they are aware that a great many people in their world do.
 To imagine a world where no one did might be jarring.</p>
<p class="size2">What would clerics and their ilk do in such a world? If they have no faith in deities, then <b>where does their power come from?</b>
 Perhaps native spirits that dwell in all things, living and dead, hold 
the secrets of divine power. Perhaps through communion with and 
understanding of these spirits, a divine caster can cause his or her 
will to be made manifest in a flare of divine power. Another answer 
involves the existence of a pool of divine power that equates to arcane 
magic in many ways, but that has certain unique characteristics that 
allow it to more efficiently do certain things (such as healing and 
protection). Those with the requisite skill and will could access it, 
though it might require a different mindset than arcane magery. Where 
arcane magic might involve attempting to figure out the intricate 
patterns of matter and energy that make up the world and then deftly 
manipulating the energy to create supernatural effects, perhaps divine 
magic might instead involve opening oneself wholly to what is there and 
imagining the change one wishes, then compelling it to be by sheer force
 of will empowered by the divine energies the wielder has channeled. 
Perhaps devotion and belief are required, but not invested in 
personified deities but rather within particular philosophies or 
mindsets or forces of the universe.<a href="#1">[1]</a> The divine caster's absolute devotion and engagement with those forces or ideals could form the basis of his or her power.</p>
<p class="size2">Paladins are perhaps a useful illustration of this 
idea. Some could argue that paladins do not and need not follow any 
particular faith or creed in the sense of a religion <i>per se</i>. 
Instead, their supernatural and extraordinary abilities flow from their 
openness and total devotion to the ideals of law and goodness. Their 
willingness to fill themselves to the brim from the cup of lawful and 
good ideals and their absolute and unshakable confidence that what they 
are doing is right and true allow them to do things that others simply 
cannot. This isn't the way that everyone would run paladins as a feature
 of their campaign worlds, but it demonstrates the concept of how total 
devotion to a <i>cause</i> rather than an individual deity can become a plausible source for divine power.</p>

<p class="size2">If we leave behind a world of total atheism, we can 
look at other possible cosmological ideas for how your game world works,
 and you can <b>draw inspiration from the abundant body of fantasy literature.</b>
 Robert E. Howard's Conan and Kull books include established religions 
in civilized and barbarian lands that are usually organized only in 
certain areas (and usually to some nefarious end). The priests who lead 
these cults, however, are often mere figureheads or charlatans, and 
manifestation of any real divine power is very rare and indirect. It 
tends to take the form of a sudden bit of good or bad luck that might or
 might not really be an act of the gods. Some of the "gods" encountered 
are simply monsters of some sort or creations of evil sorcerers. In such
 a world, the "priests" would be mostly experts rather than 
spellcasters. Any priests who <i>can</i> cast spells would be bards 
using their knowledge of ancient lore and minor magical talents to 
enrapture and convince the gullible sheep of their flock, or they could 
be adepts. A scant few would be sorcerers or wizards, plus perhaps the 
occasional druid or true cleric. The latter would probably be a lone 
prophet or a mystical hermit who the establishment considers dangerous 
or who is perhaps legendary for his or her healing powers. In any event,
 these latter folk would clearly be the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p class="size2">Worlds like those found in Robert Jordan's <i>Wheel of Time</i> series or Stephen R. Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series do not have whole pantheons of deities, but rather <b>an opposed dualistic pair.</b>
 In both cases, the Creator has created the world and the pattern of 
reality, and the Dark One (Lord Foul in Donaldson's books) spends all of
 his time trying to break it. The manifestation of divine power is rare 
in the direct sense but fairly common in the indirect sense. The Dark 
One's machinations are more apparent because they are active; the 
Creator's efforts are implicit in the conservation of the existing 
reality and thus rarely show up in any tangible way other than as 
constraint upon or negation of the Dark One's efforts. Power-wielders 
fight on behalf of the Creator and the Dark One, but their power is 
mostly derived from a power source that is seemingly independent of 
either (though it was created by the Creator and corrupted by the Dark 
One).</p>
<p class="size2">Three basic belief options are available to residents 
of those worlds: the Creator is the good guy, and the Dark One and his 
minions need to be suppressed to avoid destroying the world; the Dark 
One is the good guy, and the Creator is a negligent slumlord who is 
keeping us all down, and things will be better when we can overthrow him
 and be free; the Dark One and the Creator are just vague abstractions 
out there and have no real bearing on our lives, so whether you choose 
to believe in either of them or not is mostly a matter of private and 
personal opinion. You can add flavors of each position (for example, the
 Children of the Light in Jordan's series, who believe that all magic is
 inherently evil). In general, however, neither world offers much in the
 way of organized religion; what belief does exist consists mostly of 
folkways, traditions, sayings, and superstitions, and each "side" is 
defined more by its opposition to the other than by its own theology. 
The conflict could be stated more precisely as the forces arrayed for 
and against the Dark One's side, since the ostensible agents of good 
rarely if ever claim to be working on behalf of the Creator; that is 
more of an incidental fact of their efforts to thwart the Creator's 
enemy. The relationship between the divinities and their agents is often
 tenuous and most frequently forms a broad boundary against what they 
should <i>not</i> do rather than what they should. The <i>Wheel of Time </i>d20 roleplaying game does not feature any divine-type magic wielders, and playing standard <b>D&amp;D</b>
 in a setting with dualistic powers -- such as these, with a distant 
Creator and an imprisoned Destroyer -- could be difficult, though you 
could use any of the rationales available in an atheistic world.</p>
<p class="size2">Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth is generally of this 
same type, with a distant Creator in Eru and an imprisoned Destroyer, 
both in the original rebel Melkor/Morgoth imprisoned in the "outer 
darkness" at the end of the First Age, and his successor, Sauron, 
imprisoned as a shadow of his former self without the One Ring. We again
 see a world without any real organized religion and whose divine 
referents most commonly occur in songs, sayings, traditions, and other 
folkways. The <i>Middle-Earth Role-Playing</i> game did include 
divine-type characters, but really more as a concession to the way 
gamers have grown accustomed to playing (that is, with readily available
 divine healing) than because they really fit the game setting.</p>
<p class="size2">What differentiates Tolkien from Donaldson and Jordan 
is the existence of an entire absentee pantheon. To the residents of 
Middle-Earth, this pantheon takes the place of the absentee Creator as 
the presumptive "good" side of the divine equation, since the Creator 
himself is unknown to the general populace. Like the distant Creator of 
the other worlds, however, they virtually never insert themselves into 
the world (at least since the end of the First Age), instead providing 
indirect and implicit support to those fighting against the Destroyer. 
In a technical sense, the wizards and balrog(s) and creatures of that 
nature are minor godlings, but they have no real religious significance 
and thus, in a theological sense, are no different from Jordan's 
Forsaken or <i>ta'veren</i> or Donaldson's <i>gravelingas</i> or High 
Lords or white gold wielder. They are merely functionaries or agents for
 or against one side or the other. They are servants, but not proselytes
 for the cause.</p>
<p class="size2">David Eddings' Belgariad series (and its sequel) again 
has a distant Creator in UL and an imprisoned Destroyer in the sleeping 
Torak. Like Tolkien, the distant Creator is represented in everyday 
cosmology by a good-and-neutral pantheon of mostly distant deities. 
Unlike the other worlds, however, the gods of this world (besides being 
uniquely nationalistic in character) have full-fledged priesthoods, some
 of whom possess certain magical powers. Most magic-wielders do not seem
 to gain their powers directly from their divine patron, so it could be 
argued whether they were real "clerics" as <b>D&amp;D</b> would think of
 them, but it's enough of a correlation that it could be used reasonably
 in a game with such a pantheon. As in the other worlds, most "priests" 
would be experts or perhaps adepts, but a larger proportion would be 
spellcasters of some stripe. Of more direct importance, the favored 
servants of the gods can call upon the aid of the gods, and the gods 
themselves can and do pop into the story from time to time to take 
direct action (or to directly empower one of their servants). 
Interestingly, the gods themselves (with the possible exception of UL) 
are also depicted as subservient to a certain higher cosmological law in
 the form of competing good and evil destinies for the universe, and 
this fits well with the standard <b>D&amp;D</b> premise of a bounded planar framework within which deities must operate -- they are <i>not</i> above the law of the universe (with the exception of an "overpower," such as UL in this world or Ao in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> setting).</p>
<p class="size2">Maybe more interesting from a DM's perspective is 
Eddings' second set of books, the Elenium and Tamuli, which contain a 
mix of divine traditions. The Elenes were monotheists (of a distant 
Creator), the Rendors fanatic monotheists of a somewhat different 
tradition, the Styrics pantheists, and the Zemochs yet a different kind 
of monotheists (worshipers of the destroyer Azash), plus the pantheon of
 the trolls. On the far side of the world were monotheistic followers of
 the Elene god but with a separate church hierarchy as well as the 
cosmopolitan empire of the Tamuls. There is a sort of ecumenism implicit
 in this cosmology, because <i>all</i> of the gods were real, and some 
would appear personally and talk about the other gods and their 
relationships or would interfere directly in the affairs of mortals when
 it suited them. The gods could teach the secrets of magic to their 
servants and would allow them to teach those secrets to people of other 
faiths. (The Elene church knights could and did learn the magical 
"secrets of Styricum," though some within the church objected to 
"polluting" the faith.) Hence, even though they did not often directly 
empower their followers, they could teach the followers the secrets 
needed to use magic. If this is the rationale by which clerics learn 
magic, then such a world would mesh perfectly with <b>D&amp;D</b>; if the use of divine magic is more faith-based, then this model would obviously create problems.</p>
<p class="size2">The <b>interrelationships of whatever deities may exist</b><b>are a key point in deciding how divinity will play out</b> in your campaign world. In <b>Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms,</b> and <b>Dragonlance,</b>
 divine pluralism is the order of the day. Certain deities may be more 
or less prevalent in particular areas, but you might reasonably expect 
to find a follower of any given deity nearly anywhere. Geographic 
pantheons are rare (for example, the Suel pantheon in <b>Greyhawk</b> or the Mulhorandi deities in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>), since the same deities are worshipped in locales thousands of miles apart. (However, in <b>Dragonlance</b>,
 the deities may have different names depending on the race worshipping 
the deities.) Racial pantheons are often universal for those races in a 
similar worldwide fashion, with the exception being <b>Dragonlance</b>. 
All followers of particular deities usually fit a fairly standard 
profile, and most believers are not persecuted for their faith unless 
they got into mischief, though they might not be fully trusted by those 
they meet who hold different views.</p>
<p class="size2">All of the above is the standard <b>D&amp;D</b> model 
for how religions fit into the world, and it works perfectly well if the
 religion and cosmology of the world and its various cultures is not 
something about which it is particularly important to you to spend a lot
 of time detailing. If you are looking for a way to enrich the depth of 
your campaign world, however, you could spend some time pondering the 
way religion fits into the cultures of your game world. In creating a 
campaign world, you should think about <b>how radically (if at all) you want to change the cosmological framework </b>of
 your world and the deities (if any) that inhabit or influence it. 
Deciding what is happening in the heavens above (or the hells below) can
 be a great tool for framing the action that will transpire on the world
 where the adventure will take place, infusing it with meaning and 
significance. As a certain TV personality would say: "That's a good 
thing."</p>
<p class="size2">[1] The factions of the <b>Planescape</b> setting could be useful examples of devotion to a philosophy or creed that gird an atheistic divine caster's power.</p>
