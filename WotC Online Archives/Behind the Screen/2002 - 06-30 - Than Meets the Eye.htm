<p class="size2">In the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/bs/bs20020531a">last article</a>, we examined the implications of change in the design and management of a <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, including pitfalls to avoid and strategies to try while 
implementing changes in your campaign. The idea of changing rules, 
campaign settings, or any elements of your campaign and the game that 
you play presumes that you know what it is that you are changing. For 
that reason, this column will deal with perhaps the most obvious 
fundamental of running the game -- <b>know the rules</b>! This may seem like an absurdly simple point on which to base a column. I don't dispute that the point <i>should</i>
 be readily apparent to all, but in this column I will explain how a 
DM's knowledge of the rules (or lack thereof) impacts a game and how a 
DM who puts effort into mastering the rules can enhance the quality of 
his or her game.</p>
<p class="size2">If you are serving as DM, you should possess 
familiarity with the rules that you intend to use in the campaign, 
including where to find what you cannot recall off-hand. The <b>use of tools</b>
 such as a DM screen, self-made references (copying or compiling 
important tables or marking and tabbing pages in rulebooks), or 
computerized DM utilities (some of which are available on the Internet, 
with most for PCs but a few for Mac) can make your job much easier as 
well. Essentially, if you can't remember it, place the information you 
need at your fingertips. The ultimate goal you want to achieve is to 
avoid halting the flow of the game to look up references and to minimize
 the time and effort of finding things when you do have to stop and 
look. It is important to get the correct ruling, but it is also 
important to minimize disruption to the flow of the game. If you have 
mastered the rules, disruptions become minimal and allow the game to run
 more smoothly, which in turn better maintains the mood, tone, and 
immersion within the fantasy world for the players and for you.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1. Know the rules. Pay special attention to 
mechanics-heavy rules like combat rules, because those are the areas 
most likely to slow the game down.</p>
<p class="size2">2. Create (or purchase) some quick reference tools to access needed tables or other information quickly.</p>
<p class="size2">3. When making rules interpretations and judgment 
calls, base your rationale (as much as possible) on the rules; being 
able to explain the reasoning behind your judgment helps minimize 
arguments or complaints.</p>
<p class="size2">4. Be aware of the capabilities of the characters (and 
the skill of the players in using them) as well as the challenges you 
select for them. Look for the nuances of how the two interact along the 
lines set forth in the rules and make sure to account for variations in 
how you do it vs. the "standard" laid out in the rules.</p>
<p class="size2">5. Rules swing both ways: Anything you can do within the rules the characters can, too, and vice versa.</p>
</td>

<p class="size2">The term "rules lawyer" is bandied about, mostly in a 
derogatory way, to describe players who bend, twist, and mangle the 
rules to maximize advantages and minimize deficiencies (also known as 
"min-maxing"). In a courtroom, however, lawyers can get away only with 
those tactics that the judge allows, and you, as DM, must take on the 
role of judge in your game. To be an effective and credible judge, 
however, you must first demonstrate that you are a competent master of 
the fine points of the law -- in this case, the rules of the game. This 
does not mean that you must have every jot and tittle of rules minutiae 
on the tip of your tongue at any moment, but more than a passing 
familiarity is required. A DM who frequently interrupts the game to 
check references or who doesn't understand the rules may lose the 
confidence of players and is far more likely to spend time in 
discussions about rules interpretations.</p>
<p class="size2">As per the immortal "Rule 0," you, the DM, always have 
the final say in arguments over the game or the rules, but the use of DM
 fiat in place of reasoned and informed argument is high-handed and can 
seem capricious if invoked too frequently. Furthermore, it may frustrate
 and even alienate the players, who for their part have final say over 
whether they wish to continue playing in your campaign. You can avoid 
much frustration simply by having a good understanding of the rules. 
Knowing the rules well can increase your confidence in running the game 
since you should know how to competently address nearly any situation. 
Should a disagreement arise, a DM who knows the rules can make informed 
rulings and interpretations and (equally importantly) can <b>present the rationale</b>
 for the rulings that are made. Even if a player doesn't ultimately 
agree with your call, at least he or she can see the logical chain that 
led to it if you can express your rationale. Knowing the rules well also
 puts you in a far better position to fend off attempts by rules-savvy 
players who like to bend the rules to their advantage.</p>
<p class="size2">Quite apart from helping you become the manager of your
 game, a thorough knowledge of the rules is a great asset to you as an 
architect. When designing adventures (either homemade or adapted from 
published sources), knowing the rules well allows you to create 
appropriate challenges and rewards for the kind of game you are running.
 If you are not careful, you may create encounter situations that are 
either a death trap or a cake walk, with rewards that range from floor 
sweepings in a peanut factory to Monty Haul. The most recent edition of <b>D&amp;D</b> has made a much more explicit effort than prior editions at defining appropriate challenges and rewards (especially in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>,
 pages 100-103, 144-145, 165-172), which not only provide quick guides 
to individual situations but also a level-by-level checking mechanism to
 see how well your campaign matches up with the presumptive archetypal 
adventuring party. Whether your group fits this typical mold is not 
important in and of itself, but it <i>is</i> important for you to judge 
in which direction it deviates if it is different, because the game 
makes certain assumptions in the way that it assigns CRs, ELs, and so 
forth.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>SPECIAL TIPS</b></p>
<p class="size2">1. Make sure everyone knows which rules are being used 
(including rules that have been subsequently modified by "official 
errata"). Have a rationale for any changes you make from the basic rule 
set (<i>Player's Handbook, <b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>).</p>
<p class="size2">2. Don't allow in a new rule just because it's in print somewhere, whether it is from an "official' <b>D&amp;D</b> source or elsewhere. You should look at the rule and decide how it will impact your campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">3. If a rule seems outrageous, make sure you understand
 the rule and its effects as completely as possible before passing 
judgment on it.</p>
<p class="size2">4. Disallow rules that you find unbalance your game or make it less fun.</p>
<p class="size2">5. Don't create challenges that simply negate the 
abilities that you know the party possesses. Focus instead on using the 
rules to challenge them and force them to use and apply the abilities, 
skills, and knowledge that they have to succeed.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">As an example, the game's design assumes that PCs as 
low as 4th or even 3rd level have the resources to acquire magic 
weapons, so creatures rated as being an appropriate challenge for a 3rd 
or 4th level party may well have damage resistance to nonmagic weapons. 
Obviously, if in your campaign the party is at that level and doesn't 
have magic weapons, then encounters will be much more difficult and 
warrant a higher CR or a situation-specific increase in rewards (both XP
 and treasure) commensurate with the increased challenge. The fact that 
the typical party parameters are explicitly spelled out makes it much 
easier to judge the degree and direction of deviation from that norm in 
your campaign. Knowing these rules and understanding how they work 
together allows you to compensate for special circumstances or more 
general differences in how you structure challenges and rewards in your 
campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">To extend this point a bit further, knowing the rules 
well allows you to understand not only the structure of the 
challenge/reward system and how to compare and match CRs and ELs, but 
also to understand the nuances of the particular abilities that both the
 party and their enemies bring to any meeting. This point applies to 
noncombat encounters as well, but a thorough knowledge of the rules is 
more vital in combat situations since they are generally much more 
game-mechanically based. You don't have to tell every secret and explain
 the mechanics of every creature they face. After all, much of the 
excitement of playing is the challenge of puzzling out how to overcome a
 challenge when you don't know what to expect or when you don't have 
full information on the situation. They may not know why an attack 
doesn't work against their foe or how it countered one of their own 
abilities, and on and on, but <i>you</i> should know how a creature's 
attack or defense or movement capabilities work and how to apply them in
 the game. Creatures with reach, flight, or incorporeal characteristics 
will fight in ways that maximize their advantages, and so it goes with 
any creature's abilities.</p>
<p class="size2">This concept applies not only to the challenges the 
party will face but also the party itself. After all, how can you 
prepare adequate challenges if you don't fully <b>understand what the characters can do</b>?
 You do not need to be an expert on every character (that is the 
player's job!), but you should have a good handle on what the character 
is capable of doing. You should not overplay such knowledge by always 
negating the players' advantages, but you should not be taken by 
surprise (or not often, at any rate) by what a character can do. You 
must take the general tactical capabilities of the party into account 
when designing challenges for them so that you can make sure that 
encounters are not outside the party's capabilities or that they are so 
easy as to be meaningless (unless there is some story-based reason for 
such an extreme encounter).</p>
<p class="size2">The basic rulebooks provide useful examples and 
diagrams (for example., spell areas of effect) that can clarify how 
things work, and some of the class-based sourcebooks (for example, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11829">Sword and Fist</a></i>) do this as well. <b>D&amp;D</b> also addresses rules applications in a wide range of special cases fairly consistently, with features in <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dragon/">Dragon</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dragon/"> Magazine</a></i> ("Power Play") or elsewhere on this website ("<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/gs/gs20020519a">Gamestoppers</a>").
 While the game is not solely a number-crunching exercise, math is 
undeniably a part of the game, and by making explicit the ways that 
rules can be used (especially in combination), <b>D&amp;D</b> greatly 
assists those who might not be inclined to think that way on their own. 
Players who want to min-max have always and will always do so, but 
having tools such as these built into the game system helps prevent such
 players from taking undue advantage of the system or less savvy (or 
less conniving, if you prefer) players and DMs. The above refers only to
 those "official" suggestions, hints, and ideas proffered by Wizards of 
the Coast; players and DMs can turn to innumerable other resources for 
advice and ideas on how to use or interpret the rules. Online newsgroups
 (such as Usenet's rec.games.frp.dnd), mailing lists, and the like 
provide venues for asking questions and discussing (or sometimes 
arguing) ideas from other gamers around the world, including URLs to a 
host of personalized <b>D&amp;D</b>-related sites. For those who don't follow such groups on a regular basis, many are archived on www.google.com. </p>
<p class="size2">The most important rule of thumb when it comes to 
knowing the rules is the old saying: What's good for the goose is good 
for the gander. When a player does come up with something creative, feel
 free to borrow it for your own use. <b>If the players can do it, then so can the bad guys.</b>
 Knowing the rules and knowing the capabilities of the characters (and 
the players) can help you anticipate their moves and choices and counter
 them, though you should be careful not to overplay your DM knowledge 
with what the villains might reasonably expect to know. Likewise, if you
 come up with a devious interpretation of the rules to use against the 
players, be certain that they will try to use it against you. Depending 
on your campaign, you may want to make some spells, items, prestige 
classes, and the like available on a limited basis (such as limiting the
 blackguard prestige class to only villains); as a result, they are 
options open to you but not open to the players. There is nothing wrong 
with this in principle, but you should be very careful to weigh whether 
the options available to each side to ensure a level playing field. For 
the DM, "playing fair" is not a matter of making things easy on the 
players, but rather making sure that everyone at the gaming table has a 
fair opportunity to succeed. When you know the rules and know them well,
 you can ensure that everyone is presented with fair challenges, 
reasonable rewards, and equal opportunities. That is the essence of a 
good game.</p>
