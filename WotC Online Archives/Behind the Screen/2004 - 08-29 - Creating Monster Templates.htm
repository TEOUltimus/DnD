<p align="LEFT">Welcome back to our Behind the Screen workshop on 
building campaign story arcs. Our fictional DM, Eddie, is building a 
theme around an ancient race of frog-folk called sivs, and we're using 
his process as a model for creating your own unique campaigns.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What do you do when you want a creature that fits a 
theme? The obvious answer is to first look at the monsters that already 
exist. Why make more work for yourself? If you're doing a freaky jungle 
adventure, look for freaky jungle monsters (mmm? ahuizotl). Also, make 
liberal use of jungle animals -- things from the real natural world can 
be quite vicious, especially if massaged a bit in terms of feats. (See 
the earlier "<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20020808a">When Animals Attack</a>"
 column). You can, of course, create entirely new monsters (or new 
natural animals that have not previously been given game statistics), 
but we'll discuss that in next month's column.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Last month's article dealt specifically with feats, 
including "regional feats" and tying together a race of creatures 
through the use of a common set of feats. Any intelligent creature can 
have feats, so you could use that method to tailor a creature (like the 
animals noted above). For many monsters, however, that doesn't quite 
feel right, and I also pointed out that there should be limits on what 
you can do with a feat. Sometimes you want to make more basic or more 
powerful changes than would be warranted by just adding a feat (or even 
several feats).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Still, you want a way to make the changes to monsters 
feel connected to the theme, not just random. You want a certain unified
 feeling that says these creatures are part of the theme. Take <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882370000">Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil</a></i> as an example. Who are the main antagonists in that campaign? Evil elemental cultists and their demon allies. There are <i>lots</i>
 of monsters in that supermodule, so it's not just a boring one-note 
hack-fest of cookie-cutter monsters, but fiendish, half-fiend, and 
(especially) half-elemental templates crop up throughout. You could 
probably play up this angle even more with elemental templates from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882420000">Manual of the Planes</a></i>,
 if you want to reinforce the theme more strongly, but it's in there 
well enough to pound home the theme in-game. This is not just some 
random dungeon with random creatures. This is the Temple of <i>Elemental Evil</i>! Creatures there are elemental, and they are evil -- or if not, it won't be long before you meet something that is.</p>

<p align="center"><b>MUNCHINGS AND CRUNCHINGS</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This sample template offers a rules-eye view of the general ideas in this month's column.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creating a Ba'traa creature:</b> "Ba'traa" is an 
acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature except a 
construct, elemental, ooze, or plant (referred to hereafter as the base 
creature). A ba'traa creature uses all the base creatures statistics and
 special abilities except as noted here.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Size and Type:</b> The creature's type remains the same, but it gains the aquatic subtype. Size is unchanged.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Speed:</b> A ba'traa creature gains a swim speed 
equal to one-half its highest nonflying speed. If the creature already 
has a swim speed, use the better of its normal swim speed or its ba'traa
 swim speed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Attacks:</b> A ba'traa creature gains a tongue attack
 as a secondary natural weapon (-5 attack, 1/2 Strength bonus to 
damage). Like a whip, a tongue attack cannot harm a creature with an 
armor bonus of +1 or greater or a natural armor bonus of +3 or greater. 
The tongue can also be used to make a trip attack or to deliver a touch 
attack. A ba'traa creature of size Large or larger can use the tongue 
try to draw a creature to itself. Treat this as a bull rush attack, 
except that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity and the attack 
it may be used only to move a creature closer to the ba'traa creature by
 the most direct route possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Attacks:</b> A ba'traa creature has all the special attacks of the base creature, and it also gains the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Hopping charge (Ex):</i> A ba'traa creature may use 
the Jump skill as part of a charge. If it is able to make at least a 
10-foot leap during a charge, a ba'traa creature gains a +1 bonus on 
attack rolls (in addition to the normal +2 bonus for charging) and 
inflicts extra damage on a successful hit, based on its size: Fine 1, 
Diminutive 1d2, Tiny 1d3, Small 1d4, Medium 1d6, Large 1d8, Huge 2d6, 
Gargantuan 3d6, Colossal 4d6.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Qualities:</b> A ba'traa creature has all the special qualities of the base creature, plus low-light vision. It also gains the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Amphibious (Ex):</i> A ba'traa creature may breathe air or water as needed, without difficulty.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Siv subservience (Ex):</i> A ba'traa creature suffers
 a -10 racial penalty to Will saves vs. any effect used against it by a 
siv. Sivs gain a +10 bonus to Charisma checks (including Charisma-based 
skill checks) made against a ba'traa creature.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Toxic skin (Ex):</i> Contact poison, initial and 
secondary damage 1d3 Dex, Fortitude save DC 10 + 1/2 the ba'traa 
creature's racial hit dice + the ba'traa creature's Constitution 
modifier. This poison may affect any creature using unarmed attacks, 
natural weapons, or touch attacks against the ba'traa creature, assuming
 the ba'traa creature is unarmored.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a ba'traa creature wears light armor, anyone 
attacking it with unarmed attacks, natural weapons, or touch attacks 
gains a +4 bonus to avoid the effects of the poison, except that 
creatures grappling with it must save normally. If a ba'traa creature is
 wearing medium or heavy armor, only creatures it grapples must save, 
and they receive a +4 bonus to their saving throw. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Wide-angle vision (Ex):</i> A ba'traa creature gains a
 +2 bonus to Spot checks, and creatures flanking it gain only a +1 bonus
 to hit. A ba'traa creature suffers a -2 penalty to saving throws vs. 
gaze attacks, patterns, and dazzling or blinding effects with the light 
descriptor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Abilities:</b> Change from the base creature as follows: +2 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Wis, -6 Cha.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> A ba'traa creature has a +8 racial bonus 
on Jump checks, and it may use either its Strength or its Dexterity 
modifier, whichever is better.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because it has a swim speed, a ba'traa creature has a +8
 racial bonus on any Swim checks to perform some special action or avoid
 a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if 
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, 
provided it swims in a straight line.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">That kind of feel is what Eddie is striving for. Not 
that every creature in the jungle is a siv or a siv-servant, but lots of
 them are, and he wants that fact to be in evidence. The sivs are 
supposed to be arrogant elitists who believe they are the exemplars of 
perfection. What better vanity project for their arrogance than to use 
their power and knowledge to make everyone else just like them? This 
background detail is one of those things that can be a key point for the
 DM even if the players never discover it. It helps everything hang 
together and make sense inside <i>your</i> head, and regardless of 
whether the PCs figure it out, it will make you more confident in 
pursuing your vision and presenting a coherent campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thinking about the reason why you're using the template 
is important not just for your mental health and well-being as DM. It 
also helps you make sensible choices. What is really important in the 
template you use? What game mechanics do you want? SR? DR? Spell-like 
abilities? Stat bonuses? What are the thematic elements you want? How do
 you balance those? How about special weaknesses? Is the template 
something that occurs naturally (e.g., fiendish creatures are not much 
different from regular creatures, but grew up in a fiendish environment)
 or something that you can acquire (like lycanthropy or vampirism)? If 
acquired, can you get rid of it? Does the template breed true, or create
 crossbreeds or spawn? Is there an in-game creator of the template? Why 
and how do they use the template on others?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Okay, so templates make sense and they're good for 
building a theme. The obvious question is which template to use. First, 
as always, look at what you can find and see if the work is already done
 for you, unless you have tons of free time and want to do it just for 
fun. Unfortunately, Eddie couldn't find pre-made templates that really 
fit what he's looking for, so it's to the drawing board (with a little 
help from a buddy -- DMs have to stick together!).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eddie's basic idea is that the sivs use their magical secrets to genetically alter creatures into amphibian forms -- the <i>ba'traa --</i>
 mutating them into something closer to their vision of amphibian 
perfection. Now we know why the sivs are always trying to stun or 
entangle or capture people: They're going to sell the lot of them for 
medical experiments! The resulting creatures could be mutated from 
almost anything, so the PCs could run into a variety of freaky froggies,
 all with slimy wet skin, hopping and swimming about, sticking out their
 long, slimy tongues, and meeting the PCs in the direct service of their
 siv masters. Maybe one of the PCs will get captured, receive the full 
treatment, and return to face the party -- or will need to be rescued 
just in the nick of time to avoid being made into a frogged-out horror!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once you've established your rationale and your style, 
you need game mechanics. What is the basic creature concept -- things 
like type, size, and habitat? How does it move? Your theme will give you
 direction here: Apply types or subtypes appropriate to the theme. (The 
frog-infused ba'traa are amphibious and therefore aquatic; the type 
could change -- aberration might work -- or leave it unchanged for 
simplicity). Decide if some types just don't fit the template. If we're 
talking enslaved mutates, for example, oozes, plants, constructs, and 
elementals probably don't make sense. Undead and outsiders are common 
template exclusions, but in a weird way they actually fit with the 
ba'traa concept (frog-mutants enslaved even in death, or imposing 
amphibian dominion even on extraplanars). Size will usually stay the 
same (unless you're using a miniature or hulked-out theme), but speed 
may change; the amphibious ba'traa will need a swim speed (which besides
 the obvious also grants combat advantages in aquatic combat). </p>
<p align="LEFT">Having a swim speed also affects the Swim skill, and 
this is a good reminder that you should think about racial bonuses to 
skills or bonus feats. Before you go too far into the exotica of your 
template, make sure to cover the basics! This also includes basic 
statistics -- does the template make creatures more or less agile, 
strong, smart, etc.? If your template is based on a natural creature 
(like a frog), you can work in some of that creature's intrinsic traits 
when thinking about adjustments to ability scores. </p>
<p align="LEFT">When it comes to combat, many templates add special 
attacks. If you have cool ideas, great, but you can also cut and paste 
pieces of other ideas that don't work intact for you. Eddie keeps 
contemplating frogs' long, sticky tongues, and he saw that the Chameleon
 template from <i>Underdark</i> has a tongue attack, but it wasn't quite
 what he wanted. Still, he could adopt part of the template, or tweak 
the part that he likes to get it right. If grapple checks are overused, 
maybe he could devise a variant tongue attack that works like a bull 
rush attack in reverse (a quick straight-line jerk that pulls <i>toward</i> the tongue-attacker instead pushing away from it), or maybe a trip or disarm attack like a whip.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Besides attacks, you can also add in special qualities 
that fit your theme. Some might be basic game concepts -- damage 
reduction, SR, energy resistances, or even magical powers. Others might 
resemble feats, but are maybe just a touch too strong or too weird to be
 a true feat. Ba'traa could have wide-angle vision like frogs, and of 
course the toxic skin that spawned the whole template idea. The poison 
is really more of a defensive thing (like real-life poisonous frogs), so
 it needn't be designed for attack. Still, it's a contact poison, so 
Eddie needs to work out how easy it is to be affected by it with 
different kinds of attacks (e.g., touch, grapple, melee weapon). It's 
sensible to make the poison ineffective (or less effective) if the 
creature is wearing armor, but in some ways this template is more for 
monsters than humanoid creatures anyway, so this needn't be much of a 
limitation.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Speaking of limitations, one tricky idea to add is a <i>weakness</i>
 as a special quality -- maybe a particular energy susceptibility, or 
skin that dries out on land, or light sensitivity. Eddie's idea, since 
these ba'traa are the sivs' slaves, is that they should have a special 
weakness against being controlled by their siv masters. Mind-affecting 
spells or even ordinary skills are much more effective when used by a 
siv against a ba'traa. Of course, PCs could turn this to their advantage
 if they can figure out this weakness and pose as sivs. . . .</p>
<p align="LEFT">Obviously, every special quality is different. Eddie's 
ba'traa is just one example of the steps you need to go through in 
creating something as complex as a template. Some templates will be very
 different; just make sure you tailor them to fit your theme. Templates 
can be simple power-ups, but use a little flavor and vision to make them
 really punch up the impact in your campaign.</p>
