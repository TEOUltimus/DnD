<p align="left"><i>Should you encourage invention of new spells and items?</i>
 Probably not, but do your best to nurture it when players show an 
interest. Of course, you can introduce new things for NPCs any time you 
like!</p>
<p align="left">2. <i>What does the new thing do?</i> Make sure the player can <i>fully </i>explain what the proposed item or spell can do, including any "little quirks" that might pop up later.</p>
<p align="left">3. <i>How does it compare to existing things?</i> Is it 
comparable in power, scope, and flavor to what is already allowed for 
the class or campaign? Don't force it to be inferior to existing 
material -- there is nothing wrong with PCs having something good. Just 
don't allow it to be <i>too</i> good!</p>
<p align="left">4. <i>Why is the </i>character<i> making it?</i> Where 
did this great inspiration come from? What does the character hope to 
achieve? Fame? Fortune? Filling in a deficiency in the character?</p>
<p align="left">5. <i>How will the campaign change by introducing the new thing?</i>
 Will others try to get a piece of the action? Will the new spell or 
item be stolen or copied (or even noticed at all)? How does the new 
thing interact with existing spells, items, and abilities? (Beware of 
power-stacking!) Most importantly, what can the character do with the 
new thing that he couldn't before, and what does that mean for you as 
DM?</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">David has created Rashean Bantecou as an extrovert, a 
glory hog, a larger-than-life personality. He enjoys playing him with 
bombast and panache, someone who is really "out there." David does this 
in part just for the fun of it, playing a character who is such a <i>character</i>,
 but also partly because he wants Rashean to make his mark in the world.
 He wants to establish his character's fame, and he figures a little bit
 of shameless self-promotion can't hurt! Still, David is sharp enough to
 know that people in the game world may not take Rashean's fame as 
seriously as he does. If all he does is <i>talk</i> about how great he is, he might get dismissed by NPCs as "a legend in his own mind." If you want to really<i> be</i> famous, you've got to <i>do</i> something or <i>make</i> something that people will know, remember, and recognize as uniquely yours.</p>
<p align="left">Fame is an archetypal motivation (and reward) for 
adventuring, and you might achieve it through legendary quests, great 
conquests, or just throwing a lot of money around. That kind of thing 
often gets you only local renown, however, and David has a plan for 
making Rashean's name known everywhere: Inventing a new spell and 
promoting it far and wide. If it gets picked up for popular circulation,
 maybe Rashean Bantecou can be like Bigby! How cool is that? To have 
other people cast a spell with your name on it!</p>
<p align="left">Of course, this is only one reason a character might 
create a new spell or magic item. Others might be happy with incidental 
fame en route to their true goals. Others might be secretive and shun 
publicity or share their new invention with only a select group -- other
 PCs, or people of their religion or alignment. The point is that 
characters have a lot of reasons for wanting to create spells or magic 
items, and the DM has to take those reasons into account. Eddie knows 
what David's character is all about and why he wants to create a new 
spell, but he might be more suspicious of Samantha and her devious 
powergaming tendencies. In your own game, let players make their case 
without prejudging what they are doing and why.</p>
<p align="left">As the DM, should you try to encourage invention? No. If
 players want to try new ideas, they'll come to you. If they're happy 
with the spells and items available in the game, stick with those. There
 are certainly plenty to fill any campaign with variety. Much 
item-making will simply be from players who want to make things for 
their personal use (or maybe for other party members): <i>cure wounds</i>
 wands, spell scrolls, stat-boosting items, magic weapons and armor. All
 things easily handled in the standard rules. This column is more about 
how to answer the call of a player with a new idea, either a new 
combination (e.g., an item that boosts several skills at once), a new 
modification (e.g., a standard item with a different "body slot" [see 
page 288 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>]), or something entirely novel.</p>
<p align="left">When a player gets the urge to try something out of the 
ordinary, you need to listen and see what you can do to make the idea a 
reality. Ask three basic questions: What does it do? How does it compare
 to what's already in the game? Why do you want to make this? The last 
question is really the first one to ask, because the answer to "Why?" 
may determine whether you bother going on to the nuts and bolts of the 
idea. The player should have some kind of in-game reason for why the 
character would try to make something like this new spell or item, or 
maybe where the inspiration for it came from. The vision may not 
actually turn out the way the player expects -- Rashean Bantecou's spell
 may never catch on as he hopes -- but the player gets to roll the dice 
and take his chances.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, we know that players can be sneaky little 
weasels. So even if one has a decent rationale you may have to look 
closely at what the item or spell is and what it does to see the real 
reason behind it. Comparisons are especially important for spells to 
make sure they are in line with both the power and the general scope of 
spell lists for each class. You need a good grasp of what spells do in 
the rules so you can compare the different elements of the spell and see
 how the new idea measures up. Use the precedents in the rules and 
assess how the proposed idea compares to them.</p>
<p align="left">Spells that cross over into the specialty of another 
class should be nixed, or at least heavily restricted, as should spells 
that go too far outside the bounds of what is laid out in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. Bards just don't get spells like <i>magic missile</i> or <i>raise dead</i>,
 so players of bards shouldn't be able to research spells too similar to
 them. A spell that is similar to an off-list spell is in iffy 
territory, but should be different enough to really be <i>different</i> (not just switching the type of damage) and/or of a higher level.</p>
<p align="left">More devious is the character who sets up a spell or 
item to stack with class abilities or optimize their use. Some 
supervicious items can be made cheaply by limiting their use to once per
 day, but if used in combination with other "once per day" abilities 
they can be devastating, especially at double-digit levels. Other powers
 should be <i>only</i> limited use or charged as items, less for combat-type abilities than for utility powers or permanent effects (e.g., <i>arcane lock, fly, identify, invisibility, knock, passwall, silence, wall of stone</i>).</p>
<p align="left">You and the player might not agree on how a spell or 
item idea should work, and you should favor the integrity of the 
campaign over a new idea that you think is fundamentally broken. Work 
hard to avoid an impasse, though, because you don't want to squelch the 
creative impulse. Players will have more ownership and investment in the
 campaign if they can see their handiwork in it and that they can have a
 lasting impact. Plus, if they make it work once they may be tempted to 
try it again, and that's what you want.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, you might get a real eager beaver who drops a
 dozen spell descriptions and five magic item ideas in your lap, making 
more work than you really wanted, but that's part of the gig of DMing. 
Your player has made an effort and you owe him your best effort in 
working with him. If it's too much, then you ask for patience in getting
 around to it. But at the end of the day if you want to sit Behind the 
Screen, you gotta be ready to take whatever comes and run with it!</p>
