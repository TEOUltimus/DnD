<p align="LEFT">Welcome to Part 7 of our Behind the Screen workshop on <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/bs">building campaign story arcs</a>.
 Our fictional DM, Eddie, is building a theme around an ancient race of 
frog-folk called sivs, and we're using his process as a model for 
creating your own unique campaigns. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The social angle on divine magic is an important element and one that sometimes we drop too easily in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 games without taking advantage of the potential for enriching the 
campaign world. Religion has power apart from the magic mojo wielded by 
its leading adherents. If the priestly caste is able to assume control 
through its power over the minds and hearts of the masses, it can work 
to suppress other forms of magic and assure its own dominant position. 
That's pretty much how Eddie has set up the siv city of Batul Darab.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The priests being large and in charge means they need 
their magic to have a little kick, to be fun and different. Even if they
 were the gutter-swine of their society, they would still need something
 special about their magic, but it would be less important for the 
campaign overall. For Eddie, just as the sivs are his main villains, the
 siv priests are the main villains <i>among</i> the main villains, so 
they need to pop. In this month's article and the next, we'll talk about
 kicking up your priests and their magic another notch.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Obviously, you could make up new stuff for your priests 
to do, but in a way that's too easy. Why not try making something new 
out of something old? Take a fresh look at what you thought was stale, 
and see if you can weave it together in a new and interesting way. That 
is what Eddie has decided to do in trying to craft a new Jungle domain 
(see sidebar) out of entirely standard, official spells and abilities 
from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/175240000">Player's Handbook</a></i>.
 The jungle is the major terrain feature of Batul Darab. This is a 
domain that would be a natural for the sivs to access through their 
patron, Wastri, though other deities could use it (e.g., Fenmarel 
Mestarine of the elves, Thard Harr of the dwarves, Ubtao in the <b>Forgotten Realms,</b> or any deity of yuan-ti or other jungle-dwellers, such as races using the jungle template from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881560000">Unearthed Arcana</a></i>). </p>
<p align="LEFT">When thinking about making a cleric domain, start with 
its defining characteristic. Try to free-associate with the theme. For 
Eddie, several things come to mind when he thinks "jungle": oppressive 
heat, clinging damp, vines, waterfalls, rainbows in the mist. A zillion 
bugs. Leeches! Huge, beautiful flowers. Monsoon rains. Monkeys and 
elephants and lions and leopards and snakes and poisonous frogs . . . 
you get the picture. Even if something isn't technically a "jungle" 
element in the real world, if it feels like something jungle-ish, like 
dinosaurs or volcanoes or earthquakes, use it! This is a fantasy world, 
and as long as it feels right, it can work.</p>
<p align="LEFT">With your free-associations in mind, think about how you
 might work up a list of spells and a granted power. Eddie is sticking 
to the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, so where can he find something jungle-appropriate for a granted power? He might try an <i>endure elements</i>-like
 ability, so clerics could wear their armor in the jungle heat. That's a
 great advantage in terms of game mechanics, but it doesn't really fit 
the feel of the jungle theme. <i>Pass</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What else defines the jungle? Well, it's impassable and 
tangled, right? Perhaps something like a druid's woodland stride would 
prove handy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That's pretty weak for a granted power all by itself 
(though it would work if the spells in the domain were truly potent and 
useful). For a domain full of less-than-stellar spells, something more 
powerful, or a couple of lesser abilities, would be in order. Still 
looking at the druid, it would be tempting to add something like wild 
empathy, but maybe restrict it to jungle-based creatures. Of course, 
that's not much of a limitation since most clerics with the Jungle 
domain will be spending their time <i>in the jungle</i>. In other words,
 he would have just given out two druid class abilities for one domain. 
What are the poor Jungle druids going to think?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Following the precedent of adding class skills to the 
cleric list might prove a better solution than raiding the druid's class
 features. Escape Artist could make sense for getting out of tangled 
vines and other vegetation, but it is made superfluous by woodland 
stride. Still, the whole getting-around-in-the-trees angle is a good 
idea, so maybe we should add Climb and (since it actually makes a lot of
 sense, what with splicing vines together and such) Use Rope as class 
skills. Adding more than one class skill as a granted power is pretty 
generous, but several domains do so. Woodland stride, however, is 
comparatively weak for a primary granted power, and Climb and Use Rope 
are hardly unbalancing skills, so it's a decent package, provided the 
spell list isn't overpowered.</p>
<p align="LEFT">On to spells! Again, sticking to the standard <i>Player's Handbook</i> spells, we can still get our jungle traits across. Tangled plants and vines? How about <i>entangle, snare, spike growth</i>, and maybe <i>wall of thorns</i>? Spells like <i>warp wood</i> and <i>ironwood</i> are tempting as well, as in the jungle metal might prove scarce -- adding value to spells that affect wooden weapons. <i>Rusting grasp</i>
 could represent the tendency of metal items to corrode, but how useful 
would that really be if metal items are supposed to be scarce? Rainbows 
in the mist? <i>Obscuring mist</i> or <i>fog cloud</i> is a possibility, but they already show up on several domain lists. <i>Rainbow pattern</i>, on the other hand, is interesting and thematic as an unusual spell for clerics. A spell like <i>sunbeam</i> or <i>sunburst</i> or maybe <i>scorching ray</i> could represent the oppressive heat of the jungle (so could <i>heat metal</i>, but remember what we said about <i>rusting grasp</i>). <i>Contagion</i> or <i>poison</i> could represent all the nasty little toxic or pestilent surprises the jungle can hold, while <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>remove disease</i>
 could be designated as domain spells specifically to counter such 
blights upon the people serving the powers that grant this domain. <i>Earthquake</i> or maybe <i>incendiary cloud</i> (like an exhalation of superheated volcanic gases) might get to that hot, primal nature feel.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eddie should also consider spells that work with jungle wildlife. <i>Summon swarm</i>
 appears an obvious choice, especially if freshened up with new swarm 
types that fit the setting better than rats and bats (such as <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20040926a">leech swarms</a>). <i>Insect plague</i> could also fit, as would <i>creeping doom</i>. <i>Repel vermin</i> might be a nice addition, considering the prevalence of such creatures in the jungle. <i>Animal growth</i> or <i>animal shapes</i> could easily be made to fit the jungle concept, and something like <i>liveoak </i>(though oak trees may be in short supply in the jungle) or <i>shambler</i> could make the jungle greenery come alive to attack! Lastly, spells in the <i>summon nature's ally</i>
 family are a (pardon the pun) natural fit for the Jungle domain, 
especially if tailored a bit. Eddie might restrict what can be summoned 
with this spell as a Jungle domain spell (as the aligned domains do with
 their <i>summon monster</i> domain spell), stipulating that the spell 
can summon only creatures that fit with a jungle theme, such as normal, 
giant, or dire apes (maybe girallons could be included if the selection 
of summon nature's ally spells fits that creature), crocodiles, 
dinosaurs, elephants, lions, snakes, or tigers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In deciding which spells to use, a DM must be selective.
 If Eddie just chose all animal-summoning spells, the domain becomes 
kind of boring and one-note. Besides, this isn't the Animal Summoning 
domain, it's the Jungle domain! It has to feature a little bit of 
everything. Also, in assigning levels to spells as domain spells, 
exercise care. You can change spell levels from their normal level, 
because some domain spells are supposed to be a little better than 
regular spells (like <i>antimagic field</i>, which is an 8th-level 
cleric spell but only 6th level in the Magic and Protection domains), 
but you wouldn't, for example, want priests of a Jungle domain to be 
better at doing animal stuff than those of the Animal domain. In 
general, it's best to stick the spells at their regular levels, or maybe
 a level higher if it's a spell not normally on the cleric list 
(especially if it's normally an arcane spell, like <i>rainbow pattern</i>).
 In any case, the more powerful and useful the spell list, the weaker 
the granted power or powers should be, and the weaker the spell list, 
the more powerful the granted power should be.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As you can see in the sidebar, Eddie's final choices were eclectic. <i>Entangle</i> was an automatic. He ended up passing on <i>summon swarm</i> because <i>creeping doom</i>
 seemed like a better fit for the jungle and he didn't want two spells 
that were so similar in type (though obviously different in power). <i>Warp wood</i> seemed to fit well with the low-metal jungle concept. He chose <i>poison</i> over <i>contagion</i>
 mainly because he didn't like having a spell with the evil descriptor 
in a domain that might be granted by a nonevil deity with good clerics; 
if the domain were just for the sivs, it would have been no problem. 
Still, the sivs are more about poison than disease anyway, so it's all 
good. <i>Rainbow pattern</i> proved just too much fun to pass up, and <i>wall of thorns</i> fit as well. He did include two <i>summon nature's ally</i>
 spells, selected at their particular levels because they offered the 
best range of jungle-type creatures that he wanted. For the 
highest-level spell, <i>shambler</i> narrowly edged out <i>incendiary cloud</i>, <i>sunburst, </i>and <i>animal shapes</i>
 (which seemed a little too weak for a 9th-level spell, given that he 
was planning to apply the same jungle-creatures-only restriction as for 
the <i>summon nature's ally</i> spells). </p>
<p align="LEFT">In the end, the Jungle domain has four plant- or 
wood-related spells, three creature-summoning spells, and two others: a 
pretty balanced assortment, but not a world-beater, so we'll stick with 
our full list of granted powers. You can't fit in everything, but it's a
 good representation, and they all fit the theme. Eddie would really 
have liked to include some sort of a mist or rain/monsoon-type spell, 
but he couldn't find anything that seemed to fit (except maybe <i>control weather</i>, but that was just too general). Still, he could have gotten really clever and assigned <i>sleet storm</i> as a 3rd-level domain spell. . .</p>
<p align="LEFT">WHAT? <i>Sleet storm</i>, for the Jungle domain? It 
might sound nonsensical given the theme, but if you read between the 
lines (and read the next column!) you'd be surprised what can be brought
 out with a little creativity. </p>
