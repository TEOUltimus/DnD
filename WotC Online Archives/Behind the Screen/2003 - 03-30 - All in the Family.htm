 campaigns. In examining the close personal relationships in which 
characters may become involved, it stands to reason that we should also 
think about the relationships within which the player character came to 
exist. These can include his or her heritage, religion, culture, and 
community--the social building blocks from which the person's identity 
is constructed--but in the most immediate sense it means family. Who 
were the character's parents? Where are they now? What about the rest of
 the character's family? Is there something within the family history 
that led to the character choosing a particular career path?</span></p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many
 of the same concerns that apply to love relationships apply here, 
especially in terms of in-game effects. Family members are in many ways a
 liability for an adventurer. They are a vulnerable spot, where enemies 
who know about them can strike at the character to make him or her 
suffer. Family members are plot devices waiting to happen. You and your 
players have seen movies and read books by the truckload in which some 
relative or close acquaintance is waylaid by the bad guys, or converts 
to evil and betrays the hero, and so on.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Often,
 players prefer to avoid such unpleasant--and often 
contrived--situations and for that reason minimize the whole issue of 
family in the adventure game. You could argue that a PC with no family 
is equally contrived, but that fact is easy enough to ignore by simply 
focusing on the here and now of the PCs' adventures, keeping the 
spotlight on them. A game can work perfectly well without dealing with 
family background and such issues at all. This is particularly true if 
the players and DM are more interested in the mechanics of the game and 
the characters than in crafting a personality and history for the 
characters. Different people play <b>D&amp;D</b> for different reasons 
and get enjoyment out of different facets of the game, and if you and 
your players are not especially interested in drafting a personal 
dossier for the characters who will populate the campaign, then nothing 
further needs to be done. Family is a non-issue. For those who seek more
 depth of character in their campaigns, however, this column is directed
 at you.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once you have decided to include character families as an element of the campaign, you must <b>decide how you will determine family background for the characters. </b>The
 simplest answer is to just make it up. This process should be a 
collaborative effort between each player and the DM, which will help 
avoid either party being suddenly surprised with a background he or she 
considers unacceptable. The creation process need not be a 50/50 
collaboration, and in fact might be done almost entirely by one person 
or the other, but both the DM and the player should have a final say 
over the character's background. As a DM, you should encourage a player 
to think about the character's background during character generation, 
so that the player can take it into consideration when selecting feats 
and (especially) skills. A character whose parents were farmers, for 
instance, might have a few ranks of Profession (farmer) or Handle 
Animal, while an orphan taken in by an order of monks under a vow of 
silence might learn Innuendo and Sense Motive, but would be unlikely to 
learn Speak Language. These are not requirements per se, but rather an 
attempt to model the character's background within the mechanics of the 
game.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some
 DMs may feel that open-ended free choice in a character's background is
 too vulnerable to abuse by players. ("Hmmm . . . I guess I'll be the 
second son of aged King Harnott, and the first son is the black sheep of
 the family who is forbidden by law to inherit. Plus, I've always been 
mother's favorite son. I RULE!") It also might lead to significant 
incongruities between the player's idea of the campaign world and the 
DM's idea. Since players have only incomplete knowledge of what is going
 on, they may create a story that does not easily translate into the 
politics, geography, or social structure of the campaign 
world--requiring a lot of revising on the DM's part to translate the 
essential elements of the player's background story into something that 
fits.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 might also find that neither player nor DM has a clear idea of what a 
character's family background should be. In this case, the DM might 
generate a family background randomly, perhaps with tables like those in
 the 1st Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Unearthed Arcana</i> and <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 rulebooks. In such a system, you randomly determine the parents' social
 class, profession, and marital status, birth order and total number of 
children, and whether relatives are living or dead. You might also 
consult other game systems, or supplements that are not specific to any 
particular game system (e.g., <i>Central Casting</i>). You can be as 
detailed as you wish in such generation, but you must beware of systems 
that will cause complications for the player's choice of character. 
Random generation systems for parentage and background are most useful 
as idea generators; they can inspire and elaborate a character's 
background, but should not be its sole determinant. Ultimately, the 
background should support the kind of character the player wishes to 
play. If the system you propose to use might invalidate the player's 
chosen character concept (for example, by sticking him or her with 
parents of the wrong social class or profession to qualify for a given 
character choice), then the DM and player should work together to 
"massage" the random die rolls into a result that allows the player to 
have a character he or she wants to play.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Keep
 an open mind to ideas suggested by your players as something of 
particular relevance to their characters, as you might find some good 
adventure hooks there</b>--ideas spawned from the texture of the 
individual characters and therefore with built-in resonance or appeal as
 something that character (and presumably the player) would like to do. 
Whatever the scenario, it can now be played through with the added 
texture of involving someone related to the PC. However, be careful of 
overdoing the importance of the family in character background (e.g., a 
search for a long-lost mother) if you have no intention of shaping the 
campaign to include that character goal. Avoid dumping a pile of 
meaningless detail on a character. There is only so much information 
most players need or want to know about their character, especially if 
you run a highly lethal campaign. Why do a lot of background work for a 
character who might not last all that long? Decide what is important to 
the campaign and what is not. Emphasize the points that are relevant, 
and fill in the "flavor text" of the character's background as you feel 
the need or find the opportunity. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>A
 character should know the names of his or her parents, where they are 
from, what they do for a living, and their present status and condition.</b>
 Are they dead or alive? What is the PC's relationship with them? Do 
they live near the area where the PC will be adventuring? How often do 
they visit the PC (or vice versa)? Do they ever appear "on stage," or 
are they purely background figures mentioned in passing when the PCs 
take time off from adventuring? The same basic rule applies to siblings,
 though this depends on the number of people. A character with just one 
sibling should probably know the same sorts of information as noted for 
parents, but if there are 15 brothers and sisters you don't need to 
create statistic blocks for every one of them. Extended family--uncles, 
aunts, cousins, grandparents, and so on--usually fall into the "deal 
with them as you need to or want to" bin. You can even extend 
relationships more transitively, to people who are not related to the 
character at all, but who know (or know of) the character or are known 
to them by association with relatives. ("Ah yes, your Aunt Nennia was my
 best customer!")</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To
 the extent you deal with the PC's relatives, you should think at least a
 little about who they are as people apart from the PC. Beyond the 
direct "onstage" interactions between family members and PCs, <b>significant familial NPCs should have some personality of their own.</b>
 You can invent personality traits for family members or generate them 
randomly, much as you would with a PC. (See Table 5-5: One Hundred 
Traits in Chapter 5 of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11551">Dungeon Master's Guide</a></i> as a source of ideas, or use tables and charts from a previous edition of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 or another game. The rule system doesn't really matter, since quirks, 
attitudes, and personality are rarely system-specific.) The 
personalities of NPC family members are important because you must 
establish <i>why</i> their connection with PCs is the way that it is. 
For example, just being brothers is not enough to explain a close bond 
between the PC and another character--Cain and Abel were brothers, and 
look how that turned out! You must establish the basis for the 
relationship, including the personalities of the people involved, for it
 to be credible. You don't need encyclopedic detail; like a lot of 
things in crafting the texture of your game world, a little effort goes a
 long way.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>The important aspects of familial NPCs are those that directly influence the PC in some way. </b>Perhaps
 a female cleric PC was driven to her present calling after seeing her 
younger sister seduced by dark sorcerous powers. The PC has striven for a
 life of personal purity, to ensure she would never be taken in by such 
influences, but also seeks redemption for others who have fallen to 
temptation. She may see her parents as failures and fools, blinded by 
their love for their younger daughter and not protecting her from the 
dark forces out in the world. Or she may believe that her parents' 
mysterious "boating accident" was no accident at all, that her darkling 
sister was secretly responsible, and has sworn vengeance on their 
parents' graves. Familial pathos can be a powerful motivating force and 
can enrich a background or an adventure. Likewise, a pattern of benign 
family history and in-game interactions (which should be the case most 
of the time) makes it that much more dramatic if something tragic does 
occur.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An
 adventuring PC's career can pose a threat to any NPC loved ones, but as
 a DM you should avoid inflicting tragedies upon a PC's family simply 
because it's easy to do so. Such things <i>might</i> happen, but they 
certainly should not be an automatic occurrence. In fact, contrary to 
the idea that it is realistic for a PC's family to suffer threats from 
enemies of the PC's, it is patently <i>un</i>realistic if the only 
impact of a PC's adventuring career is to bring death and danger down 
upon the heads of those he or she loves. Consider the approbation a 
family might receive as a result of their connection to a well-known 
and/or wealthy adventuring hero. PCs with family might, in fact, choose 
to apply some of their earnings toward the care and support of family 
members, or use part of their fortunes to enrich or improve the standing
 of the communities where they grew up. An orphaned PC might adopt an 
orphaned child, or establish an orphanage to care for many children in a
 similar situation to the one she found herself in long ago. In a 
campaign that makes use of rules for a PC's reputation, fame, and honor 
(such as those found in <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/wheeloftime/">The </a></b></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/wheeloftime/"><i><b>Wheel of Time</b> Roleplaying Game </i></a>,</span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> 1st Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Oriental Adventures</i> [and to a lesser extent the current <b>D&amp;D</b><i>Oriental Adventures</i>], or the 2nd Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Complete Bard's Handbook</i>), the DM should <b>consider
 what effect the reflected glory of PC might have upon their families, 
or what blot on family honor an infamous PC might impose.</b> The family
 could stand to gain prestige and perhaps wealth (through increased 
business) due to their connection with a famous personage like a 
successful PC, or it might be ruined by the whispering campaign about 
what a no-account child did.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 you are going to address a character's family issues in the campaign at
 all, deal first of all with the immediate family who helped form the 
PC's career path. Establish how (or whether) these relatives and the 
character get along and why. From there, you can slowly build the 
details of other family connections as necessary to suit the growth of 
the campaign and the integration of the PCs within it. As their fortunes
 and reputation rise and fall, so too will those of their families, 
forming one more strand in the pattern that ties the characters into the
 ongoing tapestry of the game world around them.</span></p>
