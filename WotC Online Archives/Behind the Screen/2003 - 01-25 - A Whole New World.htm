<p align="left">Where are they? Presumably the party has gone through a gate of some sort. Eddie, being the devious DM that he is, <i>might</i>
 make the whole "gate" (and what lies beyond) an elaborate illusion! But
 let's say it's real. What happens now? For Mikko, Arphaxad, Rashean, 
and Melantha, the first order of business is to find out where they are.
 They could be anywhere, anywhen, from elsewhere in the same dungeon to 
another world entirely, or maybe another plane like the metallic cubes 
of Acheron. Only the DM knows for sure. . . . </p>
<p align="left">As it turns out, the characters have eloped beyond the realms of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 into another game world. Eddie, bless his nostalgic soul, has fond 
memories of his days playing games like Gamma World, Traveler, and Star 
Frontiers (and <b>AD&amp;D </b>adventures like <i>Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, Tale of the Comet</i>, and even "City Beyond the Gate" in <i>Dragon </i>#100). He thought it might be great fun to drop the party from his <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign into a whole new postapocalyptic sci-fi world!</p>
<p align="left">If you feel similarly inspired to attempt world-crossing
 with your gaming group, there are different ways to go about it but 
they all take some work. You could create an adventure with the <i>flavor</i> of postapocalyptic sci-fi, maybe using oddball <b>D&amp;D</b>
 monsters that have a creepy/alien/mutant feel to them. If you want to 
get ambitious, you could convert monsters, items, or adventures from 
other games into <b>D&amp;D</b> stats. For some things, conversion might be easier using the <b>d20 Modern</b> rules, which are better set up for technological items. The rules for <b>D&amp;D</b> and <b>d20 Modern</b>
 are not exactly the same, but close enough that they can work together.
 If you get lucky, you might find game statistics that have already been
 converted by someone else, whether that means a fan website with a few 
favorites or a full-scale, professionally published d20 system 
conversion (like <i><b>Star Wars</b></i>).</p>
<p align="left">Eddie had some time and decided to do it himself, using <b>d20 Modern</b>
 as a guide. He had a lot of fun going through the old books and cooked 
up an adventure arc for the PCs involving one of their old adversaries, 
who discovered the gate before them. The villain made deals with the 
evil spacefaring worms on the far side of the gate, setting up an 
intergalactic trade of zombie slaves and mind-control magic for 
priceless metals and technological terror! Eddie dropped in a little 
radiation hazard, some deranged mutants, a little trip into space, and 
of course a classic wands-versus-blasters shootout! </p>
<p align="left">Sound interesting? Eddie has built up enough trust with 
his players for them to cut him some slack if he brings up an oddball 
idea. They also like sci-fi games on occasion, so the diversion is not 
going off in a direction no one but Eddie is apt to enjoy. He knows his 
players, and so should you, including the limits of their tolerance. 
Ally, Samantha, David, and Michael aren't going to be too happy if the 
campaign shifts permanently to the spaceways -- after all, they are 
playing <b>D&amp;D</b> and not a sci-fi game for a reason! -- but for the duration of a story arc, they can go with the flow.</p>
<p align="left">The most important questions to answer are: How do the 
PCs get to the new world? Why are they there? And how do they get back? 
Eddie has laid the bait and set up the adventure, setting the stage for 
the party to explore the new world and learn some of its strange 
mysteries before eventually discovering their <b>D&amp;D</b>-world enemy
 plotting with the alien mutant menace. Once that happens, the party can
 bust up the conspiracy and seal the gateway to this freak-infested 
universe to forestall any future alien invasions. The mission has a 
clear and attainable end-goal, though PCs should still have the 
opportunity to "sightsee" a bit before they return home.</p>
<p align="left">The mechanics of cross-genre gaming are important, 
because they can have a big effect on how much fun a player has. If all 
of a sudden the characters' deities are hard or impossible to reach, 
Melantha is going to be pretty hosed and Ally not very happy. Likewise, 
if technological traps and such are impossibly tough for a <b>D&amp;D</b>
 rogue to do anything with, or if the party gets to fight only robot 
constructs immune to crits (and sneak attacks), Mikko is going to suffer
 a major reduction in effectiveness and Michael is going to howl loud 
and long. Even communication is a major issue: Can the party talk to the
 people in the new world? How will NPCs from the new world react to 
alien/foreign PCs?</p>
<p align="left">In combat, are the party's weapons, armor, and spells 
going to be effective in the new world? It's okay if they work a little 
differently here (for example, some enemies might have DR/energy 
weapons, high-tech weapons might bypass some or all of a character's 
armor bonus, technological items could require Exotic Weapon Proficiency
 for PCs), but be wary of massively handicapping characters or imposing a
 style that is radically unsuited to the characters in <i>your</i> PC party.</p>
<p align="left">Once you open the doorway between worlds, you also have 
to decide what happens to stuff brought from one side to another. Do 
technological gadgets still function in a magical world, and vice versa?
 Is it just a matter of limited (and presumably nonreplaceable) charges?
 Can technological items be replicated with magic (or vice versa)? Say 
Mikko gets killed (again) over in the alien world; could Michael bring 
in a new mutant or alien character?</p>
<p align="left">Maybe the biggest question of all is whether to let PCs 
go back and forth between worlds more than once. Usually it's best to 
answer no, even making destruction of the gateway a necessary part of 
the adventure. Things can get out of hand if you have a clever player 
like Samantha dreaming of all the ways she can manipulate the gateway 
for fun and profit, and limits on cross-world items may prove moot if 
it's possible to go through the gateway to resupply. It might work, but 
consider carefully the long-term campaign impact if the worlds are 
permanently joined and decide whether that's how you want the world to 
evolve.</p>
<p align="left">Although Eddie is doing a sci-fi crossover, the same 
principles apply when going to any new plane of existence or even other 
D&amp;D campaign settings, whether an alternate "standard" 
(pseudo-medieval Europe-ish) <b>D&amp;D</b> world like Krynn (<b>Dragonlance</b>) or a more exotic setting like Rokugan (<i>Oriental Adventures</i>), Zakhara (<i>Al-Qadim</i>), or Athas (<b>Dark Sun</b>). It's more complicated when you go beyond the borders of <b>D&amp;D</b>, whether into other fantasy like <b>Wheel of Time</b> or sci-fi like <i>Star Wars</i>
 or anything else you can imagine. But if you have the time and the 
inclination, a cross-world adventure can be a lot of fun. Maybe your PCs
 will team up with some <b>Marvel</b> superheroes, like mine did many years ago, and have a darned good time doing it!</p>
