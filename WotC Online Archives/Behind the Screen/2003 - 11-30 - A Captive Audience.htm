</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A captivity scenario brings some special considerations 
along with it. As David's situation illustrates, taking prisoners is 
hard to pull off without ruining someone's fun. Roleplaying games aren't
 like books or movies, where the action keeps moving while some 
characters are captives. In a game with people running the characters, a
 PC becoming a prisoner usually interrupts whatever else is happening, 
taking precedence over other party goals unless there are unusual 
circumstances. David is basically out of action for the immediate 
future, unless the DM wants to play out Rashean's interactions with his 
captors, or perhaps let David run a party NPC. In any case, the party is
 now split, and either David can sit and twiddle his thumbs while the 
rest of the party does stuff, or else he roleplays the captivity while 
everyone else sits around and waits.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unless the whole party gets nabbed, a prisoner PC means 
you have to deal with a split group of characters. You might even have 
to physically split up the <i>players</i> as well, so David can't make 
escape plans based on what the rest of the party does -- information 
that Rashean Bantecou doesn't have. If you keep the players together, 
they can try not to use out-of-character knowledge overheard from the 
other group, but it can spoil the atmosphere of uncertainty and 
desperation that you ideally want when PCs are captured. So if you're 
writing imprisonment into your adventure, give advance thought to how 
you want to handle the resulting split focus it creates around the game 
table.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond group dynamics, however, DMs should carefully 
consider the events leading up to imprisonment. First of all, who gets 
captured? One member of the party? Multiple members? Everyone? And how 
will allied NPCs react to their own captivity, or respond to the 
captivity of party members if they themselves remain free?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Second, how are the PCs captured? Classic <b>D&amp;D</b> prisoner adventures like the <i>Slavers</i>
 series were designed as one-shot tournament adventures where you expect
 things to happen for no other reason than that they are "in the 
module." The party is drugged, gassed, ensorcelled, surrounded by 
enemies, or overcome by some other unavoidable whammy that leaves them 
at the villains' mercy. They get captured, and they just have to suck it
 up and deal. In an ongoing campaign, however, such DM fiats are more 
objectionable. They may work once in a blue moon, but in most cases the 
players should feel they had a chance and a choice, that you were not 
just railroading them. Use nonlethal damage, paralysis, poison, special 
tactics like bull rushes, disarms, or grapples, or even simple 
intimidation by enemies to get the party to submit.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Third, why? Why capture enemies instead of killing them 
-- usually the more expedient course? Some reasons an antagonist might 
take prisoners include:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Information.</b> Maybe Rashean's bandit captors 
secretly work for the evil sorcerer Hazar-Enan, and he wants to know why
 they wandered so close to his evil ninja training camp. Capturing 
someone to obtain information works especially well if the PCs are 
involved in an ongoing hit-and-run operation, as in a supermodule like <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882370000">Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil</a></i>.
 The villains want to learn about the adventurers who have been a thorn 
in their side. So they capture a party member to interrogate or torture 
for information about the group's strengths, weaknesses, allies, safe 
havens, or future plans. The captive might be kept indefinitely, 
tortured and/or killed, turned to the side of evil (by magical control, 
possession, or even simple bribery), or even replaced with a 
shapeshifter. If the entire party is captured, the PCs may be completely
 separated, held in a common area and taken off separately for 
questioning, or interrogated as a group.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Plot Device.</b> Perhaps Rashean is the last 
descendant of an ancient bloodline and Hazar-Enan wants to use him to 
gain access to the family's magically sealed treasure vault containing 
the dreaded Eye of Ezion-Geber. In short, "We need you alive for [insert
 plot reason]." The prisoners might eventually be killed, but right now 
the villains need them alive for some nefarious scheme. Its nature might
 be a mystery, or the Evil Overlord may laugh maniacally and taunt them 
with the entire Diabolical Plot, knowing they could <i>never</i> escape the Slow-Moving and Easily Avoidable Death Trap.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ransom (or slavery).</b> Maybe the bandits decided to
 bag Rashean just to see what they could get for him, either from his 
rich friends or in the slave-markets of Rimmon. Use of ransom as a 
motive for taking prisoners requires a certain common understanding of 
honor, battlefield etiquette, and trustworthiness within the world of 
the campaign. If it is expected that prisoners can be ransomed, battles 
will often stop short of killing, as surrender is an accepted part of 
battle rather than a suicide pact. A combatant may yield with the 
expectation of being able to ransom herself and her possessions 
according to reasonable and accepted standards.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The opponents aren't really enemies.</b> Maybe 
Rashean's "bandits" were actually bounty hunters trying to haul him back
 to Duke Makir of Kadesh to stand trial for his sale of a fake magic 
item to the duke.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs might be in trouble with the law in a generally 
good society where the authorities try to capture lawbreakers and bring 
them to trial for their crimes (real or imagined) rather than kill them 
immediately. The PCs' legal troubles might be legitimate, or could 
result from the influence of a secret villain (vampire, doppelganger, 
evil vizier, etc.) manipulating the law enforcement people in the area.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A final question about being captured is, what happens 
to the prisoners' belongings? If ransom is sought, does accepted 
practice within the campaign world allow captors the right to keep 
anything, or must it all be ransomed along with the hostage? Can they 
hold particular items back or declare them spoils of war? Setting ransom
 issues aside, do prisoners have access to anything that can help them 
make their escape? <i>In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords</i> begins with
 the characters stripped naked, but you don't have to go that far. You 
do have to decide what can be recovered; some items may be taken or sold
 and hard to get back. Other stuff may be stored in the closet right 
next to the character's jail cell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are a hundred other details involved in taking 
prisoners, including how closely they are guarded, how friendly the 
guards are, how talkative their captors are about why the capture was 
made, how difficult the captive's bonds (or cell doors, or whatever) are
 to escape, the consequences of failed escape attempts, and even whether
 all captives will be treated alike. A prisoner scenario is difficult to
 do well, but it adds a different feel to the gaming session and can be 
an exhilarating experience for the players -- with a sense of real 
danger for their characters that they don't always feel when it's <i>only</i> a matter of life and death.</p>
