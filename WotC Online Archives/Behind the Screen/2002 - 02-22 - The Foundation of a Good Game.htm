<p align="center"><b>Quick Hints for DMs</b></p>
<p class="size2">To run a game effectively, remember these key points:</p>
<p class="size2">1. Know your players: Ask what they like to play, what 
characters they want to bring to the table, how they like to play, what 
goals they have in mind for their characters, and so on! Players play 
differently and want different things, and you can integrate each 
player's strengths, wants, and playing style into the game, but you have
 to know what the strengths, wants, and styles are first!</p>
<p class="size2">2. The DM is a player, too: The DM has some say over 
how the game goes since he or she is creating it. At the same time, 
though, the DM needs to remember that the other players have their own 
roles in creating the game.</p>
<p class="size2">3. The game is supposed to be fun: If the game isn't fun, figure out why it isn't. Then fix it. (See point 4 below.)</p>
<p class="size2">4. Talk to your players: Before the campaign begins, 
talk to your players (as in point 1). During the game, check back with 
your players and see if the game is going the way they expect. If not, 
address those points as a group. If it's running well, then congratulate
 yourself and try to maintain that group goodness! Also, if you sense 
things aren't quite right, or if conflict arises, immediately start 
talking to your players to figure out what's going on and how to fix it.</p>
<p class="size2">5. Step away from the screen (optional): Sometimes it's
 good to take a break from running the game and see the other side of 
the screen. You might pick up some good ideas for handling situations 
for your own game that way!</p>
<p class="size2">6. Watch how your players interact with the game and 
with each other: Sometimes people don't bring up problems. Watch for 
tension or discomfort and try to discuss it so that a solution for it 
can be found. Also, know when to call for breaks, when to call for 
focus, and when to end the session, and then do so.</p>

<p class="size2">Advice to the Dungeon Master (DM) is a matter of 
stylistic taste, and what may be great advice for one Dungeon Master may
 not give much help to another. This advice can come in different forms:
 logistical, procedural, content-oriented, and interpersonal. Logistical
 concerns include how to set up the physical environment in which the 
players will play. Procedural advice covers things like how to 
orchestrate game play, how to give evocative descriptions, and how to 
manage combat. Content-oriented recommendations incorporate things like 
how to structure the in-game aspects of the world and its inhabitants, 
and it deals with the opportunities or paths that player characters 
(PCs) can take. Finally, interpersonal advice includes how to deal with 
players as people on an individual and group basis. I will address the 
latter issue, the interpersonal dynamics of gaming and how you can use 
them to become a better Dungeon Master, in part one of the Behind the 
Screen series of articles.</p>
<p class="size2">The mantra that allows you, the DM, to address the 
other issues around your game and make it enjoyable for everyone 
involved is deceptively simple and easily overlooked: <b>Know your players</b>.
 Know what they play and why. Know what they enjoy and where they excel.
 Know the kinds of goals and preferences they have for their 
character(s) and this campaign. Know their motivations in playing an RPG
 in the first place. You don't have to draw up a dossier on all current 
and prospective players, though some gaming groups ask a new player 
about his or her gaming habits so that they can know what to expect. 
Simply put, you should know where your players are coming from and what 
they are looking for so that you know what to emphasize when setting up 
the campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">Additionally, don't forget that <b>the Dungeon Master is a player, too! </b>Roleplaying
 games (RPGs) are a cooperative activity, and the DM is one of the 
people involved in that cooperation. Though DMs roleplay the adversaries
 of the PCs, running a game is not an adversarial activity. The Dungeon 
Master's goal is not to "win" any more than the players' goal is to 
"win" -- the goal of both is to create a mutually enjoyable experience.</p>
<p class="size2">With all the fuss over roleplaying, don't forget the "G" in RPG, either: <b>game</b>.
 A game is something people play for fun; if the game is no fun, then 
what's the point? For most people, a game where one person holds all the
 cards is no fun. There must be some give-and-take, or a sense of a 
negotiated settlement that includes the input of anyone who cares to 
give input. Does that mean every idea is accepted as a matter of course?
 No way. It does mean, however, that all input receives a fair hearing, 
that players can air their grievances (if any), and that DMs can 
consider ideas for changes.</p>
<p class="size2">The DM is <i><b>one</b></i> of the players in this 
game. His or her enjoyment or input is not automatically any more or 
less important than any other player's. As part of the negotiated 
settlement (however tacit and informal it may be) between the DM and the
 other players, the DM receives a degree of formal in-game powers and a 
default level of discretion from the players in exchange for being the 
person in charge of creating and managing the game world and game 
mechanics. The DM decides what the world is like, where the PCs begin 
their careers, what knowledge they have of the world around them, and 
what opportunities the players can seek out. The DM must make clear to 
the players any options open to them. Players carry expectations and 
must learn of any deviations from them if they are to make informed 
decisions. Do rangers in the DM's campaign have archery-related feats 
instead of dual-weapon feats? Are half-ogres an allowable PC race? Is 
there a "Common" tongue? Is the campaign set in a pseudo-European 
medieval setting or something more exotic? Is it mostly dungeoneering? 
Or is it wilderness-oriented or city-based? The players grant to the DM 
the discretion to make these kinds of decisions, but if the decisions 
depart too radically from the players' expectations, some friction may 
develop.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Questions to Ask Your Players Before You Begin</b></p>
<p class="size2">Here are some questions to ask your players before you begin playing. Keep in mind that you should feel free to add in <i>your</i>
 answers to these questions as you go. It's not fun for anyone if you 
end up running something you hate! Also, you can skip whatever questions
 are a given. For example, if you all wanted to talk about a <i>Star Wars</i>
 campaign, you've already figured out the genre and actual setting, but 
not necessarily the setting's era! Finally, you don't have to read off 
all of these questions like a checklist, and you can add in your own 
specific questions. This list of questions is here to invite 
conversation and comments about the campaign you want to start. If a 
conversation is going a bit off of the path you thought it would, but is
 still relevant, let it go that way until it is no longer relevant to 
you, then gently but firmly steer it back on track with another 
question.</p>
<p class="size2">1. What genre of campaign do you want to play?</p>
<p class="size2">2. What setting in that genre do you want to play? 
(This could also resolve which rules you want to play with, but see 
question 7.)</p>
<p class="size2">3. What time period or era do you wish to play in?</p>
<p class="size2">4. What type of campaign do you want to play? 
(Examples: wilderness, city-based, political/intrigue, hack-and-slash, 
dungeon-based, mixture, and so on)</p>
<p class="size2">5. What types of characters does each player want to 
play? (You can talk generally at first, but be sure to emphasize that a 
player should bring a character he or she feels comfortable playing and 
not feel <i>forced</i> to play that cleric simply because the group has no healer.)</p>
<p class="size2">6. What are the goals of your characters?</p>
<p class="size2">7. What home rules or optional rules do you want to 
allow or forbid? (Also, bring up any other unusual campaign-based things
 here, such as you don't have elves in your campaign.)</p>
<p class="size2">8. Do you like lots of battles and combat, or do you 
prefer to solve puzzles, or do you like to learn about the people and 
the world around you? (Some people love combat. Some people love to 
roleplay with NPCs for hours. Some players love a healthy balance (and 
will tell you what "healthy" means to them). This question helps draw 
out the different types of players in your group.</p>
<p class="size2">9. Why do you roleplay? (This question can come up 
earlier, but you can also use it to resolve some lingering questions you
 have about your players and their roleplaying styles.)</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">When expectations or preferences for campaign direction
 are at odds between the player(s) and the DM, the DM and the players 
should discuss their thoughts, feelings, and ideas about the course of 
the campaign. Ideally, this should take place before the campaign begins
 so that expectations align and conflicts get resolved before the 
campaign begins. Realistically, though, these sorts of differences often
 don't develop until the campaign has started rolling along. For 
example, the DM may become frustrated if the players consistently ignore
 adventure hooks tossed in their direction or if the PCs keep running 
off into the woods instead of sacking that nice, juicy dungeon that he 
or she lovingly built. The players may get discouraged if they expected a
 combat-light campaign with a lot of NPC interaction and problem-solving
 (and built their characters to handle those situations), but they end 
up deep in a dungeon because they have choices that include only 
dungeons. Whatever the precise circumstances may be, the players 
(including the DM) may find themselves in a game different from what 
they expected. </p>
<p class="size2">So what do you do about it? The answer is as deceptively simple as the problem: <b>Talk to your players!</b>
 In discussing the game with them, you can help crystallize and clarify 
everyone's feelings about the game. You may also gain further knowledge 
of the players' wishes and playing styles. If there is a rule 
interpretation you don't like and wish to change, discuss it with your 
players. They may agree, or they may think it's just fine the way it is.
 They may also want to avoid monkeying around with the official rules. 
You might say, "I'm bored with stale old Euro-fantasy! I want to try 
running something set in ancient India, but with evil PCs!" Your players
 might say, "Sounds great! You could download the Mahasarpa campaign for
 ideas," or they might say, "Um, no . . . don't think so. I like 
Euro-fantasy." It may turn out that what you want as a DM and what the 
players want as players will not be compatible. If that's the case, the 
best thing to do is see whether someone else would like to run the game 
for a while, or you could even run simultaneous or alternating 
campaigns. For example, maybe one DM can run an <b>AD&amp;D Dark Sun</b> campaign every other week, while another runs a <b>D&amp;D Forgotten Realms</b> campaign. You might even step away from the screen for a while and let someone else start a campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">On the subject of DMs playing, another good way to gain
 insight into the way players see things is to make sure you sit on both
 sides of the screen, so to speak. Even if you run games most of the 
time, it is good for you to be on the playing end of things periodically
 so that you don't forget what it's like to not know everything ahead of
 time. You may even pick up ideas from your current DM that you can 
incorporate into your own game. Playing your own PC, with all the 
investment of time, energy, and (at least sometimes) emotion that goes 
into it, also helps bring home the fact that there are different ways to
 enjoy the game. This is a point that must be emphasized when it comes 
to knowing your players (and yourself as a subset of "players"): 
Different players enjoy different aspects of the game. </p>
<p class="size2">The DM must also possess (or develop) some facility at 
reading people and situations. Sometimes players simply do not feel 
comfortable voicing their concerns openly, and the DM should notice and 
attend to those concerns. A DM should notice when a gaming situation is 
getting out of hand and take an executive time-out to rein things in. If
 the players are getting too far off the rails with side conversations 
and incessant jokes, and if they are not really attending appropriately 
to the game, the DM should call for order and focus (or even stop the 
game for a short break to allow people some time to finish whatever 
they're talking about and come back to the game ready to play). If the 
players are getting tired, the DM should know to wrap up the current 
situation and end the gaming session. For that matter, the DM needs to 
be aware when he or she cannot run the game. If that means you need to 
take some extra time to prepare for an encounter or you're feeling logy 
around 10:30 and want to call it a night even when the rest of the 
players want to game on, the players need to respect that decision and 
even appreciate it. It will avoid short tempers and muzzy-headed 
decisions later on that can have negative consequences within the 
campaign and between players who come out on the wrong end of them.</p>
<p class="size2">Paying conscious attention to the interpersonal aspects
 of the game, both before you begin the campaign and throughout the time
 you play together, can ease a host of problems before they have a 
chance to happen. Even when problems do arise, you at least have a 
chance to address them before they fester and grow to the point of 
crippling or even killing your campaign. Before you can talk about the 
finer points of running the game itself, you have to remember the simple
 fact that this is a group of people -- of <i>friends</i> in most cases -- getting together to engage in a <b>shared</b>
 hobby. They have their own thoughts and feelings about the game and the
 participants, and taking full account of those thoughts and feelings 
sets a foundation upon which all other aspects of a good game can be 
built.</p>
