<p class="size2">One basic truth of playing <b>D&amp;D</b> or any 
roleplaying game (RPG) is that the spotlight usually remains on what the
 players are doing. In some campaigns, this can prevail to the extent 
that it seems nothing of consequence ever happens when the player 
characters (PCs) are not around, which exaggerates the importance of the
 decisions of the players (in other words, if they don't do something 
about it, they know darn well that nobody is going to do it). It also 
conveys a sense of unreality to the players, because it is hard to take 
seriously a world that is frozen in amber until you step out on stage. 
This issue has been dealt with in previous columns, and what I intend to
 discuss here is the opposite end of the spectrum -- an excessive focus 
on the action going on in places where the players and their characters 
are not involved -- and ways to think about the integration of nonplayer
 characters (NPCs) into the campaign both as elements of the background 
and world surrounding the PCs and also as elements integral to an 
adventuring party, such as cohorts and followers.</p>
<p class="size2">As always, <b>balance is the key to resolving how much to play up the NPCs in the campaign as compared to the PCs. </b>The
 presence and independent activity of NPCs makes the world vital and 
real instead of just a sterile stage for the PCs to sweep in, do their 
business, and then leave behind without a second thought. The fact that 
NPCs can react to (and sometimes anticipate) the actions of the PCs 
reinforces the point that behavior has consequences, both good and bad, 
and that the choices that NPCs make will be based on their personality 
(simply represented by alignment, plus any particular cultural, 
traditional, or even instinctual ways of seeing and behaving). It makes 
the PCs aware that their actions and reputations matter in the world (or
 at least their little corner of it), so they're not just anonymously 
hacking and looting their way to fortune.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1.<i> The focus should be on the player characters, not the NPCs.</i>
 The players are there with their characters for their own amusement, 
not just for yours. Sitting back for a one-man improv show is generally 
not as enjoyable for the players as being a part of the action or, 
better yet, right in the thick of the most important happenings.</p>
<p class="size2">2.<i> Player characters should at least be able to aspire to the power and position held by NPCs.</i>
 Whether their goal of attaining the personal or political power of any 
given NPC is realistic is not as important as the sense that, if they 
applied themselves over a long and successful career, they could rival 
the great NPCs of the world.</p>
<p class="size2">3.<i> Cohorts (and sometimes followers) can be a great addition.</i>
 It can be fun for a character to have a sidekick or a bunch of minions.
 They can also supplement weak points in a party or add extra 
capabilities that it previously lacked.</p>
<p class="size2">4.<i> Cohorts (and sometimes followers) can create problems too.</i>
 They create a power disparity within the party that makes encounters 
and challenges more difficult to balance, adds extra characters to 
manage in combat, and puts a drain on XP, treasure, and party resources.
 Discuss whether you want to allow cohorts and followers to adventure 
with the party.</p>
<p class="size2">5.<i> What is Leadership really for?</i> You may choose
 to disallow cohorts and followers from active adventuring, but it can 
still be a useful feat for PCs who aspire to social or political 
prominence or who wish to build a castle, town, or business.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">Problems can arise, however, when you spend too much 
game time describing what else is going on in the world besides what the
 party is doing. You may see this come true when the actions of the NPCs
 overshadow the achievements of the party. You may find this complaint 
often leveled against computer-based RPGs, wherein much of what the 
player can do amounts to a series of "fetch my boots" missions carried 
out at the behest of some powerful NPC personage, but the phenomenon is 
not limited to electronic games. It is perfectly reasonable for PCs to 
undertake missions on behalf of some NPC or other, but if that becomes 
the standard template of their adventures the players may begin to feel 
more like errand boys than aspiring heroes. They may question that if 
So-and-So the Magnificent is so great, why doesn't he go slay the 
iridescent puce dragon that lairs in the Caves of Chaos? He's powerful 
enough that it would be no problem, but instead he sends a party of PCs 
that are just barely powerful enough to take on the dragon and live to 
tell the tale.</p>
<p class="size2">This solution is a self-defeating one, however, because
 rather than feeling like errand boys, the party may feel like a bunch 
of irrelevant wimps where the superheroes of the game world take care of
 all of the <i>real</i> problems and they receive the two-bit get-the-kitty-out-of-the-tree missions. Fairly or unfairly, the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 campaign setting has this reputation in gaming circles, as one where 
the key NPCs are the most powerful characters in the world and always 
will be. This may be due to misuse of powerful NPCs as <i>deus ex machina</i>,
 where they would ride in and save the ostensible heroes (in other 
words, the PCs) in their darkest hour, like the cavalry riding in to 
save the beleaguered settlers in an old western. While this might be 
okay to do <i>once</i>, especially if the party was already seeking out 
the NPC in question and were actively engaged in a foil-the-evil-plot 
activity, to have the campaign superheroes pop up and save the party for
 something other than as a plot device in the ongoing story arc of the 
campaign makes the players feel impotent and frustrated. This is 
especially true if the players get the sense that these super-NPCs will <i>always</i>
 be more powerful than they are, that they can never approach the NPCs' 
degrees of power or importance in the world, and that they will never 
have a real opportunity to become more than a second-rate hero.</p>
<p class="size2">However, one shouldn't say that such characters cannot 
and should not ever be used. Instead, it can be kind of fun for players 
to encounter a "celebrity" of the game world, especially for players who
 have read novels featuring those characters or if they are simply fans 
of the game world. It can be fun for you, as well, and it strengthens 
the tie of the PCs to the fabric of the game world, because those famous
 personages are a part of what makes the world unique and special. <b>The
 key is to use powerful NPCs in situations where they can be allies or 
resources but without making the players feel that their characters are 
merely the henchmen of the more powerful NPC.</b> The PCs don't have to 
be as powerful as the super-NPC, and the power gap can be quite 
significant, but they must feel as though their contribution is 
important and useful in whatever they are doing together. Without this 
sense, the players are likely to very quickly become bored, frustrated, 
or both. The fun wears off quickly if you always have to be Robin to 
someone else's Batman, or Jim to their Marlin Perkins (gratuitous 
reference inserted for fans of Mutual of Omaha's <i>Wild Kingdom</i> from the seventies). Use super-NPCs like a strong seasoning; a little goes a long way.</p>
<p class="size2">On the other hand, <b>some players might like a turn at being on the other end of the hero-sidekick relationship</b>. To this end, <b>D&amp;D</b>
 offers the Leadership feat, which entitles the player who selects it to
 attract a cohort and/or a number of low-level followers. The 
construction of this within the rules as a feat ensures that only those 
players who have some interest in amassing a body of minions need to 
worry about it; those who don't care for that style of play needn't 
bother with it. It also becomes a part of the tradeoffs in constructing a
 character: Attract a cohort, and you have an assistant whose first 
loyalty is to you and can watch your back in situations where other 
party members might not be willing or able to; forego Leadership, and 
you get an extra feat of your choice. Game-mechanically speaking, a 
cohort can also fill in a missing link or supplement a weak area in your
 (or your party's) arsenal of capabilities, whether that void is in 
spellcasting, fighting prowess, rogue skills, or whatever. Cohorts that 
are rare and exotic creatures (including mounts) can also be just as 
much fun as typical classed humanoid cohorts and offer many of the same 
types of extra capabilities to the party.</p>
<p class="size2">Cohorts do create a problem for the party, however, in that <b>they also create a drain on party resources.</b>
 They are almost always several levels behind the party average, but 
they need to eat, they require healing, and they are usually killed more
 easily and require raising or resurrection. They also count as a party 
member for the purpose of determining experience points, and they 
usually are entitled to at least some share of treasure found during 
adventuring. While this may not be a full share of treasure, other 
players may resent having to grant any shares to a lower-level character
 who joined the party without their input, whose primary loyalty is not 
to the party as a whole, and who in a sense could be considered an 
employee of another character. They might suggest that if the character 
in question wants a cohort, then they should pay the cohort a salary 
from her own funds without penalizing the rest of the group for that 
choice. Most groups would not make such draconian demands of PCs who 
take a cohort, but sometimes issues such as these should be addressed 
before any characters take the Leadership feat and introduces a cohort 
to the party.</p>
<p class="size2">Over and above any objections raised by players, 
cohorts can be a problem for you, the DM. First and foremost, they 
create the potential for a power struggle over who controls the 
character. As an NPC, the cohort technically remains under your control,
 though in most cases you may simply allow the player to run the 
character as a secondary character. The classic warnings against 
allowing a player to run more than one character are muted by the fact 
that the cohort is not a full-fledged character but is an intensely 
loyal follower of the PC and likely to take his or her instructions in 
the most favorable way. If you feel it important, however, you might 
have to overrule a player's preference for what the cohort should do, 
and that kind of situation may create at least a bit of hard feeling.</p>
<p class="size2">In addition, adding extra characters to the party can 
be a problem in combat situations, especially if the group is large. The
 use of cyclic ordinal initiative in <b>D&amp;D</b> makes this problem a bit easier to deal with than in previous editions of <b>D&amp;D,</b>
 but one more player on the battlefield (or more than one, if several 
player characters have selected Leadership or have taken it more than 
once) can add a significant headache both in terms of keeping track of 
that character and what he or she is doing and in figuring out what that
 character adds to the preparatory abilities of the party. Does that 
character have special skills or magical/psionic capabilities (for 
example, a <i>wand of haste</i> or <i>fly</i>, or high Search and 
Disable Device skills) that alter the way the party can approach the 
challenges you place before them, whether in combat or otherwise. 
Cohorts make it more difficult to balance encounters and challenges for 
the party, particularly with creatures capable of using area-effect 
attacks. The player characters may easily withstand (or at least 
survive) attacks that wipe the cohort(s) off the board with little or no
 chance of survival since cohorts usually have fewer hit points, magic 
items, or spells in effect on them, and they are less likely to succeed 
in saving throws or (for the most part) skill or ability checks. The DM 
can just say "tough luck" to the player(s) with the cohort(s), but 
that's cold comfort to someone who invested a feat slot as well as time,
 effort, and probably treasure in building up their cohort. On the other
 hand, challenges that do not wipe out the cohorts might be too easy for
 the player characters, and trying to balance everything out is a dicey 
proposition at best. All of the above problems apply but in even greater
 degree when a player with Leadership wants to make use of his or her 
followers, who are far too weak to be taken on most adventuring 
situations, and even if they were they would constitute an enormous 
headache in combat logistics for the DM and players alike.</p>
<p class="size2">The problem of power disparity applies equally to any 
party in which you find a significant variation in levels on an ongoing 
basis (it is less important in one-shot or specific scenarios, such as 
the super-NPC working with a less-powerful party mentioned above), and 
it makes things harder on you to keep everyone satisfied. You may find 
it reasonable to state that you are not comfortable having to deal with 
the complications of cohorts, either in the clutter of day-to-day action
 (especially combat) or in creating and balancing the challenges within 
the campaign, and simply rule out the use of the feat on that basis. 
This may disappoint those who had aspirations of taking the feat, but it
 should prevent a lot of argument later on.</p>
<p class="size2">Even if you and the players do not want to deal with 
cohorts and followers on an ongoing basis, you could talk about allowing
 the feat to those who aspire to feudal lordship or some such similar 
position, in a campaign scenario where they have enough free time to 
pursue long-term goals of this type. Although in certain game situations
 the ability to rally followers (or a cohort who does not adventure with
 the character) may not be a benefit, <b>attracting a seed cluster of low-level NPCs can certainly be useful in terms of staffing and guarding</b>
 a castle, a large business enterprise (perhaps a trading ship), a 
cathedral, or even a small town, and the number is probably sufficient 
to serve this need. Should a character desire something made by her 
craftspeople or want an honor guard for a state visit (or to guard a 
trade caravan), those kinds of services are available on demand. In this
 use of Leadership, the cohort serves as the steward and representative 
for the player character and governs her affairs while the PC is off 
adventuring. Although the followers granted by Leadership number too few
 to constitute any sort of army (unless the character is very high in 
level, and at that level the PC could probably take on the same 
challenges as her small army with at least as good a chance at victory),
 they are ample to police a small domain that will progressively expand 
as the PC gains levels or fulfills special conditions to boost her 
Leadership score, in addition to growth that may be due to other 
settlers who elect to move into the PC's domain even though they are not
 technically loyal followers. Is all that worth a feat slot? That 
depends on the player, but for some it might be, and it's probably worth
 keeping Leadership as a feat even if you decide not to allow active 
play of cohorts or followers on adventuring missions. It can be fun to 
meet famous NPCs, but it can be even more fun to make yourself into a 
famous PC and have the NPCs be excited to meet you and join your legion 
of lickspittles, toadies, and yes-men, or just to be loyal and faithful 
followers of your mighty banner.</p>
