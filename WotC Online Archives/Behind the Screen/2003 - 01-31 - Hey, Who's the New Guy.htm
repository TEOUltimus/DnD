<p class="size2">In a recent column, we examined the introduction of new
 players (people new to the hobby or new to your gaming group). The 
issues created by integrating a new person into your game are mostly 
interpersonal -- figuring out the newcomer's gaming style and 
personality, and how they mesh with the other people involved. Quite 
apart from these sorts of issues, however, are the ramifications for the
 campaign itself when a new person joins the party. Hence, in this 
column we will revisit the newcomer idea but from an in-game 
perspective: introducing a new character.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1.<i> How do they meet?</i> When introducing new 
characters to the campaign, give careful thought to how they meet the 
party. The scenario should not put new PCs in a compromising position 
and should provide some plausible in-game rationale for why they and the
 party should work together.</p>
<p class="size2">2.<i> Do they fit?</i> Does the character fit the party
 mix? Beware duplicating what the party already has, but new characters 
that are too different will not mesh with the existing party and really 
have no good in-game reason for why they would stay together.</p>
<p class="size2">3.<i> What do they know?</i> How much do they know 
about the campaign world at large? The previous escapades of the PC 
party? What the PCs are doing (or planning to do) at the time they meet?</p>
<p class="size2"> 4.<i> What about their stuff?</i> New characters 
should have roughly equivalent equipment to existing party members, but 
bear in mind that allowing them to freely choose equipment up to a 
preset g.p. value allows them to optimize values more effectively.</p>
<p class="size2"> 5.<i> "Hey, I've got this <b>great</b> character."</i>
 It can create a lot of complications, but it can also be very rewarding
 for the new player (and may inspire a more robust contribution to your 
game) to allow the conversion or import of an old character into your 
campaign.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>You probably don't want to just drop new characters 
into the middle of the campaign without inventing some reason for how 
and why they happened to run into the PC party, wherever it might be, 
and how (if at all) they might know the party members.</b> Creating a 
connection is easiest if the party happens to be "in town" when it runs 
into the new PC, but since adventurers spend the majority of their time 
out adventuring, first contact between the existing party and the new PC
 will most likely occur out in the field, perhaps even deep in the 
bowels of a deadly dungeon. Further, if the new PC happens to be a drow 
elf or some other exotic or evil race, you must take care to set up the 
encounter so that the PCs don't assume the character is an enemy and try
 to chop him or her into hamburger.</p>
<p class="size2">The classic setup for in-dungeon introduction of a new 
character is to make the newcomer a prisoner of the bad guys, grateful 
for release and eager to wreak vengeance upon his or her erstwhile 
captors. This is a simple and workable enough gambit, but you need to 
make sure you have the right sort of players <i>and</i> characters 
before you use it. Those in the party with more mercenary inclinations 
might try to extort some reward for the rescue, such as a debt of 
service (e.g., adventuring without treasure shares for a certain period 
of time). After all, the party <i>did</i> rescue the new PC, so 
shouldn't one good turn deserve another? A captive PC's gear also 
presents a problem. Any sane bad guys would not just manacle a prisoner 
to the wall without confiscating his or her gear first (or at least 
stripping weapons, pack, and perhaps armor). So does the PC then start 
out with no gear or very limited gear? Perhaps the gear is stored in the
 guardroom next door (which might strain credibility a bit, but is 
probably the best you can do with this scenario). Suppose the PCs invade
 the guardroom, whack the guards, and then find this lovely pile of 
loot. They divvy it up among party members. They then proceed to the 
next room, where they discover and release the captive PC. When the PC 
inquires about his or her items, some characters might be unwilling to 
give the items back; they were found as treasure already, so it's 
finders keepers, losers weepers. They might consent to sell or trade 
back the possessions in exchange for future considerations. This may 
seem like an outrageous stand for a party to take, but I've certainly 
seen this sort of thing happen. It's even arguably in character, 
especially for chaotic PCs. So how as a DM should you deal with this 
kind of problem?</p>
<p class="size2">The simplest solution is to avoid the prisoner scenario
 altogether if you think the players and characters in your campaign 
might turn it into an opportunity to shaft the new PC. If they must meet
 in a dungeon context, simply have the new PC meet the party fully 
equipped and exploring the same adventure locale for reasons of his or 
her own, which might turn out to be similar to those of the existing PC 
party. Even if the motives differ, they should be sufficiently congruent
 with the party's objectives to facilitate a reasonable agreement to 
work together on mutually compatible goals. This gives the new PC and 
the party a convincing in-game rationale for cooperating, and creates an
 opportunity to work together. Their relationship and partnership 
essentially begins on a temporary basis but then evolves into a 
permanent alliance as the new PC integrates with the party.</p>
<p class="size2">In addition to story issues -- how the characters in 
the campaign might react to the presence of a new person working with 
them -- we must <b>consider the game mechanic elements of the character and how they fit into the party in a meta-game sense. </b>The
 new PC's race has already been mentioned, but that is just one element 
in determining whether the character is a good potential fit. You should
 also consider what kinds of characters are already in the party, and 
think about adding a character who complements the party well. The 
player of the new PC should create a hero that he or she is happy with 
and excited about playing, but it doesn't hurt to at least consider the 
existing party's composition in deciding among several appealing 
alternatives. Depending on the campaign, the character's place of origin
 may influence whether he or she would mesh well with the party (e.g., 
if certain nations or cultures have particular amity or enmity for 
others). In some cases a DM might choose to restrict PCs to all being 
from the local area, while others might allow a character to come from 
more distant lands, or even <i>very</i> far distant lands (e.g., an <i>Oriental Adventures</i>-type character in a standard pseudo-European <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign).</p>
<p class="size2">The new PC's religion and (especially) alignment will 
usually be vital in determining how well he or she meshes with the 
existing PC party. To avoid conflict down the road, the DM should 
dissuade the player from choosing something too far different from the 
composition of the existing party. There is really no point in going to 
the trouble of rolling up and introducing a new character to the party 
if that character and the party have so little in common that they have 
little reason to stick together aside from the hamfisted fiat of, "This 
is a PC, therefore the party <i>must</i> adventure with him." I 
sometimes hear or read stories about characters who were such total 
bastards that even the other PCs didn't like them, and I can't help but 
wonder why their party-mates bothered hanging around with them! While 
there <i>is</i> a sort of implicit agreement in any RPG that players can
 create and run the characters they want, that is not a license to ram 
the most objectionable traits you can think of down the throats of the 
DM and other players. Simple consideration for the other participants in
 the game should be enough to dissuade players from wasting one 
another's time creating obviously unsuitable characters, and a little DM
 guidance in the character creation stage can nip a whole raft of 
problems in the bud in this area.</p>
<p class="size2">Once the character type has been chosen, the DM and the new player must <b>determine
 what the new character knows about what has happened in the campaign up
 to this point* and what the PCs are up to right now.</b> Prior 
knowledge and contacts can help provide in-game rationales for why the 
party would accept the PC as a comrade-in-arms. A reliable reference who
 can vouch for the newcomer may mitigate natural party suspicion of 
strangers. Knowledge may be colored by race, religion, &amp; place of 
origin, as well as what the new PC has been doing him- or herself prior 
to meeting the party. Background and prior adventures may even help fill
 in gaps in some mystery the PCs are attempting to unravel. Be careful 
not to provide too much information through the new PC, however -- you 
don't want to cheat the ongoing PCs out of the opportunity to work 
through the problem, nor the satisfaction of discovery when they puzzle 
it out.</p>
<p class="size2">Beyond role-playing considerations, equipping new characters presents a complex issue. It stands to reason that their <b>equipment should be reasonably similar to that of the existing party.</b>
 They should not be too far ahead nor too far behind; the DM should look
 at what has actually been handed out in the campaign thus far, since it
 may or may not correspond to the standard values for PC wealth by level
 described in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. The simplest solution 
is to allow the PC to "buy" an amount of magical, psionic, and/or 
mundane equipment up to the average g.p. value of the party members' 
equipment (or the standard <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> figures). But 
unrestricted choice for a new PC puts the character at a relative 
advantage vis-a-vis continuing characters: The party PCs have had to 
make do (for the most part) with what they have found while adventuring,
 or sold items at half value to save up and attempt to buy or commission
 an item specifically tailored to their tastes. New PCs have no such 
difficulties -- they can simply name the item they want and, if they 
have the g.p. value in their treasure allotment to get it, it is theirs 
without struggle or sacrifice. They also have the advantage of being 
able to bypass items, spells, powers, or other character choices that 
become somewhat obsolete with advancing level. In essence, the ongoing 
PCs may be carrying around some degree of dead weight in their treasure 
allotments, while a newly created character has free rein to optimize 
his or her selections. A little DM supervision can prevent these 
advantages from unbalancing the game.</p>
<p class="size2">Sometimes a new character is not really new at all. 
While the standard procedure for bringing in a new party members is to 
simply roll up an entirely new character, most players have sheaves of 
old character sheets from previous campaigns. Some may be much beloved 
by the player, and in the right circumstance he or she might ask to play
 an old character, suitably converted if necessary, in your campaign. 
Allowing this presents obvious complications, especially if the 
character is from another game system or even an older version of <b>D&amp;D</b>.
 Even if conversion is unnecessary or has already been undertaken, 
existing characters carry a lot of baggage. Their allotment of equipment
 may be unsuitable for the campaign (usually in the direction of being 
too-generously endowed) or they may have some oddball abilities or other
 special elements that the player would like to carry forward. (Think 
long and hard about anything like this, and usually say no.) A character
 of moderate to high level may have acquired titles or lands, and you 
must decide whether those are still part of the character's portfolio. 
Things can get even more interesting if the PC was a spellcaster who 
researched unique spells or created new magic items. Should you let the 
character into your campaign?</p>
<p class="size2">If you are inclined to allow the character, you might 
explain variances by ruling that he or she comes from another plane, an 
alternate Prime Material or some such. In this scenario, you must decide
 whether the character can ever go back (and how that might be 
accomplished), how much the character remembers from the old world, and 
whether his or her languages, currency, religious faith, and the like 
are automatically translated into their equivalents on this plane. If 
the PC is assumed to have always resided on this campaign world, then 
you need to decide how much of the previous-campaign background to work 
into your own campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">This sounds like an awful lot of work, and it is. So why would you ever want to do it? For the player's sense of fun. <b>A player who is really engaged and invested in a character will have more fun and will play him or her with more gusto. </b>Simply put, the player will <i>care</i>
 more about the character. This might be possible with a newly created 
character, but for most players a character that is made up and begun at
 middle or higher levels just doesn't have quite the same emotional 
resonance as one that he or she played up from 1st level. That doesn't 
mean they can't have fun playing such a character, but they might well 
have more fun playing a character with whom they have already formed an 
attachment. Given the potential complications, you are absolutely within
 your rights to tell the player that you're simply not comfortable with 
importing a character from another campaign, in which case the player 
just has to suck it up and deal, but it is definitely worth considering 
when bringing a new character into your campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">* It is helpful if the DM or one or more of the players
 keep some sort of ongoing log of the activities of the adventuring 
party. This can be a useful reference for continuing players, but it is 
especially useful for players just entering the campaign or who have had
 a prolonged absence from play due to work or other commitments.</p>
