as usual. Then Ally suggested that they head for the Temple of Morab.</span></i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Don't
 forget, guys, Melantha is a direct descendant of Eleazar the Wise, the 
great warrior-priest of Morab the Peacemaker! He founded the temple in 
this city over three hundred years ago."</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Yeah,
 we've heard it before," said Michael. "Whoop-de-doo! Mikko is an orphan
 -- no family, no history. He's a street-smart dwarf from the wrong side
 of town, and he depends on nobody and nothin' to make his way in the 
world! Who cares if your great-great-grandfather ten times over was some
 big muckety-muck? Once you get out into the wide world of adventuring, 
it's a true meritocracy. That family name isn't gonna buy you much at 
Crazy Joe's Treasure Hunter's Emporium."</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Well,
 it's important to Melantha," Ally said. "Besides, in the Middle Ages 
family lines and parentage and stuff were very important."</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Maybe, but <b>D&amp;D</b>
 isn't the Middle Ages in about a hundred different ways, Ally," 
countered Michael. "For starters, Melantha there would probably be 
forced to mind the kitchens instead of having learned how to fight and 
hunt and preach in the temple. So let's not get too carried away with 
the whole Middle Ages comparison!"</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"I
 suppose that's true, but it seems like in fantasy stories the heroes 
are always the descendants of the Great and Powerful So-and-so. Why 
doesn't that happen in <b>D&amp;D</b>? Shouldn't that sort of thing matter?"</i></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Do bloodlines really matter?</i>
 What difference does a character's background really make, especially 
something like long-ago family history? Do you need to deal with it?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>How big a benefit should characters get?</i> The <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i> and <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 pretty much set the precedent that benefits should be treated as feats,
 and PCs should be able to get one bonus feat that is appropriate for 
their heritage. You probably should <i>not</i> combine these and give one bonus feat for a region or culture <i>and</i> another bonus feat for a specific ancestor.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Is there any downside to the heritage?</i>
 A few feats have built-in downsides, but not many. This question is 
really more about whether some people in the campaign world will hate 
characters because of their heritage. The answer is probably yes, but 
don't overdo it and make clear how big a downside will really be.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>How free are players to design their heritage?</i>
 In general, the player decides what character to play, not you. Set 
limits and be mindful of people trying to take advantage, but give 
players plenty of room to imagine what they want their characters to be 
-- to try new ideas and tweak old ones.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>The generational campaign.</i>
 Think about setting a new campaign long after the conclusion of an old 
one, with the old PCs (and/or important NPCs) as the sources for new 
lineages that the players can really identify with.</span></p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ally
 asks a good question. The whole idea of being a descendant of some 
famous (or infamous) person is pretty much a staple of fantasy stories. 
For style and flavor, it shouldn't be too hard to fit into the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, but how do you set up your campaign to reflect the idea?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Or
 should you instead take Michael's position that historical bloodlines 
are irrelevant? You start in anonymity, and either die alone and 
unremarked or adventure your way to fame and fortune. There's something 
pretty appealing about Michael's point that adventuring is the ultimate 
meritocracy. But once you fight your way to the top, then what? What do 
you do after you 'win'?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Michael's
 idea might seem better suited to a computer game, with a definite 
beginning, middle, and end, than an ongoing face-to-face game, but he's 
not alone in preferring to play the game for <i>the game</i>. For 
players like him, deep background is something they'd just as soon keep 
to the margins. For other gamers, background adds interest, and for some
 it is the most important thing. Wherever your mix of players falls, 
it's something to think about in setting up the campaign.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 fantasy stories, sometimes an entire nation or clan descends from a 
common ancestor, and the people all live pretty much in one place and 
share certain common cultural traits. The family tree starts at the 
famous ancestor and then branches out from there. A PC descendant is way
 out at the end of one of the branches. From our own real-world 
perspective, though, we usually start thinking about a family tree with 
ourselves, branching up through our parents to grandparents and so on. 
You look up in the branches of your family tree, and you might see a 
famous leaf or two. It is a lot easier for Melantha to think about <i>her</i> ancestors than trying to figure out every person who might be a descendant of Eleazar the Wise!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There have been several different approaches to this idea in <b>D&amp;D</b>. The most developed example was the <b>AD&amp;D</b><b>Birthright</b>
 setting, wherein PCs could descend not just from famous people but from
 the gods themselves. Based on the strength of your bloodline and which 
deity it came from, you could have an array of special powers and/or an 
extraordinary appearance. Not all characters were "blooded," and there 
were downsides to it (like being drained of your divine blood-power by 
certain spells, monsters, and magic items), but it was definitely a big 
part of the setting, and you knew who belonged to whom!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The <b>Birthright </b>setting also made strong differentiations between human cultural groups, an idea that is also present in the 3rd Edition <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>,
 wherein characters can select regional feats based on their cultural 
heritage. This set-up doesn't tie the characters to a specific bloodline
 <i>per se</i>, but it assumes a generally common lineage for everyone from a certain region. The <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 hardbound takes the opposite tack in its use of ancestor feats, which 
do assume your descent from a very specific individual; the feat 
represents something for which the ancestor was famed. Ancestor feats 
are loosely tied to your clan, though you can choose ancestor feats 
outside your clan with the assumption that somewhere up in your family 
tree someone from another clan married into yours.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 each of these examples, the choice of background has some meaning in 
terms of game mechanics. You don't have to do that; choice of 
background, or even having someone famous in your heritage, could be 
entirely a roleplaying device. Does Melantha actually get anything out 
of being descended from Eleazar the Wise? Only if you want her to. In 
Eddie's world, he gives her a circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks 
with the folks at temples of Morab the Peacemaker, with a bigger bonus 
at the temple he founded in Terah. Not much there, just a little DM 
reward for Ally putting some work into her character design and rooting 
the character in the world.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are roleplaying considerations, like family fame or reputation (as discussed in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20030330a">an earlier column</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">),
 or how the character's connection to a long-ago ancestor is viewed by 
close family. Maybe Melantha's parents were pacifists who followed Rao 
the Peacebringer and disavowed any connection to the more militant Morab
 the Peace<i>maker</i>. They might consider the whole connection to 
Eleazar an unpleasant and embarrassing skeleton in the family closet, 
and might have disowned their daughter when she so openly embraced her 
connection to him. Maybe she gets a Diplomacy penalty with followers of 
other faiths that don't like Morab or Eleazar. Some heritage might give 
you distinguishing features, like hair or skin or strangely-shaped 
birthmarks or anything else you like.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ultimately,
 though, these are all flavor effects. If you decide you want a 
character's heritage to have more impact than that, then you need to 
answer a few questions (see sidebar). Should you make a character's 
heritage something that has substantial game effects, follow the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 principle that it's an option. You can choose to embrace your heritage 
or not, but you always give something to get something. If Mikko wants 
to be an orphan with no history, he doesn't get to take a feat based on 
an ancestor (unless you want to pull a Harry Potter, where he gets 
something based on a family history he knows nothing about), but he can 
take other feats instead, which might include a generic regional feat 
based on where he grew up. At the same time, he keeps a low profile and 
has no entanglements. He is not easily marked, as Melantha might be.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One
 last point about bloodlines is that they can seem kind of arbitrary to 
players, because they are! You, the DM created them, or borrowed them 
from some published work. You've made them a part of the framework of 
your campaign, but why are the descendants of Panthra bright and skilled
 with machines while Zurg's line traditionally wear masks in battle? 
They just <i>are</i>. An idea you might try when you're starting a new 
campaign is to set it a century or two later than the previous campaign 
and establish the characters from the earlier campaign into the 
background of the new one. That way, the bloodlines you reference can 
include characters whose names and traits are well-known to the players.
 If Eddie's next campaign is set 200 years later, then maybe Ally's next
 character is of Mikko's line, taking an ancestor feat that reflects 
Mikko's legendary skill at skulking and sneaking.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 sum, bloodlines are another way to tie characters into the web of the 
campaign world. They go beyond the characters' immediate situation or 
even immediate family and connect them to history and culture and the 
unique people that have made an impact on the campaign world. They may 
be an unnecessary distraction for your players, or they may provide a 
fun way to give one more dimension of depth to the characters they play.</span></p>
