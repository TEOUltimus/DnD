<p class="size2">Back in elementary school, many of us would get 
certificates on the last day of the school year for "perfect 
attendance." Whether you were smart, dumb, or anything in between, you 
could help the school run more smoothly simply by showing up every day 
on time and doing what you were supposed to do. Nowadays, most gamers 
have left elementary school far behind and are now busy teens, college 
students, or working adults. With increased age comes an increased array
 of demands on your time and usually decreased energy to meet all of 
them. However much you enjoy a chosen hobby, <b>there will be times when you are either too busy or too tired from your other busy things to make time to game.</b>
 This is perfectly reasonable and understandable, and no sensible member
 of a gaming group is going to pitch a fit about people attending to 
their "real world" responsibilities at the expense of gaming, and few 
gaming groups expect their members to have "perfect attendance"; even 
so, it does create problems for the flow of an individual game session 
and for the campaign as a whole. The purpose of this column is to 
illuminate some of the issues involved in uneven participation of 
players and their characters and how a DM can work around the 
intermittent absence of players and/or their characters and still 
maintain a quality game for everyone involved.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1.<i> Perfect attendance is hard to get.</i> Gaming is a
 leisure activity, so you can't really exert more than peer pressure for
 players to show up with responsible regularity. Know your players and 
your group and you can set reasonable expectations for yourself and for 
them.</p>
<p class="size2">2.<i> The Saga Party:</i> The story is all, and the show must go on. Your characters are in it, whether you are there or not.</p>
<p class="size2">3.<i> The Virtual Party:</i> The story is important, 
but player autonomy is also important. Your characters are always 
around, but when a player isn't, his or her character ends up "offstage"
 and only pops up at the DM's discretion to handle simple or 
straightforward campaign issues.</p>
<p class="size2">4.<i> The Modular Party:</i> Player control is the final word. If you aren't there, your character isn't either.</p>
<p class="size2">5.<i> Is it really such a problem?</i> In some ways, 
attendance is as much of a problem as your group lets it be a problem. 
If you all agree on what is expected and what happens with characters 
when players aren't present, then whatever problems may occur are 
minimized and livable, even if they are less than ideal.</p>

<p class="size2">In the first place, missed or delayed games could be 
addressed directly among the members of the gaming group. You may have a
 specific day of the week and/or time of day that you have traditionally
 played, but as the schedules and life situations of the members of the 
group change over time, it might be necessary to revisit that issue and 
determine whether a different meeting time might better fit the needs of
 the group. People within the group also move away from time to time; 
while you can't do much when a member makes a long-distance move, if one
 or more members move within the same city or area, it might be worth 
considering a move of the game site to one that is more centrally 
located and convenient for all players. Finally, schedules simply may 
not permit you to game as often as you once did. You might have played 
three days a week, ten hours a day when you were in college, but that 
isn't going to work for working adults. Members who get married and/or 
have children may spend more time with family and less time at the 
gaming table. Perhaps a once-a-week game is simply too big a time 
investment, and an every-other-week or monthly game might ensures better
 attendance and more cohesion and focus rather than trying to scrape 
together just enough for a weekly game. All of the above assume that you
 have group-wide issues with the meeting time. It may be that only one 
or two people have issues with the time or place of the game, and, if 
so, the group must decide how far it is willing to go to accommodate 
such individuals.</p>
<p class="size2">These are hard issues to deal with, and, in some ways, 
they are part of the often unavoidable evolution of your gaming group 
(sometimes even leading to the dissolution of one group and the 
formation of another). At the same time, these issues happen relatively 
infrequently and are fairly obvious. The more common, more subtle, and 
more insidious issues involving missed gaming time are not part of any 
large-scale disruption or life change but just an ongoing pattern of 
regular, day-to-day disruptions. One player has to work late and can't 
come. Another will be out of town next weekend. Another just got back 
from a trip and is too tired to play. Another's child got sick and they 
have to go to the doctor, or they couldn't get babysitting for the game 
night. Another has a friend in from out of town. All are reasonable, and
 all are part of normal life -- so exactly what is the problem here?</p>
<p class="size2">The problem is that for you, the DM, to structure 
challenges for a party and to craft interesting storylines for them to 
pursue, you must know the party that will face these challenges. If the 
party is not approximately the same from session to session, that 
obviously makes things difficult. In terms of structuring a quality 
campaign, you have to forge links between the characters and the world 
they inhabit. Doing so necessarily requires creating opportunities for 
the characters to deal with NPCs as people, and adventures or scenarios 
often end up focused on a specific character and his or her situation. 
Those familiar with the <b>Al-Qadim</b> setting may recall the "Birthright" adventure in the <i>Ruined Kingdoms</i>
 boxed set, in which one of the PCs is the long-lost heir of a wealthy 
merchant, who then must contend with a wrathful stepmother and the son 
she has raised to be the merchant's heir. Here is a situation rich with 
roleplaying possibilities and engagement with the inhabitants of the 
fantasy world, but suppose the adventure starts during one session, but 
that player cannot make it to the next session. What should you do?</p>
<p class="size2">This same principle applies equally well to the more 
nuts-and-bolts questions of the party's power level. If everyone in the 
campaign shows up for a session, the party is obviously strong that 
session. If only two people can make it the next session, they are much 
weaker. When numbers are few, you also run into balance problems -- the 
party may have nobody skilled at rogue-oriented abilities and end up 
stymied by locked doors or traps, or no cleric and be at a disadvantage 
against undead, or no strong melee person and be vulnerable to close 
combat. An encounter that you have scaled for one set of characters may 
be less of a challenge for one combination of characters but 
overwhelming for a different group. You can fix many of these issues by 
corrective scaling on the fly, but that is extra work for you. In 
addition, you just cannot adjust some situations too much without losing
 their impact in the campaign. If the campaign has been building toward a
 climactic meeting with the party's nemesis or a tough "final battle" 
against the leader of the forces of evil or they have completed some 
dangerous quest and now have returned in triumph to claim their reward 
from a thankful populace, can you play it out with just a handful of 
characters without cheapening the value and impact of it? A well-run 
campaign will flow through crescendo and up to climax, but if the climax
 is weak, it can taint the memory and feeling about the whole thread 
leading up to it. It's an empty feeling that can frustrate the DM and 
players alike when they feel like the dramatic energy of their efforts 
leading up to the intended climax go for naught -- like air leaking from
 a ruptured balloon.</p>
<p class="size2">A simple solution is to allow characters to simply come
 and go as their players happen to be present or absent. This has the 
advantage of expediency, but comes at a high price in believability. If 
the party has been thrown in the dungeon and the player of Brother 
Thaddeus the Cleric arrives, does the character suddenly pop up in 
manacles next to the rest of the party? Is he even aware of what's 
happened? What if the events that happened would likely not have 
happened if he had been there? Can he then reasonably be held 
responsible for participating along with the rest of the party? On the 
other hand, if the characters are always present and active, front and 
center stage, regardless of whether the player is there that day, you 
open up a whole new can of worms about who decides what the character 
will do, who really controls the character and its creative direction, 
and on and on.</p>
<p class="size2">Taking the above into account, how can you and players 
alike manage the issue? The most obvious answer is for players to be as 
conscientious as possible about attending gaming sessions regularly and 
on-time, or giving notice as far in advance as possible when they can't 
make it. Despite players' best efforts or intentions, they frequently 
have to miss games in lieu of more important things, and when that 
happens, the DM and players need to come to an arrangement about what 
will happen in their absence. Some of the possible options could include
 the following:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Saga Party</b></p>
<p class="size2">In this model, all of the characters always remain 
present and active. The storyline of the campaign and its internal 
consistency trumps all other considerations. The characters belong more 
to the campaign than to the players who created them. If the character's
 player is not present, then someone else (either another player or you 
as the DM) will run the character and it will take its lumps and earn 
its rewards along with the other characters. The show must go on, with 
or without the players in question (which obviously makes this model 
less than ideal for players who have a strong investment in their 
character's behavior and decisions).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Virtual Party</b></p>
<p class="size2">In this model, the characters are present but take no 
active role unless their player is present. In a manner of speaking, 
they are always around somewhere in the vicinity of the action taking 
place "onstage" in the campaign, but their activities are taking place 
"offstage."' Their offstage presence enables character-specific campaign
 elements to be plausibly maintained without forcing players to 
surrender control of their characters. When they are not there, their 
characters are simply assumed to be busy doing other things (guarding 
the horses or prisoners, taking care of personal business, sleeping, 
examining the tapestries). If time and effort are not at issue, you, the
 DM, can allow the party to make use of the abilities of the inactive 
PCs (for example, healing from a party cleric, or identifying magic 
items, or making certain skill checks), though this should be watched 
carefully to avoid abuse. When the player shows up, the player pops into
 active mode as though he or she was there all along.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Modular Party</b></p>
<p class="size2">In this model, characters come and go along with their 
players. When the player is not there, the character is unavailable, 
plain and simple. When the player arrives, you, as the DM, choose a 
suitable moment for the PC to appear and connect with the rest of the 
party. Whoever happens to be there is there; whoever is not is not. 
(This obviously can create problems with logical discontinuities between
 one session and the next, but that is the price to be paid for total PC
 independence.)</p>
<p class="size2">None of these is a perfect solution, but each group 
will have its own opinion on how best to deal with the issue. For most 
groups, the virtual party is probably the best compromise solution. It 
lacks the story continuity of the saga party and the total player 
control of the modular party, but it allows for maintaining a reasonable
 continuity while still allowing players more or less full control of 
their characters. Whichever way you arrange things, you will still have 
disputes over treasure distribution (whose character was present for a 
given mission, adventure, or encounter, and whether that is relevant to 
your treasure distribution system, as discussed in a previous column), 
the direction of the campaign, and so on.</p>
<p class="size2">The simplest solution, of course, is for everyone to be
 there all the time, but the expectation of perfect attendance is not 
realistic. The reason why this is all a problem is quite simply because 
all gaming sessions are not created equal. Some sessions are simply more
 important than others in determining the direction of the campaign, 
sometimes because the encounters in that session have the potential for a
 Total Party WipeoutTM -- those who show up risk their characters and 
even the continuation of the campaign, while others are not at risk (and
 have no opportunity to help). Sometimes the sessions are more important
 because the party makes a decision about whether to go into the 
mountains to hunt the Ghost of the Giant-King or head south to 
investigate the mysteries of Darken Wood. If John Q. Player happens to 
miss the session where the decision is made, the party may end up going 
off in a direction he doesn't like. You can dismiss this complaint with 
the admonition that he should've been there (or sent his vote by email 
or other proxy), but what if Jimmy J. Player, who happens by only once 
in a while, showed up that day, so he <i>does</i> get to vote while 
faithful regular John gets knocked out of the loop? There are no easy 
solutions to a problem as fundamental as this, but using forethought and
 good communication can help forestall arguments. As long as everyone 
understands how the system works, when you're there and when you're not,
 <b>you probably have a system that everyone at least can live with, and that is usually good enough.</b></p>
