the fact that I can </i>alter self<i> into something with a swim speed doesn't hurt . . . "</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Oooh, check out the big risk-taker," Michael shot back.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Melantha actually has a couple of ranks of Swim, so I'm game for it," Ally chimed in. "Figures I didn't prepare </i>water walk<i> today, and I used up my only scroll of it."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"I think this is a bad idea," David said. "I mean, 
come on -- we all know what happens in every fantasy and sci-fi movie or
 story. When you go in the water, something</i> bad<i> is waiting there

<p align="left"><i>"The water is calm," Eddie announced, "so getting across is not too hard. And nothing attacks you. Everyone crosses safely."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"This can't be happening," David said. "Something is fishy."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Ally, make a Survival check for Melantha The rest of you make Spot checks."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>After the checks are resolved, Eddie chuckles. "Well,
 none of you see anything amiss, but Melantha's knowledge of the wilds 
clues her in to a funny sort of numbness spreading all over her chest 
and legs. On taking a peek inside your chain shirt, you see that you are
 covered with a swarm of fat black </i>leeches!<i>"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"EWWWWWWWW!</i></p>
<p align="left">Quite a satisfying reaction, and just what Eddie was 
looking for. If you're going to go to the trouble of creating something 
new, the last thing you want is a ho-hum response.</p>
<p align="left">And so begins Part 5 of our Behind the Screen workshop 
on building campaign story arcs. Our fictional DM, Eddie, is building a 
theme around an ancient race of frog-folk called sivs, and we're using 
his process as a model for creating your own unique campaigns. <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/bs">Previous columns</a>
 have dealt with designing monsters around a central theme, establishing
 the main antagonists and their servants, and adapting existing monsters
 by using feats, "character regions," and templates to customize them. 
Not everything has to tie to your main villains, though -- don't forget 
about the little incidental monsters that fill out the rest of a 
campaign. This column is about is making something new, addressing a gap
 in the game.</p>
<p align="left">In Eddie's case, it would be a pretty boring jungle if it were simply all sivs, all the time. A jungle is supposed to be <i>alive,</i>
 so he needs to fill it. He's still working hard to create his new 
campaign, but decided he'd drop one of his fresh creations into his 
ongoing campaign to take it for a test drive. Leeches are a classic icky
 hazard of jungle stories and movies, so they seemed like a great filler
 monster to bring home the creepy jungle theme. Eddie has made his 
leeches a type of swarm because he noticed that most existing swarms are
 great for underground or cooler climates but don't really seem to fit 
outdoors or the tropics. What kind of swarm would fit a hot jungle? 
Leeches! But a swarm adaptation offers only one possibility for leeches,
 or the filler creature of your choice. How do you get from an idea to a
 worked-up creature?</p>
<p align="left">One idea is to make your new creature idea not actually a <i>creature</i> in game terms, but a <i>hazard</i>
 instead. Something like green slime is a good example; it used to be 
treated as a monster, but what does it really do? It just lies there and
 turns anything that touches it into green slime. Okay, we could say 
something similar about leeches. They don't do anything by themselves, 
but if you go through the leech area (a stagnant pool or tall wet grass 
or whatever), the leeches drain blood for 1d2 Constitution damage or 
inflict filth fever or whatever you decide. How do you avoid it? Don't 
go in the leeched area, like Mikko climbing around the pool. If you go 
along the edge of the area (say, if Melantha had a <i>water walk</i> 
spell to cast), maybe you get only partially affected, or not at all. 
Maybe you have to burn out the little bloodsuckers with fire, or apply a
 certain amount of salt -- anything is fine, as long as the hazard has 
some kind of countermeasure (like <i>remove disease</i> with green slime).</p>
<p align="left">If you do want to make your new adversary an actual 
creature, think about what is most similar to it in the game. Is there 
already a creature that does what it does? If so, you could still create
 your new monster just for the sake of variety (say, a predatory 
tree-dwelling lizard with stats identical to a leopard, or a huge 
prehistoric hyena that works just like a dire wolf). It saves you time 
making up new stats and injects some unique local character into your 
campaign arc. </p>
<p align="left">Other times, there's really nothing quite like what you 
have in mind. Still, you can find things that are similar to it to use 
as a model. You're not trying to replicate that monster, but you can 
compare your creature to the existing one, see where one is stronger or 
weaker than the other, and calibrate the monster to be what you want it 
to be. That is helpful in figuring out appropriate CR for new creatures.
 If your party has actually faced that kind of monster before, you can 
think about how they approached it and decide how you want to tailor the
 new monster specifically with your characters in mind. It's possible to
 overdo that (making monsters designed to go against the characters in 
your game) but as long as you put thought into the process, why not? The
 PCs are the characters who are going to face the creature. If you 
create a monster that they're going to wipe off the map in one round, 
you're probably wasting your time. The creature won't be around long 
enough to make any kind of an impression or give you much payoff for 
your hard work in creating it. That doesn't mean every monster should be
 a supermonster -- just that you need to consider how you'll use it.</p>
<p align="left">So, back to Eddie's leeches. He likes the idea of the swarm template for the jungle. In fact, all those <i>National Geographic</i>
 specials about the jungle were all about swarms, so he actually has it 
in mind to make a couple of new swarm types (see sidebar). He has found 
lots of interesting individual monsters to drop in here and there, but 
Eddie loves the idea of the swarm as an emblem of the jungle itself as a
 character in the campaign -- something that is alive and dangerous. The
 swarms will really make it feel oppressive and sticky and crawling with
 unpleasantness, and that's exactly what he wants. A campaign theme is 
really all about mood, atmosphere, and presentation, and selecting old 
monsters or creating new ones should be done with an eye toward 
enhancing that.</p>
<p align="left">All the categories we talked about <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20040829a">last month</a>
 regarding developing a creature template still apply when designing a 
whole new monster. There are also tips on creating monsters in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">Monster Manual</a></i> and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">Dungeon Master's Guide</a></i>,
 so I'll skip the general advice this time. Instead, I'll encourage you 
to think hard about what you are designing this new monster to do.</p>
<p align="left">For the leeches, they will be creepy all by themselves, 
but what will that mean in game terms? The trick of the leeches is that 
they're sneaky. They have to be hard to spot, so that you can't see them
 right away and know to avoid them. The Hide skill is necessary. Once 
you get close, you don't notice they're all over you until <i>they're all over you</i>!
 Ewwww! So they need some kind of anesthetic power so that you don't 
notice you're getting attacked right away. But they're a swarm, right? 
Don't all swarms have distraction as a special power? Maybe this is the 
one swarm that doesn't. Or maybe you're distracted by it only after you 
notice. When they're just quietly sucking out your lifeblood, you don't 
know to be terribly afraid yet! Also, even when you get out of the area 
where the leeches swarm, they keep hanging on to you, so there should be
 some kind of mechanism to represent the leeches that remain stuck to 
their victims. Plus, leeches are carriers of disease. A glance at the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 diseases table (Table 8-2) and how diseases are transmitted suggests 
that red ache might be a good choice for something that lurks in nasty 
water and sucks your blood; its also a fresher choice than the overused 
filth fever.</p>
<p align="left">As a new monster, though, your creature also needs 
weaknesses. What can one use to stop slugs and leeches? Salt! Your 
players know that, and they'll figure out a way for their characters to 
know that, too. Be prepared and figure out the effect of obvious 
countermeasures ahead of time, so you aren't left there wondering right 
in the middle of the game, "Hmm, how much damage should salt do to a 
swarm of leeches?" Don't forget special benefits or vulnerabilities of 
creature types and subtypes either (in this case, a swarm of vermin).</p>
<p align="left">Leeches, of course, are just one of a zillion possible 
examples of monster creation, but this illustration hits the basic 
needs. A leech swarm fills an apparent gap in the monster list. It does 
something interesting and different. It fits with the theme and the mood
 that Eddie is trying to create. So he sprung it on his players a little
 early, before they even get to the jungles. It's always good to keep 
the PCs on their toes, and when they are trudging through the sodden 
underbrush of the jungle primeval they'll be wishing it was as easy as 
climbing around a cave wall to get away from the terrible swarming 
jungle creepy-crawlies!</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>A squelching mass of tiny black slug-like horrors 
engulfs everything it touches, quivering and slithering over every 
exposed surface.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Leech swarms typically lie quiescent in stagnant pools, 
waiting for prey to come to them. While they are capable of surviving 
out of water, they will rarely stray more than 5 feet from the water's 
edge (though some leeches will cling to creatures after they leave the 
water).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A leech swarm will move slowly toward any creatures in 
the water and attach to them, using their anesthetic to remain unnoticed
 so that they may drain as much blood as they desire before dropping off
 and returning, engorged with blood, to the water.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Anesthetic (Ex):</b> Unlike other swarms, a leech 
swarm is not distracting to creatures within it (until they notice the 
leeches; see below), and in fact often goes unnoticed until it is too 
late. The victim of a leech swarm's attack must make a DC 15 Survival 
check to notice the swarm's attack, and a DC 15 Search check will reveal
 the leeches crawling into and under a person's garments or armor and 
attached to their skin. This Search check is made with a +1 bonus per 
point of Constitution drained by the leech swarm, as the leeches become 
engorged with blood and easier to find.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> In any round in which it begins
 its turn with a living creature in its space, a leech swarm will drain 
blood, dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage. Once the swarm has 
inflicted 4 or more points of Constitution damage to that target, the 
leeches detach and become quiescent again until they have digested their
 feast (requiring one hour). This has no effect on blood drained from 
other creatures; a leech swarm may drain blood equal to 6 points of 
Constitution from each creature within its space. Creatures leaving the 
swarm after the leeches have dropped off must still contend with 
lingering leeches.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Creatures with a natural armor bonus of +5 or better are
 immune to the blood drain attack of a leech swarm and are not subject 
to lingering leeches, but still suffer normal damage and a risk of 
disease from contact with a leech swarm.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Disease (Ex):</b> Red ache -- swarm attack, Fortitude DC 12, incubation period 1d3 days, damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Distraction (Ex):</b> Any living creature that begins
 its turn with a swarm in its square must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude 
save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Note that unlike other swarms, a leech swarm's 
distraction ability comes into play only after the leeches have been 
noticed. While the anesthetic effect remains in place, creatures are not
 distracted by a leech swarm.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex):</b> A submerged leech swarm can hide anytime it is submerged in murky or weedy water, even while being observed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lingering Leeches (Ex):</b> If a leech swarm has 
successfully drained blood from a creature, many of the leeches from the
 swarm will remain attached even after the creature has left the swarm 
behind. These leeches will continue to inflict 1 point of damage and 
drain blood for 1 point of Constitution each round for 1d4 rounds after 
the creature leaves the swarm. This blood drain does not count against 
the swarm's maximum drain. The anesthetic ability described above also 
applies to noticing and finding these lingering leeches. The lingering 
leeches can be attacked as a leech swarm, and any attack that inflicts 
even 1 hit point of damage will cause them to drop off (though this does
 not count against the hit points of the leech swarm from which they 
came).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Salt Vulnerability (Ex):</b> A leech swarm suffers 
damage from contact with salt. A pound of salt is as effective against a
 leech swarm as a flask of alchemist's fire. A handful of salt tossed 
upon a leech swarm inflicts 1d3 points of damage. The leech swarm or one
 or more of its victims must be at least partially out of the water to 
be attacked with salt; salt is ineffective against a leech swarm if it 
is completely submerged. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> A leech swarm has a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks. A leech swarm has a +4 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks in water. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A leech swarm uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier for Swim checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A leech swarm has a +10 racial bonus on any Swim checks 
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose 
to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
 the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. </p>
