<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px;"><i><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"All
 right, Eddie," Ally said, "Melantha gets out three vials of holy water 
and we each pour one on the evil black flaming pentagram."</span></i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"The
 flames sizzle and hiss and then are extinguished," Eddie said. "The 
angelic being within steps forward. You hear the ringing tones of its 
voice inside your mind as it asks which of you is the leader of this 
sorry mortal band."</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"That
 would be me," David said, ignoring Samantha's glare. "Rashean Bantecou,
 minstrel and smiter of tyrants. My name is legend in this country!</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"More
 like a legend in your own mind," Samantha snapped. "Eddie, I make my 
Knowledge (planes) roll to see if I can pinpoint the type and power 
level of this celestial. Looks like a 31."</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Sheesh! You and your modifiers!" Eddie shook his head. "All right. It looks to you like a mighty planetar."</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Woo-hoo! I'll pour on the charm and see if I can wheedle some curing and maybe a </i>true resurrection<i> out of him for poor Mikko. Hmm, how about a 19 on Diplomacy?"</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><span style=" font-size:12px;">"The
 planetar's gaze seems to pierce through your very soul as he shakes his
 head sadly. 'Oh, how weak and tainted your hearts are. How small your 
minds and vision. You have done me a service, so I will bring your 
friend back to life, but then I must return my attention to cosmic tasks
 far beyond your comprehension and whose importance beggar description!'
 He steps over to Mikko's dead body and touches it. A spark of energy 
passes into Mikko as he slowly stirs to life."</span></i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Sheesh, check out the attitude on this guy!" Ally said. "I point out that we </i>are<i>
 laying the holy smackdown on the High Imperceptor of Bane here -- it's 
not like we're just out rolling paraplegic kobold children for their 
milk money. I've got three levels of cleric. Doesn't that count for 
anything with this guy?"</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><span style=" font-size:12px;">"The
 planetar simply mutters a disgusted oath in Celestial before vanishing 
in a flash of light." Eddie passed a note to Michael, whose character 
was just brought back to life.</span></i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"That level-stealing bastard!" Michael said. "That cheapskate planetar did a </i>raise dead.<i> I thought you said it could do a </i>true resurrection, <i>Samantha?"</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><span style=" font-size:12px;">"It could, but I guess it decided not to. Kiss that level goodbye, Mikey. Tough break."</span></i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Hey
 Eddie," Michael said, "Mikko shouts to the heavens: 'Thanks for 
nothin', you sanctimonious jerk!' When I get that level back, I'm takin'
 it in Ranger this time, just so I can make 'outsider (good)' my new</i><i>favored enemy!"</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Michael's problem -- really his whole party's problem -- is one that pops up now and again in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 campaigns and in game-related fiction (maybe most infamously in Gary 
Gygax's Gord the Rogue series, when the celestial is willing to bring 
only one of three dead party members back to life, even though they are 
on a mission to save the world). The party tromps through some benighted
 hell-hole, comes upon an imprisoned celestial creature, braves deadly 
dangers, traps and guardians to free it, and maybe even loses one or 
more characters in the process. Rather than showing gratitude, the 
celestial cops an attitude, grudgingly offers some minimal reward or 
assistance, then disappears.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Does
 Michael have a legitimate gripe? His character -- and party -- is out 
doing good deeds, maybe even trying to save the world (or a big piece of
 it) from the forces of evil. One would think that their goals and those
 of most celestials would be pretty congruent. Given this, it seems 
reasonable to assume that any given celestial they encounter should be 
willing to lend more than just the bare minimum of assistance to their 
mortal allies, especially for a character like Mikko who gave his life 
in the effort to liberate it from imprisonment. If you add on top of 
this the reasonable expectation that <i>any</i> newly freed prisoner 
might feel inclined to show some gratitude toward his or her rescuers, 
then it seems like a just-rescued celestial should be just about falling
 all over itself to help.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ally
 asks another good question: Shouldn't Melantha, as a cleric serving the
 powers of good, have some kind of claim on the assistance of celestial 
creatures? Any divine spellcaster might feel reasonably entitled to a 
little positive attention from the celestial minions whose mission of 
divine service they share. This expectation could extend to devout and 
faithful lay followers of good deities. If Rashean Bantecou (David's 
bard) has donated large sums of money or provided other assistance to 
the good temples in his home city; does that count for anything when 
dealing with celestials? Can you build up heavenly "brownie points" by 
good living? It does make a certain amount of sense.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Unfortunately,
 these seemingly valid in-game rationales create a lot of complications 
(often from a metagame perspective) for the DM. One problem is the 
literal <i>deus ex machina</i> involved. If Eddie is going to introduce a
 celestial being into the adventure that is capable of solving the 
problem, then why is the party there at all? If he wants to use the 
"free a trapped celestial" plot element, he either needs to use a 
celestial so wimpy that its abilities are irrelevant in the big picture 
or else somehow constrain what it can do. Otherwise, why should 
Melantha, Rashean, Mikko, and Arphaxad waste time and effort doing what 
the celestial could do better and more easily than they could? Eddie's 
adventure needs to be centered around the PCs finding and facing the bad
 guy, not on them trying to find a helpful NPC (the planetar in this 
case) to fight the bad guy for them. (Unless Eddie constructs the 
adventure so that freeing the trapped celestial is a key point -- many 
adventures require the recovery of some plot device, be it creature or 
object, as a necessary step to defeating a super-powerful bad guy.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 some cases, a freed celestial might join the party, much as any other 
NPC could take up with his or her rescuers for a time after being freed.
 This alternative begs all the usual questions about who will run the 
character (usually the DM, so more work for you), what the character 
knows, how trustworthy the NPC is, how much control the party has over 
the NPC's actions, and so on. But it also creates additional 
complications, especially in campaigns like Eddie's, because the 
planetar would be far beyond the power level of the party. Even 
lower-power celestials would wield more power than the average party 
member or possess capabilities he doesn't want the party to have access 
to, like the ability to <i>teleport</i> at will. Arphaxad's <i>bag of holding</i> and <i>necklace of adaptation</i>
 could turn any willing celestial into a taxi service or at least a 
teleporting messenger or transporter. It's not so much the outsider's 
combat-relevant spell-like abilities that are problematic, but the 
useful miscellaneous ones (e.g., <i>dispel magic, detect</i> [any], <i>passwall</i>). In effect, a celestial in the party is almost like an unlimited-charge magic item.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 theory, all of these elements can be addressed through proper 
roleplaying. Just because Arphaxad demands to be toted around in the <i>bag of holding</i>
 doesn't mean the celestial will do it. If Mikko gets raised from the 
dead, what is he complaining about? He was dead and is now alive, and 
tough noogies if he dropped a level! The celestial is not the party's 
slave. It is not a walking magic item. It is a real creature with 
thoughts and feelings, which might be very different from the mortals 
around it even if they share a common alignment. Developing those 
interactional constraints on what the celestial can and will do takes 
time and effort, though, and those may be in short supply given the 
other necessities of running the game. If they are given short shrift, 
though, we are right back to the PCs asking something reasonable -- 
something that the<i> players,</i> being the clever beasts that they are (and frequently the DMs of other campaigns), <i>know</i> that the celestial <i>can</i>
 do -- of the celestial and having the celestial refuse, for seemingly 
no reason other than that the DM's whim. Are the PCs using player 
knowledge that their characters wouldn't have? Maybe, but their 
characters might have high Knowledge skill rolls, too.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So,
 what's the answer? Are angels just as big a bunch of creeps, in their 
sanctified way, as demons and devils? Should good-aligned PCs simply 
stop expecting anything helpful out of them? That seems wrong somehow, 
and yet it's a hard one to call. Like most things, the solution lies in 
finding balance. If the players want a celestial that they can order 
around and compel to do things, there are methods for doing that, such 
as <i>summon monster, planar ally</i>, and <i>planar binding</i> spells, where there is little ambiguity about who is doing what for whom and at what cost.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Other
 celestials can be run like you would any NPC -- with reason, wit, 
personality, and even a touch of humanity. PCs who approach them with a 
gracious spirit should be met with the same, and celestials with a good 
reason to help <i>should</i> be willing to offer what help they can (or 
offer future aid), whether magical, physical, or simply wisdom and 
knowledge. If Melantha is a faithful cleric of good, maybe she has 
earned a circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks with celestials. 
Likewise, Rashean might have curried favor with the divine forces for 
his good deeds or his donations as a lay member of the faith or simply 
because his store of bardic knowledge suggests the proper forms of 
address and ritual to use when dealing with particular types of 
celestials. If Mikko has sacrificed himself to help gain the celestial's
 freedom, the celestial should be willing to put itself out for him. Be 
flexible and reasonable, and above all don't go out of your way to make 
the players hate the celestial good guys worse than the fiendish bad 
guys!</span></p>
