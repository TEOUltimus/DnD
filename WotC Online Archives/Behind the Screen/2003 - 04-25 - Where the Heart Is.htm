<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One
 of the purposes of this column is to include not only discussion of 
in-game details and how to enhance them but also to deal with the people
 issues involved with the flesh-and-blood human beings sitting around 
the table. The entire experience of <b>D&amp;D</b> is suffused with an 
emotional and deeply personal subtext of motivations and hopes. You 
can't invest the kind of time and effort required to play <b>D&amp;D</b>
 on a consistent basis without investing some of yourself into it, so it
 should hardly seem odd that there is overlap between intra- and 
interpersonal issues and the conduct of the game. You cannot honestly 
and fully deal with the game without understanding at least some of 
those issues, and hopefully this column may provide suggestions or 
insights that will help DMs to do just that. </span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">WORDS TO THE WISE</span></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>An example:</i></b> One day at the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, Mary says something to John that she thinks is fairly innocuous, a
 teasing joke that should be taken in good fun. John explodes with 
outrage and a crisis ensues. Is Mary in the right, because her comment 
was meant in fun and should have been taken that way? Is John in the 
right because he perceived it as inappropriate and offensive? What 
should the DM say or do?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><b>An analogy:</b></i>
 Mary sees a pool of liquid and assumes it is water. She drops a match 
into it and is surprised when it turns out to be gasoline and it 
explodes. She can't understand why the "water" exploded from that tiny 
match; it seems to make no sense. John (the gasoline) knows perfectly 
well that he is <i>not</i> water, and can't understand why Mary couldn't
 see the difference or smell the dangerous fumes, or shouldn't have just
 known that he was gasoline all along. From his perspective, Mary is 
either an idiot (for not knowing) or insensitive (for knowing and not 
caring).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><b>The analysis:</b></i>
 Mary approached the situation assuming a certain reaction and was 
surprised when it did not happen that way because she failed to take 
into account the fact that John would perceive things differently. Mary 
didn't think that the joke was any big deal, and by extension thinks 
that John should feel the same way. John has an entirely different cloud
 of experiences and attitudes through which events are perceived and 
processed, and in some ways the reaction is as much a reaction to those 
things as it is to the specific trigger. The "match" thrown into the 
situation by Mary's joke is the catalyst for the whole reaction, 
activating the potential barbarian rage that was sitting there below the
 surface.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><b>The resolution:</b></i> Is it <i>all </i>Mary's
 fault? Not entirely, since to an extent John is taking out his anger 
about other things on Mary, but he is the proximate cause of the 
explosion and bears the greater share of the responsibility. Whatever 
the resolution (which, depending upon the seriousness of the conflict, 
may ultimately involve one of the people leaving the gaming group), 
accountability must fall more heavily on the one who initiated the 
crisis. The ultimate effects of the crisis on personal relationships 
among group members is outside the DM's responsibility, and though that 
is a factor to consider it must be of secondary importance in resolving 
the crisis at hand. Favoritism in a crisis can destroy a group's 
confidence in the fairness of the DM, even if done in the name of 
friendship.</span></p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 frequent issue is when a member of the gaming group feels burned out or
 worn down by personal or professional circumstances. Causes can range 
from simple fatigue due to overwork or lack of sleep, to complex and 
far-reaching concerns such as marital problems, illness, or a death in 
the family. Job stress can also play a role, whether from one's own job 
becoming unpleasant or uncertain in its future (or flat-out losing a job
 and being out of work) or simply from a toxic atmosphere at the 
company, such as heavy layoffs or other upheavals.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Different
 people react differently to these kinds of situations. For some, gaming
 begins to feel like an obligation, a chore. Even if the gaming itself 
is enjoyable, the prospect of having to be with people and present at 
least a moderately cheerful or pleasant demeanor when they don't feel up
 to dealing with people at all is none too appealing. They might even <i>want</i>
 to play, but don't trust themselves not be snappish and take out 
frustrations on people who don't deserve them. So whether to preserve 
their own peace of mind or to avoid spreading the misery they fear has 
"infected" them, they simply avoid social situations. They drop out of 
the game, whether for a little while (if the crisis is temporary) or 
maybe permanently.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others,
 however, look at the opportunity to game as a chance for an escape from
 the slings and arrows of everyday life. The opportunity to play a 
character has a role in this, since for many gamers the characters they 
create are often idealized versions of themselves, or of some facet of 
their personality, and playing allows them to give voice to a part of 
them that feels frustrated or stifled in their everyday lives (sometimes
 because of outside issues, and sometimes because it's a part of them 
that they <i>wish</i> could be more like that character but which they 
have never been able to fully embrace). In the game, they can do things 
that they can't in the real world. They can see right and wrong in black
 and white, and they can take the fight to the enemy. They can fight the
 power. They can conquer injustice. Some of the make-believe is also 
bound up in simple acts of whimsy -- a character may have a particular 
mode of friendly banter or rivalry with another, and the game provides 
chance to play through that and enjoy the camaraderie. Gaming lets them 
forget their troubles for a little while, or at least push them to the 
back of their minds. For at least a time, they can find respite from the
 worries, or just the humdrum monotony, of everyday life in a 
technicolor fantasy world where anything is possible.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finally,
 gaming can be a form of therapy. Beyond the general sense of being able
 to play out wishes and dreams, you can use it to work through a 
situation that is troubling you, in the same way you might use a journal
 to "write yourself clear" on an idea or a situation. Also, simply being
 in the company of gaming friends who like and validate you can be a 
source of strength and a counter to the weight of outside troubles, even
 if you don't explicitly share your troubles or concerns with the group.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A whole new set of concerns results when tension arises between two (or more) people <i>within the gaming group.</i>
 (as opposed to one player and their job, or one player with their 
non-gaming spouse or family). This idea was explored in an earlier 
column ("<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/bs/bs20020728a">When Good Times Go Bad</a>"),
 but I touch on it again here to explore an additional wrinkle. That 
column suggested that a game-related conflict (whether in-game or 
out-of-game) could be resolved simply by not playing together anymore. 
That resolution doesn't work as well in a situation where friendships 
transcend the game situation. If one player somehow ends up in an 
irreconcilable strait with another, there is "spillover" onto other 
people. Players not directly involved in the dispute may feel loyalty 
with one party or the other. Do they, too, quit the game as a show of 
support? Moreover, what about their real-world relationships with group 
members? Will they be tainted by the dispute?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These
 are very difficult issues. We do not live in a world where everyone 
gets along all the time, and that is where part of the DM's job as a 
manager comes in. A DM must be able to understand the points of view of 
the people involved and should at least try to mediate disputes. One of 
the roles of a mediator is to act as an interlocutor ("one who talks 
between" ) for both sides. That presupposes that DMs have the ability 
and inclination to try to put themselves into the shoes of each party 
and to help each side see the dispute from the side of the other. If at 
least a modicum of understanding can be attained, then the DM can try to
 facilitate some accommodation; if none can be reached, the DM must make
 the ultimate decision as to where the gaming group will go. Some 
disputes will ultimately have little impact on the gaming group, but 
others may have a large impact, including splitting a group in two. To 
the greatest extent possible, however, the DM should practice, model, 
and encourage -- in a sense, <i>enforce</i><b></b>-- a norm within the 
gaming group of recognizing and respecting different points of view in a
 dispute and making decisions based on that.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 is not nearly as easy as it sounds, however. One of the reasons is that
 human beings have a natural tendency to "universalize" -- to assume 
that, at some level, all right-thinking people should agree with them. 
It is a natural first impulse to interpret and judge situations based 
primarily on your own perceptions. This tendency becomes even more 
complicated when the people involved in a dispute are from different 
religious or cultural backgrounds, or are of differing gender or sexual 
orientation. Just as in our day-to-day life our work and our culture is 
becoming more diverse, multicultural, and global, we need to keep in 
mind how some things we say or do might cause offense, quiet distress, 
or confusion to others at the gaming table. While we approach gaming as 
fun, it is group fun and a social activity, and carries the same social 
challenges as life in our modern world. How gaming groups deal with 
this, and to what degree others do or don't take offense, is just as 
complicated as in everyday life.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 example, one player might make an offhand comment he considers 
innocuous, without realizing he has offended another player or made her 
uncomfortable. Jokes and humor are a famously tricky subject across 
these lines, because what may be funny to one person may be demeaning or
 insulting (or simply tasteless and rude) to another. Some players may 
feel comfortable with the rapid-fire teasing and sarcasm that often 
proliferates at the gaming table, while others from a different 
background, or personal and family/cultural history, and style, may take
 such banter as ridicule.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">DMs
 are well advised to do frequent "reality checks" at the table and away 
in private, to make sure that players who are just the quiet sort aren't
 getting hurt over things that others are just seeing as "good fun" or 
"general rambunctiousness." Consider your players as individuals, and 
you may be able to avoid misunderstandings and friction before they 
start. This doesn't mean that you need a complete personal dossier on 
everyone you play with. It does, however, mean that you have a 
responsibility as a DM to get to know the people you game with -- their 
likes and dislikes, their personal issues -- and then take those into 
account in how you (and they) behave toward one another.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There
 will be times that you and/or your players have more important things 
on your mind than the latest hack-fest or save-the-world mission. There 
is a strange sort of intimacy in gaming, given long play sessions and 
long periods over which campaigns take place, but that intimacy is 
always mediated by the game itself. You can get to know others very 
well, but you can also choose to be very distant in your gaming, not 
really engaging other than to the extent necessary to keep the game 
moving. If nothing else, this column is a call to engage, to be 
purposeful about reaching out to and connecting with the people you game
 with. Don't just rely on your natural inclinations; develop a habit 
within yourself of empathizing with others, of learning enough about 
them to see things from their perspective. What you learn about them and
 how well you get to know them will affect the richness and enjoyability
 of your game and can provide a sense of strength, support, and 
encouragement to anyone in the group experiencing a time of trial.</span></p>
