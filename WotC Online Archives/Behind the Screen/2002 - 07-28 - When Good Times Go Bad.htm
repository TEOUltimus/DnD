<p class="size2">In the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/bs/bs20020630a">last article,</a>
 we discussed the importance of having a thorough knowledge of the rules
 and how that can impact how you plan and structure your game as well as
 the way you actually run the game during play. The rules of the game 
are important, and your knowledge of them is equally important, but, as 
has been stated previously, none of that amounts to a hill of beans if 
you and your players are not happy with the game. Lack of rules 
knowledge can bog a game down and make it less fun, but strife and 
dissension at the gaming table is the real game-killer. Interpersonal 
interactions are complicated, and I don't for a second want to suggest 
that conflict or disagreement will shirk your gaming table. That is just
 as ridiculous as saying people never disagree in their regular everyday
 lives. Even if you are married to one of the other gamers in your 
group, you are still going to argue at least some of the time. The 
problem comes when a disagreement leads to "put up or shut up" time 
between two people, and you as a DM will face a hard decision. I say 
"you as a DM" not because DMs are the only people that ever start 
arguments, but because <b>you are ultimately the "manager" of the game</b>, and the buck stops with you.</p>
<p class="size2">Sometimes disagreements arise and you don't really have
 much of a role in them. These matters usually take place in character 
and then lead to a disagreement or argument between the players of the 
characters involved. Sometimes these events are predictable, such as 
when one character betrays another in a campaign situation where the DM 
and the betraying player presumably built up the betrayal. Disagreements
 can also occur over more capricious in-character acts, such as when one
 character steals from another or a character abandons another character
 in danger. Still other times, problems come up over structural issues 
of how to handle complex issues such as dividing treasure. The players 
ultimately must resolve these kinds of issues since their characters are
 directly affected. </p>
<p class="size2">That said, you will invariably become implicated in a 
dispute of this kind for "letting them get away with it." Even in cases 
where a plausible in-character reason exists for doing something, the 
other players may feel that they got the shaft and that you just stood 
by and let it happen. In cases where the party has made agreements to do
 things a certain way, you will generally <b>be responsible for reminding them</b>
 of the commitments that they have made. In cases where the in-character
 betrayal has been building, you will of course seem complicit in not 
just <i>letting</i> the player get away with it but as actively aiding 
and abetting the crime. The issue of characters attacking, robbing, 
killing, or otherwise harming (or deliberately allowing harm to come to)
 other party members also creates a problem for you, because the end 
result of such action over and above hard feelings is that you will be 
forced to spend game time creating and integrating new characters, and 
watching out for and managing acts of player-to-player revenge. Most 
players can take in stride things that happen to their characters, but 
even the most easygoing player may want to get medieval on another who 
he or she feels has wronged them. Hence, even if you feel that it <i>should</i> be an entirely player-to-player interaction, you should <b>be ready to step in</b> if it seems like it is about to (or has already started to) cause out-of-character problems.</p>
<p class="size2">Lest we think that all such disputes occur between 
players, as DMs we must be cognizant of our own actions in the game. As 
has been stated before in this column, roleplaying games are not a 
contest between you and the players. You hold all the cards in the game 
and could do anything you want to the characters. The players in turn 
can choose to tell you to take your game and shove it. While most 
disgruntlement with a DM's in-game behavior often stops short of causing
 players to want to quit the game, you should <b>be aware of your own actions in the game</b> and <b>how these actions are perceived by the players</b>.</p>
<p class="size2">A common DM trap is playing favorites. You might like 
certain players or certain characters more than others, so you structure
 adventures wherein rewards tailored for those characters just happen to
 pop up a little more often or where things seem to go their way. Some 
of this is probably unavoidable, but you should remain aware of this 
factor and guard against it because those players not so favored will 
not appreciate such behavior. Even if you are even-handed in your 
treatment of players and their characters, however, playing favorites 
can take the form of slanting things in favor of the players as a group 
or in your own favor. Most commonly, this takes the form of fudging die 
rolls either for or against the party. I will be the first to tell you 
that there is nothing at all wrong with fudging dice rolls from time to 
time. At the same time, you must remember that <b>the life of a game depends on uncertainty </b>--
 uncertainty about what lies ahead, uncertainty about whether the 
characters are best prepared to face whatever challenges they may meet, 
and uncertainty about whether the best odds they can manage will be good
 enough to win the day. If you routinely fudge die rolls, you can be 
sure that your players will start to notice -- the bad guy always seems 
to make his saving throw against the really good spells or to always 
miss when the hero fighting him has only a few hit points left. Whether 
you fudge die rolls to favor the monsters so they always thrash the 
characters (or at least always give them a tough fight) or to favor the 
players so that they are rarely or never in any legitimate danger of 
character death is immaterial. When the players <i>believe</i> that you 
are manipulating the outcome in this way (and belief here is more 
important than reality), whether in favor of a particular character, all
 of the party, or yourself, the game ceases to be a cooperative 
roleplaying game and turns into them playing out <i>your</i> fantasy 
story. That may be fun for you, and you may not even realize anything is
 amiss, but it is likely to be pretty unsatisfying to them and may lead 
to you looking up one day and having no players left who want to play in
 your game.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1. You are the manager of your game. However, let 
players sort out most in-character issues. You can offer advice or 
suggestions, but leave decisions about how to play out party issues and 
conflicts to the players.</p>
<p class="size2">2. If a player disagreement occurs over something that 
they had already agreed on, remind them of the former agreement. If a 
disagreement arises over something like a character betraying the party 
in some manner, be ready to step in and help address the negative 
emotions.</p>
<p class="size2">3. Be aware of your own actions in the game and how those actions are perceived by the players.</p>
<p class="size2">4. Be very careful about manipulating the outcome of 
the game by playing favorites, fudging die rolls, railroading players 
during adventures, and the like. It can steal the uncertainty and the 
sense of control and investment players have in their characters if they
 feel that you are ultimately the one controlling things.</p>
<p class="size2">5. Show class, courtesy, and respect to one another 
during games. You can always tease and tell jokes and be silly, but 
don't snipe, gloat, or ridicule. Make sure that you're not the only one 
laughing.</p>
<p class="size2">6. If you are having a problem with the people playing 
the game or the way it is being played, don't be ashamed to say 
something about it. Try to talk out the issue and resolve the problem 
before it festers and becomes unbearable. Make sure that everyone 
involved with the problem is aware that there is a problem and include 
them in the resolution process. </p>
<p class="size2">7. If a problem gets to the point that you cannot just 
ignore it or let it go, then be willing to step forward and take a stand
 and to accept any consequences that come along with it. Be ready to 
stand on principle, but be aware that there may be a cost. </p>

<p class="size2">Presenting the game is more than just letting the dice fall where they may, of course, and you can find an example in a <i>Gamestoppers</i>
 article on this website in which the DM taunted the players about how 
ineffectual their characters were against "his monster." While the 
fictional DM probably played the encounter by the numbers, he had taken 
the position of running "his" monsters against "their" characters and 
seemed to gloat over the fact that he was "winning." It's perfectly fine
 for a DM to joke about characters and their actions in the game, but 
you need to <b>make sure that you are not the only one laughing</b>. We 
should all learn to try not to take things personally when they aren't 
meant as such, but the onus is on the DM to make sure that sarcasm, 
teasing, and other gaming table humor, especially that originating from 
behind the screen, is given and taken with good humor and to be ready to
 step in if it is not. You shouldn't have to play a humorless game (the 
ones I play and DM in certainly have laughs to spare), but take care 
that everyone is in on the joke, especially the character (and his or 
her player) who is the butt of it.</p>
<p class="size2">All of the concerns raised above are legitimate and 
valid, but ultimately they are concerned with things that happen within 
the game. Above and beyond strife that may arise within the game, 
however, are those disagreements that are purely person-to-person and 
have nothing to do with fantasy. All players of the game (DM included) 
must get along on a very basic interpersonal level, and when a problem 
arises in this realm, then <b>everyone involved needs to make a decision about how to address the issue</b>. Lest this seem too abstract, I will provide an example from my own experience.</p>
<p class="size2">As noted at the bottom of the column, I am not only a 
gamer who has been in the hobby for over two decades, but also a 
Christian. About a year ago, I sent around an email asking the players 
in my campaign to try to refrain from using God/Jesus-related profanity 
at the table because I found it offensive and disrespectful to a faith I
 hold dear. Most of the players said that was fine, that they were sorry
 if they had offended me, and that they would try to avoid doing it in 
the future. Most of my players are not Christian (or even hold religious
 beliefs at all), but they took it as a reasonable request out of 
consideration for one of the other participants in the game. I have not 
made a general habit of imposing my faith or values on the players -- I 
don't drink, but I also don't make a fuss if someone brings an alcoholic
 beverage; I rarely use profanity, but I don't make a fuss about others 
doing it (as long as my kids are not around at the time) -- and I had 
not even raised this issue until it had begun to nag at me over the 
course of weeks and months and I decided to say something about it.</p>
<p class="size2">One player did not agree with the others, however, 
feeling that my request was tantamount to censorship and that he had 
heard things at the table that had bothered him (though he did not 
provide any specific examples) and had said nothing; hence, I should be 
willing to do the same. At this point, we each had to make a choice of 
principle vs. people: Was the principle on which we took a stand worth 
the potential sacrifice of the relationship with the others? In the end,
 we each chose to stand on principle, and he left the gaming group. I 
haven't seen him since then other than via online discussion groups now 
and then.</p>
<p class="size2">It was a disappointment to lose a regular member of the
 group, and this is the risk that you take when you choose to make a 
stand on principle. It is not only your risk, however, as other players 
will also be affected by the potential loss of one of the gaming group 
(especially if your group is small), and, as the DM, you are at least 
partly responsible for what happens to the group as a whole. You 
obviously don't want to run off your players on a whim, so if you're 
going to take a stand, <b>make sure that it is something that you feel strongly enough about</b>
 that you are willing to accept that risk. If you find yourself 
confronting another member of the group when voicing an issue, you have 
to decide if your objection to it is strong enough that you would rather
 quit the game entirely than continue to play in that environment. 
Everyone has a different threshold of tolerance for what they can put up
 with and what they can't, and you are ultimately the only person who 
can make that call. It's a tough situation to face, but if the issue is 
important enough to you and you want to clear the air in a group of full
 of simmering resentments, then say what you have to say and let the 
dice fall where they may.</p>
