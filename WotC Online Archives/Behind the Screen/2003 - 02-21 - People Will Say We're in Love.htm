<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Love makes the world go 'round, or so the song goes. It therefore stands to reason that characters in a<b> D&amp;D</b>
 game ought to be as susceptible to Cupid's arrow (or Sune's, or 
Freya's, or whomever might be appropriate in the campaign pantheon) as 
people in real life. The adventurer's life is a hard one, fraught with 
many dangers -- you can view that fact as a negative for romance, or as a
 strong motivation for developing some non-hack-related interests and 
relationships. To assume that characters are emotionless robots makes 
them less human, less real, and less fun. It also violates the standard 
tropes of fantasy fiction, upon which many of the principles and ideas 
of the game are based. <b>Whether tragic, sentimental, fierce, simple, 
or transcendent, love is a staple of fantasy fiction, and to the extent 
that players draw from that common culture of fantasy in imagining their
 PCs, the love relationships of favorite characters are very important 
in defining those characters and their motivations for becoming the 
heroes that they are.</b> For these reasons, we should take a look at the way love and relationships can be used to enrich a game.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">1.<i> What does love look like?</i>
 Decide what the common cultural norms are for public and private 
expressions of love and affection in the game world. How much (if at 
all) do they differ among various races, religions, or cultures? What is
 the standard domestic situation? Is monogamous marriage the norm or the
 exception?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">2.<i> What about homosexuality?</i>
 Does it exist in the game world? Is it a conscious choice that can be 
changed or a natural inclination that cannot? Is it always either/or, or
 might a person be attracted to both genders? If it exists, how is it 
perceived in the general society? Do views on such relationships vary by
 culture?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">3.<i> Make a clear differentiation between the players and the characters.</i>
 This almost goes without saying, but it can be an especially tricky 
proposition when dealing with romance. People could get the wrong 
impression or simply be uncomfortable with roleplaying flirtation, 
courtship, and other elements of romance, and they shouldn't be pressed 
to deal with it if they don't want to.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">4.<i> Realize the in-game ramifications of love and romance.</i>
 If the loved one is also an adventurer, should he or she be integrated 
into the adventuring party? How -- cohort, ongoing NPC, new player 
character? If the loved one is content to stay at home, how does that 
impact the adventuring character?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">5.<i> Don't punish a character for falling in love.</i>
 Players willing to engage in the roleplaying challenges of a 
character's romantic issues should not be penalized with a neverending 
string of betrayals and hostage situations. That's not to say they can't
 ever happen, but they should definitely be rare.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In considering love and relationships in a campaign world, start by imagining that world's cultural basis. <b>Different societies express and describe love in different ways,</b>
 and explicating the love ideas held by a culture can help a player get 
inside the mind of his or her character. The best source for thinking 
about imaginary people is our own world's real people and real cultures,
 with their amazing richness and variety in relationships and 
expressions of love. Gender, too, plays a role: Males and females often 
have different norms on what kinds of displays of emotion or affection 
are appropriate. Even within an individual culture, consider not just 
romantic relationships but other types of love. For example, think of 
the different types of love within a family: the devoted love of a 
spouse, the dutiful love of a child, the warm and enfolding love of a 
parent, the doting love of a grandparent, the affectionate rivalry 
between siblings. Each has its own characteristics and means of display,
 which probably vary between public and private settings.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 possibilities for constructing these kinds of relationships within your
 game world are endless, but they are not usually too difficult to 
extrapolate for some cultures, especially the demihuman races. The 
particulars can, of course, vary from campaign to campaign, but the 
"typical" dwarf is likely to be gruff and not apt to display a lot of 
public tenderness. Dwarven affection may be abrasively good-natured -- 
cutting remarks and sarcasm may be their tools of choice. The more they 
browbeat you, the more they like you. Elves, on the other hand, might be
 more comfortable with lingering gazes deep into the eyes of a loved 
one, sharing their mutual reverie to the exclusion of others nearby. The
 degree of reserve versus openness demonstrated within a culture, or 
within any subcultures (e.g., social class, rural vs. urban dwellers), 
is one way that you can establish realism and context. Ask "What would 
my character think about this?" to help prevent all characters from just
 being ciphers for our 21st-century mindset. Establishing norms for the 
culture characters come from does not dictate PC behavior, but it 
explains what is considered "normal" or "typical" in that milieu.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Speaking of "normal," <b>one point to consider is how (or whether) to represent heterosexuality versus homosexuality in your game world.</b>
 If reproduction occurs biologically in a manner modeled on our own 
world, then most creatures probably will be heterosexual. To keep things
 simple, you might elect to ignore the issue entirely -- assume everyone
 is "straight" unless a player has a different character concept for an 
individual PC. Or, you might decide that homosexuality does exist in the
 game world. If so, determine what is known about it and how the general
 population feels about the idea. Are homosexual relationships common 
dalliances that no one thinks twice about, or rare liaisons that inspire
 gossip? Is homosexuality a conscious choice or biologically determined?
 Is bisexuality possible? How are homosexuals perceived within the 
culture -- are they a persecuted minority, a scorned but tolerated 
fringe group, mysterious folks that most people don't even know about, 
or just one of many subcultures about which the mainstream is 
ambivalent? It may seem silly to argue whether homosexuality exists or 
is considered "normal" in a fantasy world, but the connection with the 
concerns of the everyday helps make any character or world more real.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The most thoughtful background preparation, however, may not eliminate <b>complications that can occur at the game table when it comes to actually roleplaying romantic relationships. </b>There
 can be uncomfortable aspects that blur the distinction between players 
and their characters. One PC, for example, might make advances on 
another, and it's hard to convey that by roleplaying unless you add in 
the sort of flourishes that in other situations would be considered 
direct flirtation. Sure, you know that it's just part of the game, but 
it can nevertheless mess with your head. Players who are dating or 
married to each other may have particular issues with roleplaying their 
characters' relationships, in some cases allowing their PCs to fall very
 easily into romance (perhaps too easily if their characters are not as 
compatible as the players are in real life), or having very mixed 
feelings (at best) should one member of the couple have their character 
get involved with someone else's character.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Roleplaying
 romance can become even more complicated when a PC's gender differs 
from that of the player. Suppose a male player has a female character, 
and you are a male DM who has set up a situation where a male NPC makes 
romantic overtures to the character -- writing love letters, reciting a 
romantic poem, or whatever. While it makes sense within the game, the 
way it plays out might make the player uncomfortable. Perhaps someone 
uncomfortable with imaginary males coming on to his feminine alter-ego 
in the game shouldn't be playing a female character (and vice-versa for a
 female player with a male character), but while that is a fair point it
 may explain why most games don't deal much with issues of love and 
romance. For some, the payoff in terms of character development isn't 
worth the real-world uneasiness required to roleplay the fantasy 
romance.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One
 safe way of handling love and romance is to displace it onto the NPCs 
in the party's circle of friends. Rather than creating a love interest 
directed at one of the PCs, direct it at a cohort, hireling, or ally. 
This keeps the <i>idea</i> of romance "on stage" in the game without 
requiring the PCs themselves to be directly involved. Such a solution 
can be more complicated than it sounds, however, as these sorts of love 
relationships can seem contrived. In addition, if a PC's cohort gets 
involved in a romance it can be seen (with good reason) as dividing that
 character's loyalty and affections. Say the cohort woos and marries his
 sweetheart -- will the marriage affect his adventuring career? This 
could be a particularly sensitive issue for religious characters, 
especially those who follows faiths based in community, family, 
childbirth, and the like.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This perhaps gets to the real meat of why love and romance in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 games is a difficult issue. As noted above, the interpersonal nature of
 the game can get a little weird when playing out a fantasy romance 
without crossing lines of appropriate social behavior, but that is only 
part of it. <b>No matter how comfortable the players may be in talking through the fantasy romance, it creates complications in the campaign. </b>Where
 does the relationship lead, if anywhere? Is it enough for characters to
 just date ad infinitum, or to make like Conan and have a new guy/girl 
in every town? Lawful characters or those whose religions emphasize 
family and community are not likely to favor that kind of dalliance, so 
they are left with a choice between chaste celibacy or the potential of 
giving up their career in exchange for a home and family.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It
 stands to reason that characters with the spirit and inclination to go 
adventuring are most likely to be attracted to others with the same 
interests; if they should decide to start a family, however, then 
presumably at least one of them is going to have to retire to attend to 
hearth and home. On the other hand, it might be eminently reasonable for
 two adventurers in love to continue their careers and eschew 
procreation. Whether dating or married, they live out their relationship
 through their adventuring. This can work out fine if both characters 
are PCs, but if a PC hooks up with an adventuring NPC, how should you 
handle it? A simple solution is to have the NPC travel and adventure 
with the party, but this has the downside of giving the DM an NPC that 
is always there and must be handled. If the NPC is delegated to a 
character (the obvious choice would be the character with whom the NPC 
has a relationship), then in effect the NPC becomes little different 
from a cohort -- an NPC whose primary loyalty (and obedience, to an 
extent) is to one character, not to the whole party -- but without 
requiring the character to actually take the Leadership feat. From the 
standpoint of game mechanics, the DM could forbid the NPC from 
adventuring with the character until he or she acquired Leadership, but 
this doesn't seem to make much sense. Can love happen only every three 
levels when a feat slot comes open?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even
 if a character finds a non-adventuring partner who is interested in 
being a stay-at-home spouse, this puts a considerable emotional burden 
on that person. The domestic spouse of an adventurer will likely spend a
 lot of time alone, like the spouse of a sailor or soldier, and even 
when home the adventurer is essentially always "on call" in case of an 
emergency situation. The adventuring spouse also faces the possibility 
of death or dismemberment as a daily hazard of the profession. The 
adventurer may have to keep secrets from his or her spouse as well, 
especially if the flavor of the campaign runs to uncovering plots and 
conspiracies. The spouse of a successful adventurer, especially one who 
has won a noble title or similar royal grant of authority, does stand to
 enjoy considerable material prosperity, but the latest sack of gold and
 jewels may be cold comfort to a someone left alone for weeks or months 
at a time. It is also a recipe for potential disaster in terms of 
marital fidelity. Even if love is steadfast and true, loved ones and 
home may be in constant danger from enemies a hero makes in his or her 
career, from common crooks to extraplanar entities seeking to strike the
 adventurer where he or she is most vulnerable. (In fairness to players,
 DMs should not overdo this plot device.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 is the tradeoff that an adventurer must make: deciding what price to 
put on love, romance, and relationships. It makes intellectual sense 
that characters should have impulses, a desire to find love, affection, 
acceptance, constancy, comfort, and all the rest. A player faced with 
such a situation must decide whether he or she is personally comfortable
 with playing out the in-game romance with another player or with the 
DM, and this may stop a lot of in-game romances in their tracks. Even if
 everyone is comfortable with the idea of it, a player has legitimate 
metagame concerns about how the relationship will impact his or her 
character if carried to its logical conclusions. Characters may decide 
that, while love and marriage are appealing, adventuring is the life 
they have chosen and adventuring it shall be. The life of a hero is 
tenuous and often short, and a potential partner might not want to risk 
trading too soon a wedding dress for widow's weeds. In its own way, the 
idea of love lost, delayed, or denied out of duty or necessity is a 
fantasy tradition in itself. Ultimately each player and DM must decide 
how much to deal with the issue, and that may be but a silent, stoic 
tear as love is left behind for the open road.</span></p>
