<p class="size2">In building the best possible game, we have examined 
how important it is for DMs and players to come to a group consensus 
about what they will play and how they will play it. The setting and 
parameters of the game established by you, the DM, help frame the 
players' expectations and their ability to set and achieve satisfying 
goals within the game. The essential art of running the game is 
simultaneously offering enough variety that the game does not become 
monotonous, while at the same time providing enough world stability and 
reliability that players can make meaningful assumptions about it. This 
delicate balance between variety and predictability is our topic in this
 article.</p>
<p class="size2">At its core, any world needs a sense of structure and 
an idea of what constitutes the ordinary and the everyday. The beauty of
 creating a fantasy world is that this ordinary, everyday context can be
 virtually anything, and it can vary a great deal from place to place, 
but characters need to have some sense of what is "normal." A common 
fallacy of the "normal" is that it is boring or uninteresting by its 
very nature. I am not suggesting that we all start playing <i>Farmer: The Roleplaying Game</i> and count out turnip seed by the bushel. What I mean by this is that you can make the ordinary vital and real by learning the <b>art of rich and evocative description</b>.
 When the players enter a city, you should spend a minute or two 
describing the sights and sounds and smells that they encounter. Have a 
list of food and drink they can buy in the local inn. Talk a bit about 
the weather, especially when they are traveling cross-country. The 
people they meet should be more than just stat blocks, and the places 
they go should have more detail than just terrain modifiers and 
encounter matrices.</p>
<p class="size2">However, evocative descriptions are not simply a matter
 of delivering information. In many ways, presentation is just as 
important as content, because all the description in the world won't do 
you a bit of good if the presentation is not memorable. One of the 
quickest routes to boredom is information overload; once they reach the 
saturation point, your players will start tuning out the flavor text. A 
gamer--even the most devoted gamer--can dedicate only so much mental 
energy to the mythical reality of the game world. Dumping pages of 
background information and descriptive text is in some ways a seductive 
trap -- a fool's gold promise -- that may seem to give the players a ton
 of context for making the game come alive but which often causes 
players to ignore the "fluff" and become impatient for a resolution or 
summation. In presenting descriptions, background, and contextual flavor
 about your world, be selective; feel free to fill out the surroundings 
and give enough description to give a flavor for where they are and who 
they are dealing with, but try to emphasize the points that are relevant
 to the adventurers and what they are doing. Not everything needs to 
deal with the PCs and their present situation; indeed, legends and 
rumors can provide an excellent opportunity for foreshadowing future 
adventure opportunities and give the players a sense that the world 
exists even when they are 'off-stage' (that is, when the PCs are not 
involved). In short, you must simply be judicious in the use of 
descriptions and information so as not to swamp the players with 
information overload.</p>
<p class="size2">While presenting descriptions and information, leaven 
your descriptions with cues, which may be illustrations or visual aids 
(drawings, photographs, maps, and so on), vocal inflections or accents, 
common game-world sayings or habits (or even personal quirks of 
particular NPCs), or even props of any kind that are appropriate to the 
adventure. These may be things of your own creation, they might be 
included within a published adventure or supplement (or you may 
appropriate a picture or two to use even if you're not using that 
adventure or supplement), or they may be from some nongaming source. You
 can find some great illustrations and pictures in books or on Internet 
sites that deal with travel, art, history, architecture, or myths and 
legends. Providing sensory cues other than just listening to you talk 
presents a mental association for players that can help them ground 
their recollections and bring them to mind more easily and with greater 
effect.</p>
<p class="size2">One facet of making your world coherent and comprehensible is <b>defining exactly what PCs should know</b>.
 This is partly a matter of you making up your own mind about how things
 work in the world and partly a matter of defining what is known and not
 known about the world by the general populace. What is generally 
"known" in common knowledge may or may not actually be true, but the 
fact is that everyone knows (or thinks they know) x-and-such about the 
world, and that includes the players and their characters. What do PCs 
know about the geography and politics of the world? Do they know that 
the dwarven kingdom of Krongg exists or that it mines purest adamantine 
in its deepest mines? Have they even heard of Gildur, the country across
 the sea, and its rapacious thieves' guilds? If the PCs are very 
provincial, every adventure they take may well be as much an exploration
 as a journey, where everything is new. If they are somewhat more 
cosmopolitan, with a certain basic understanding of what is where in the
 world, then their travels may be more like simply going from point A to
 point B within their own backyard. It is a difference of feel more than
 anything else, but it can change the fundamental motivations and the 
range of choices that players may feel for their characters. If they 
don't know something exists, they have no basis to pursue knowledge of 
it unless you put it in their path; you, the DM, must ultimately choose 
the palette of choices available to players in the world.</p>
<p class="size2">Framing the world and what is known about it is not 
merely a question of style, but it also becomes a game mechanic issue: 
What character races and classes exist in this game? Prestige classes? 
Spells? Feats? Skills? Magic items? Are players limited to what's in the
 <i>Player's Handbook</i>, or perhaps even less than that? If players 
don't know about certain things, does that mean that they don't exist or
 just that they haven't yet learned about them? Perhaps the Elemental 
Savant prestige class from <i>Tome and Blood</i> exists in the world, 
but PCs have no knowledge of it at the beginning of the campaign and 
discover it only if they unearth an ancient tome of magic. Maybe the 
divine feats from <i>Defenders of the Faith</i> are taught only within 
certain priesthoods and are unknown in others. While adopting this 
technique of progressive revelation can be an interesting way to go, it 
has consequences for gameplay in that it may hamstring PCs in their 
choice of prestige classes or feats with specific prerequisites. If you 
elect to begin with characters in partial or total ignorance, you must 
make some provision for the availability of what will be revealed later 
on, either by <b>modifying the prerequisites</b> of published feats, prestige classes, or whatever it may be, or by allowing players the option of <b>revising their characters</b> at the time new information becomes available. One of the comparative strengths of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 vs. earlier versions of the game is that choices are much more open for
 a character's pattern of advancement. Whereas the choice of race, 
class, and skill set was a once-and-done choice made at creation and 
virtually impossible to change thereafter in <b>AD&amp;D</b>, in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 you can select from an array of options each time you gain a level. If 
you constrain choices at the beginning and then introduce new options 
later on, players may feel frustrated at lacking the opportunity to 
tailor their characters to take advantage of those options. The new 
choices you offer may end up being no choice at all if you take a hard 
line, so if taking a hard line is important to you as a DM, set the 
options at the beginning of the campaign and then leave them alone.</p>
<p class="size2">Whether you add game mechanic options in midstream or 
not, you should have in mind what kinds of rare or unusual knowledge or 
secrets PCs can learn during the course of their careers. As noted 
above, this might include new game mechanic options or experiences 
gained through travel and exploration. These new experiences might 
inform them about other lands and peoples or even allow them to see 
their own homeland and people as others perceive them. It might include 
uncovering secret evil plots of a hundred varieties, or it might include
 knowledge of or access to secret societies or organizations, which may 
or may not have associated skills, classes, feats, spells, or whatever. 
It could even lead to specialized training opportunities if such are 
required in your campaign.</p>
<p class="size2">However you choose to structure common knowledge vs. uncommon knowledge or normal vs. abnormal, the simple act of <b>establishing a baseline understanding</b>
 of the world for the players and their characters is crucial. Making 
this baseline clear enables you to make differences be really <b>different</b>;
 it provides a foundation from which variety can depart. With no 
baseline, variety ceases to be a meaningful concept, because you 
effectively make everything into a formless and ultimately bland mélange
 of flavors wherein nothing really stands out as meaningful. If you want
 players to engage the fantasy world of the game, you need to give them a
 conceptual framework for making sense of the world. When they know the 
characteristics and common traits of people, cultures, nations, and 
creature types and the physical world in which they exist, they can make
 associations about how they all fit together and apply their knowledge 
and experience in how they want to make their way in that world. When 
they know what they usually expect, they can then make useful judgments 
about things that happen that are unexpected or unusual and that perhaps
 require the attention and specialized skills of a group of adventurers.
 At that point, real adventuring can begin!</p>

<p class="size2"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>1. Establish a Baseline:</b> You need some foundation for judgment of what constitutes variety, or else you just end up with a lot of formless nothing.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>2. Make Your Descriptions Rich:</b> Don't agonize 
over every detail, but emphasize the points that are relevant and that 
ought to be memorable. Present them in a variety of ways.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>3. Decide What Is Common Knowledge:</b> What does everyone (or at least the PCs) <b>know</b> about the world, or at least what they <b>think</b> they "know."</p>
<p class="size2"><b>4. Decide How to Handle New Discoveries:</b> What knowledge or secrets can the PCs learn in their adventures? How can they make use of it?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>5. Make Differences <i>Different</i>:</b> Defining the usual and expected makes the unusual and unexpected stand out, which causes both to be distinctive and memorable.</p>
