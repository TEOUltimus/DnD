<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Roleplaying games, like all games, are essentially the gathering together of friends to have fun. Whether you are playing <b>D&amp;D</b>,
 checkers, cards, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, or even "spin 
the bottle," you have people interacting with one another in a leisure 
setting. There will be a light spirit in the air, and that naturally 
leads to good-natured jesting and teasing, time-honored (or time-worn) 
in-jokes, and lively, spirited banter. As a DM, should you attempt to 
regulate the natural humor that flows from the social situation of a 
bunch of friends having a good time? Yes and no.</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Humor is a natural element between friends.</i></b>When
 a group of friends gets together for leisure activities, joking, 
teasing, and humor will likely ensue. Let it, and participate in it, but
 be aware of the mood at the table and step in if a joke seems to be 
going too far or if excessive joking around disrupts the game.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Employ humor where it is appropriate.</i></b>Humor
 can disrupt the mood of a game. If a particular situation is meant to 
be frightening or solemn or exciting, don't break the dramatic tension 
simply for the sake of a joke. There will plenty of time for laughing 
about it later.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Use caricature.</i></b>Personalities and situations can and should be larger than life. This is a <b>fantasy</b> game, and the more robust -- and sometimes even outrageous -- the character or situation, the greater the chance for humor.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><b>Good humor depends on relationships.</b></i>
 Banter, wordplay, puns, and all manner of jokes become more relevant, 
real, and funny when shared in the context of an ongoing relationship.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>If it's funny once, it's funny a second time!</i></b>Much
 humor can be found in repetition, sometimes on purpose (a player or the
 DM repeating an action with a character) and sometimes organically 
through the campaign, where one character (or the whole party) just 
keeps finding herself in the same ridiculous situation again and again. 
Be careful, however, of overdoing it.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 the most part, the DM is part of the social situation, and your only 
"responsibility" is to participate and have fun, to give as good as you 
get. These are your friends, too, and you are hardly above the need or 
desire for jollity and companionship. So by all means, jump in and have a
 good time yourself. But, as has been pointed out numerous times in this
 space, there is a sense in which you take on the role of a manager when
 it's "your" game, especially if it is played at your home or office. 
You are the person who should keep at least half an ear open to the flow
 of conversation and be willing to step in if it seems like a joke is 
being carried too far or has touched a nerve. Most of this interaction 
is self-regulating and doesn't really need any attention from you, but 
it doesn't hurt to keep aware and alert to make sure that everything 
begins and ends all in good fun. You also need to ensure that the humor 
does not take over. You are, after all, there to play a game, and 
players not directly involved in the rehash of the latest episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> or the 650th rendition of scene 14 from <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>
 might appreciate the DM stepping in to put the kibosh on excessive 
joking around (especially if the jokesters are also the players with the
 loudest voices, as they often are) and keep the game moving.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In speaking of the <b>use</b>
 of humor in a game, however, we step beyond the incidental humor that 
occurs between people to explore the designed elements of a campaign 
that are meant to be funny. It probably goes without saying that you 
don't want to build your whole campaign around running gags or a single 
titanic pun. A long-ago letter to <i>Dragon</i> magazine described the 
near-melee (in real-life terms) that ensued when, at the culmination of a
 great quest bestowed by Odin himself to find the "roots of stones," the
 players discovered a pile of rocks that recited cheerleader-type chants
 ("G-R-A-N-I-T-E! Granite, granite, allllll the WAY, HEY!"). Get it? The
 "roots" of stones. Like a "rooting section." Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 a DM, resist the temptation to let your sense of humor get in the way 
of better judgment. Be aware that some parts of the game are better 
suited for levity than others. There are different kinds of dramatic 
tension, and to disrupt the fine-tuning of these elements in the 
interest of turning everything into a slapstick routine just doesn't 
work. Don't let ill-timed humor cheapen moments where the mood should be
 one of fear, uncertainty, solemnity, worry, or excitement.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Consider, for example, the movie <i>The Princess Bride</i>,
 a favorite of many gamers for its one-liners and brilliant wordplay. At
 times, the humor stops and the tone turns serious for moments of sorrow
 or romance or triumph. The humor returns shortly, but the poignancy of 
those serious moments would be obliterated if the humor hadn't receded 
for a time. Similarly, the <b>AD&amp;D</b><b>Ravenloft</b> setting 
included rules for fear and horror checks to address situations when 
players might be joking around or might not be serious about things that
 <i>within the game</i> would or should shock and terrify their 
characters. Not all settings require that kind of rules-enforced 
atmosphere, but your game might, so you should think about when humor is
 and is not appropriate in the flow of the campaign.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So
 is there a legitimate and worthwhile way to work humor into the 
campaign at all? Yes. Humor is certainly a fun and worthy element to 
incorporate in your game. But how, and when, and with whom? I'm glad you
 asked!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">By
 and large, the best way to introduce humor into the game is through the
 NPCs in the campaign, including friendly, ambivalent, and enemy 
characters. Not every NPC need be a source of comic relief, but 
supplying your NPCs with personality, with a sense of their motivations 
and their tastes, their likes and their dislikes, can provide ample 
fodder for amusing interactions with the PCs. Bear in mind that this is a
 <i>fantasy</i> world, and that the folk who inhabit it need not all be 
normal, well-adjusted, well-mannered people. Feel free to play up 
personality elements, to make some individuals more caricatures than 
characters, to be larger than life. Memorable NPCs are those who stand 
out from the crowd in some way.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Don't overdo it -- the very concept of "normal" can lose its meaning if <i>everyone</i>
 is a freakshow inhabitant. But there is a lot of room to play within 
the broad boundaries of "normal." Supplying accents and mannerisms to 
the NPCs (including particular national, regional, local, or cultural 
traits they may share) can create an amusing picture, especially if they
 contrast in some way with a creature's appearance (e.g., a dwarven 
rogue who fancies himself a ballet dancer) or accentuate and even 
exaggerate a personality trait (e.g., a troll or half-orc with 
especially atrocious table manners or gas). Some NPCs may just be 
bizarre, like farm villagers whose cows have all died mysteriously and 
who have turned for an alternative to "hawg milk" for their calcium 
requirements. Perhaps they might offer the adventurers a sample of this 
new culinary concoction, and might even be very insistent about it!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Obviously,
 some creatures lend themselves better to humorous interaction than 
others, including humanoid NPCs from whom the party needs something 
(e.g., temple priests to get a <i>raise dead</i> spell cast, or gate 
guards to enter a city, or merchants selling/buying magic items or other
 loot). Some monsters are also more apt to transmit "interact with this 
one - it's not a random encounter" cues: fey, dragons, many 
magical/spellcasting monsters, even undead or extraplanar creatures. 
Leader-types of any variety are also much more likely to inspire 
conversation than ordinary drones.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 the party is not likely to meet the NPC in a situation where his habits
 are relevant or noticeable, you really don't need to spend a lot of 
time creating a fleshed-out personality. If the PCs' interaction with 
Nameless Orc Guard #32 will most likely consist of "see-kill-loot," they
 probably don't need to know he suffers from male-orc-pattern baldness 
and unresolved abandonment issues with his mother. On the other hand, if
 you have some reasonable expectation that they might converse with 
Grugnuk the Unhappy Midlife Crisis Orc, then by all means give the NPC 
some material to work with. I mean, how boring is it when they bother to
 take the time to talk with a bad guy, and all they get is Standard Bad 
Guy Rant/Battle Cry #486 ("Grugnuk hate HOOO-mans! DIE, DIE, DIE!")? At 
least work up some good insults for the bad guys to lob around in 
combat, if you assume swordplay is inevitable. The same principle 
applies to barkeeps, merchants, government officials, temple clerics, 
and other non-hostile priests. If you give them something tangible for a
 personality, chances are pretty good that many of the party's 
interactions with that person will end up humorous.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 can also employ humor that builds on the history of characters and 
particular situations or events that crop up repeatedly. The easiest way
 to do this is in the context of an ongoing relationship within the 
campaign in which every time the PCs runs into a certain character, they
 are in the same type of situation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><b>Friendly city magistrate:</b> "Oh, you folks again. How is life treating you? Burn down any buildings lately?"</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><b>Party that includes fire-specialist wizard:</b> "Why yes, yes we did! We're terribly sorry, but can we re-file our Urban Destruction Permit today?"</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 very predictability of a running joke is part of what makes it work. 
You can see it coming a mile away, but it still brings a warm chuckle or
 a bemused groan when it hits. Perhaps a vain male NPC is pitching woo 
at one of the party members, and each time he does another party member 
plays a prank on the would-be Valentino, messing up his coiffure and 
sending him off in shame. But he keeps coming back for more.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 running gag can sometimes be embedded in a certain person, such as a 
particular PC being a regular target of pickpockets in a certain part of
 town. Be careful to avoid the impression that you are picking on the 
character, but you can play off her comments and even her growing 
paranoia: She is so afraid of it happening that she begins to mention it
 frequently; that mention becomes its own sort of trigger, and sooner or
 later it happens again. This sort of gag is obviously more fun for the <i>other</i>
 players than for the player whose character gets "jinxed" in this way, 
but it can be maddeningly funny even for that player, as long as it is 
not overdone her character does not suffer any serious repercussions as a
 result.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Often, this type of running gag invents itself over the course of a campaign. If something - <i>anything</i>
 -- happens to a character multiple times, that character is apt to 
acquire a reputation. Maybe a character becomes charmed or confused 
repeatedly and gets grief from the others for "turning against the 
party." The gag is furthered by the player of that character insisting 
that he has no memory of anything that happened and denying that any 
such thing ever occurred. Maybe one character happens to fall into pits 
several times because of a run of low skill rolls, unlucky breaks, or 
who knows? Once a character has a reputation for such-and-such thing 
(usually a bad thing) happening to them, then each time afterwards that 
it happens only furthers the joke. Sometimes a character acquires an 
irrational fear of a certain type of creature (especially if the 
character has been killed by that creature type and then raised from the
 dead), with appropriate reactions anytime that type of creature is 
encountered in the future. These situations will crop up repeatedly 
throughout the course of a campaign and will provide many opportunities 
for all players (including the DM) to be in on the joke. Humor that 
develops organically in the course of the game is always the best 
because it does not feel forced or artificial.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 DM can set up a humorous situation which can then be milked for laughs 
repeatedly -- something as simple as a party transported to another 
world repeatedly being asked by curious locals, "You're not from around 
here, are you?", to something as elaborate as a disguised party in 
hostile territory having to go through some humorous bluffing to keep 
its cover intact. Too much DM-generated humor, however, can start to 
feel like railroading or make everything feel too similar. To keep a 
rich and robust texture in your game, you must include humor, especially
 the friendly camaraderie between players at the table and surrounding 
the characters and what naturally grows among them in the fantasy world.
 Just don't try too hard. You cannot force someone to think something is
 funny, but you can create a situation where humor is at various times a
 welcome diversion to the game and a wonderful enhancement to it.</span></p>
