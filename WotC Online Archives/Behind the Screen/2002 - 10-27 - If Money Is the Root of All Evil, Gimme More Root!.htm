<p class="size2">A game of <b>D&amp;D</b> can cover a wide variety of 
styles, but one of the inevitable constants is that somewhere along the 
line the adventurers will find themselves in possession of some loot and
 will need to decide who gets what. The variations on treasure 
distribution styles are legion, from random roll-offs to spreadsheets 
intended to make sure everyone has their shares equally shared out down 
to the copper piece. Most gaming groups have a favored style, but when 
group membership changes or when members shift from one group to 
another, they may come into conflict over their preconceived notions of 
how treasure ought to be split up. The division of treasure can have a 
significant impact on the balance of power between party members and can
 cause hard feelings if the perception (justified or not) of unfairness 
exists. Whether your character is a selfless ascetic or a greedy 
money-grubber, figuring out how to divide things fairly is essential in a
 well-run campaign.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1. <i>How often should you divide treasure?</i> Whether
 it is every time something is found, once per session, once per 
adventure (an arc of several sessions), or whatever, a regular schedule 
is less important than an agreed-upon principle.</p>
<p class="size2">2. <i>Which characters receive shares?</i> Equal shares
 for all? Splits by level, or merit bonus for exceptional contributions?
 Half shares for cohorts, or none? What about temporary NPC allies or 
for characters who are present for only part of a mission?</p>
<p class="size2">3. <i>Are money and magic treated separately?</i> If 
treated separately, it can lead to very unbalanced distribution of 
treasure. If treated as part of a common pool, you can end up with an 
accounting nightmare and useful/desirable items being sold out of the 
party to ensure fairness.</p>
<p class="size2">4. <i>How do you decide who gets an item?</i> The 
ultimate question, whether by vote, random roll, auction, or any other 
method. Who picks in what order? Do past treasure splits affect present 
shares; is there a catch-up mechanism for characters who are well behind
 other characters in terms of money and/or magic?</p>
<p class="size2">5.<i> How will you account for special cases?</i> Some 
items pertinent to particular classes are relatively more expensive than
 those for other classes. Other items are of benefit to the party as a 
whole but not really to the individual who owns or uses it. Others may 
be of limited use, but might be critically important in particular 
situations. Will some treasure be reserved in a party contingency fund? 
What allowances (if any) should the party make for treasure other than 
individual ownership?</p>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">Why is treasure division so important? In a game like <b>D&amp;D</b>,
 much of what a character is and can do is defined by his or her 
possessions, which can supplement or amplify existing character 
abilities (for example, magic weapons, stat-boosting items, and wands 
that allow extra spellcasting) or may grant entirely new capabilities, 
whether offensive, defensive, movement-related, or anything else. Even 
for those who do not seek to beef up their personal power, money and 
magic are the literal and figurative coin of the realm in amassing 
political and economic power in the game world, in supporting and 
assisting allied NPCs, or just about anything else that the character 
would like to do. Depending on the optional rules used in your campaign,
 characters may need to save money and/or items to pay for training (for
 skills, spells, feats, or level gain); a character getting shafted in 
treasure distribution may find herself frustrated or left behind as the 
rest of the party moves on up.</p>
<p class="size2">Taking the importance of treasure division as a given, 
the party needs to answer several basic questions, and it needs to think
 about them <i>before</i> heading off on the adventure so that they can 
avoid hard feelings, retroactive treasure split changes, or anything of 
that sort. <b>The first question is how often the group will stop to divide treasure.</b>
 Obviously, this is only an issue during adventures where the PCs find 
treasure; there may be sessions where the party comes up empty. More 
often than not, however, the party will come across at least some amount
 of loot, and they must decide when to split it. Perhaps they want to do
 it immediately after the encounter is over. Or perhaps they wish to 
divide it at the end of the game session. Regardless of what the 
characters may be doing at that point, the <i>players</i> may want to 
split the stuff right then, while the memory of the session is fresh, to
 make sure the treasure isn't lost in the recesses of someone's notepad.
 Maybe they will split treasure only when they return to their home 
base, whatever it might be (their favorite inn, their liege lord's 
castle, a cozy farming village). Whichever they choose, they should 
attempt to find a standard system and stick with it.</p>
<p class="size2">When the time comes to divide the kitty, the party must have some system for determining <b>how much each character will receive</b>.
 The standard is one share per character, but you could also allot 
shares by character level (on the presumption that higher-level 
characters have higher expenses and presumably brought more to the table
 during the adventure); this latter method, however, holds the danger of
 leading to an ever-widening gap between the shares of higher- and 
lower-level characters. The 1st Edition <i>Player's Handbook</i> 
suggests the possibility of setting aside an extra share to be given to 
one character (determined by party vote) who had rendered particularly 
meritorious service during that session or adventure. (I believe 
something like this is included in Kenzerco's <i>Hackmaster</i> game.) Some groups set aside a share of treasure to put into a party fund to pay for healing scrolls or potions, <i>raise dead</i>
 spells (or other restoratives), buying mounts, paying gate taxes, and 
other sorts of general party expenditures. Cohorts and other allied NPCs
 typically receive 1/2 share (or 1/2 normal based on their level), but 
some groups may demand that cohort treasure be paid out by their 
"employer" and that deals with any other types of NPCs simply be 
adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="size2">These initial two points presuppose another important 
side point, which is how to deal with the share of a character who 
misses part of an adventure. This applies most commonly when a character
 is killed or incapacitated during an adventure. It could also apply if a
 treasure division is based on the aggregate total of several gaming 
sessions. In this case, how do you adjudicate the share of a character 
who was there only part of the time? If they were there for 1 out of 3 
sessions, do they get 1/3 normal treasure? What if they happen to get 
lucky and nab the best magic item in the haul, beating out people who 
were there all three sessions -- should that be allowed? Do they get a 
shot only at items that were found while they were present? If your 
gaming group does not have perfect attendance (and no game I have ever 
played or DM'ed has for more than a few sessions in a row), this point 
moves from a technicality to a critically important clarification of how
 the campaign is going to work.</p>
<p class="size2">In figuring out the allocation of treasure shares, you also need to decide exactly <b>what a "share" is worth</b>. Is it money? Magic? Money <i>or</i>
 magic (but not both)? Some combination of money and magic equal to a 
set gp value (assuming that you assign cash values to magic items, as 
per the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>)? Some groups treat magic 
items as completely separate from money (which usually includes gems, 
jewelry, or other valuables as well as coins); that is, every character 
gets a certain share of money, and then the magic items are split among 
party members (or perhaps sold for cash if no one wants them). Getting a
 magic item does not affect your cash split in any way. Other groups 
take the opposite tack, that magic items are simply "potential cash" and
 assign every item its sale value. In this case, your share would 
include the gp value of monetary treasure and magic items (if sold). You
 use your share of the treasure to "buy" as much cash or magic as your 
share allows. If all items are gone by the time it is your turn to pick,
 your share is all money. Any items that no one can afford are assumed 
sold out of the party. In fact, in a sense this kind of system assumes 
that <i>all</i> items are always sold; it is simply a matter of whether 
they are "bought" within the party or sold out of it. This system 
attempts to balance money value with magic value; hence, a character 
whose share is expended "buying" a magic item will get no actual cash 
from the treasure.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Example:</b> Three characters find a</i> ring of protection<i></i>+1 <i>(2,000 gp), a </i>cloak of resistance<i></i>+1 <i>(1,000
 gp), and 3,000 gp in coins. Using the first system (money and magic are
 separate), each character would receive 1,000 gp in coins. They would 
then determine an order of selection (see below) where one character 
would get the ring, another the cloak, and the third nothing but his 
coins. In the second system, one character would end up with the ring 
and no money, another the cloak and 1,000 gp, and a third with no magic 
but with 2,000 gp.</i></p>
<p class="size2">The second system seems to be more fair, but I can tell
 you from long experience in a group that used it that it can create a 
bookkeeping nightmare when your treasure division is more complicated 
than the above, especially when magic value is greater than monetary 
value (meaning that those who get no magic or a lower-quality item will <i>not</i>
 be getting an even split, requiring them to take on a sort of "forced 
debt" owed them by the character(s) who got the best stuff). It also can
 create a sort of "forced homogenization" problem in that everything is 
boiled down to GUMUs (Generic Universal Monetary Units), as my players 
took to calling them. This is perfectly fine if you are running a 
standard campaign where all coinage is based on metal value, but it gets
 <i>really</i> complicated if you use national or regional coinage, 
where it matters whether your coins are from Waterdeep or Zhentil Keep 
or ancient Netheril. Likewise, this system assumes that items can be 
automatically liquidated for full normal value at any time; no haggling 
over gems or jewels or magic items or objects d'art -- everything is 
simply a numerical value placeholder. This makes for easier accounting, 
but it can weaken the roleplaying experience and the believability of 
the world.</p>
<p class="size2">This is one of many places where the feelings and 
convenience of the players may have to be weighed against the imagined 
actions of their characters, and each group will need to decide for 
itself how far it is willing to go along that line. Do your gems have 
type and color, or are they just six 500 gp gems (worth precisely 500 gp
 at every market from Nyrond to Netheril)? This same point was discussed
 in an earlier column in terms of roleplaying out day-to-day living 
expenses or allowing players to use the "Variant Rule: Upkeep" from the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>,
 and it really depends on what your players like to do. If they are 
willing to put in the time and effort into keeping track of everything, 
it <i>could</i> be a great addition to the richness of the campaign; if 
they don't, it will bore them and you to tears and waste precious gaming
 time counting beans.</p>
<p class="size2">The above four points deal with when you divide 
treasure, who gets a share, whether they get a full share if they 
weren't there the whole time, and what a share is really worth. We can 
now deal with the real brass tack of the whole situation: <b>How do we decide who gets what?</b>
 The classic method is to roll randomly. Either you, as the DM, roll 
from a list of characters, or each player rolls and each player picks 
starting from the highest result to the lowest result. The 1st Edition <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 suggested that you allow characters to roll once for each experience 
level and to keep the best roll, and I have seen groups allow characters
 to add their Charisma bonus to the roll (another way to try to make 
Charisma helpful, presumably in you charming/swindling your comrades 
into giving you the best stuff, which I suppose makes at least a teensy 
bit of sense). Even then, do you go highest to lowest, and then back up 
to the top of the list again, or do you go highest to lowest and then 
reverse order (lowest to highest) for the second round of picks?</p>
<p class="size2">If you don't like the whole dicing for picks idea, you 
could roleplay the division of treasure and try to find the best fit for
 each item within the group. Some items are obviously best suited for 
certain characters, but unfortunately a great many items are equally 
desirable to and useful for any kind of character. While potentially 
very satisfying and appropriate to the game and genre, this system 
breaks down very easily unless your players know and trust each other. 
Even if you do not use this as the basic model for assigning items, the 
party may wish to assign certain strictures or rules about treasure 
division -- a sort of party contract or covenant. For example, at low 
levels (when magic items are relatively few and far between), the party 
might agree that a character who already has a magic item (a permanent 
item; single-use items shouldn't really be counted for this purpose) 
cannot choose another one if there are other party members who do not 
have one, unless, of course, none of the others wants that particular 
item. If the character wants the new item more than the old one, then he
 or she must put the old item back into the party kitty if he or she is 
able to get the new item.</p>
<p class="size2">Another method is selling items by auction, with items 
going to the highest bidder within the party. The winning bid is then 
distributed among the other party members (including dividing up any 
magic items offered up in that bid). If you are dividing treasure 
acquired over a long series of sessions, you might allocate picks based 
on each character's XP award as a percentage of the party's total 
experience points. This has the benefit of reflecting not merely the 
number of sessions attended by the player (assuming you hold back XP 
awards from those characters not present) but also the relative 
difficulty and/or productivity of that session. This system is less well
 suited to the current edition of <b>D&amp;D</b> than previous editions,
 however, given that XP awards are now scaled by character level and 
thus would skew such results in favor of lower-level characters. Of 
course, that might be a desirable result in a mixed-level party since it
 can help to bring lower-level characters up to par with their 
higher-level compatriots, but that is an aesthetic decision best left to
 an individual group.</p>
<p class="size2">Finally, the party must decide <b>what to do with unwanted items,</b>
 or items that perhaps someone might want or find useful, but wouldn't 
necessarily want to spend a share of their treasure to acquire. 
Sometimes this might be an item that is only useful in rare 
circumstances but might be <i>very</i> useful if those rare 
circumstances came up, so the party might want to save it for a rainy 
day, or maybe the item is a weapon with a high bonus and a nice special 
ability, but not a type that any of the characters could or would 
regularly use. More often, these might be items that are greatly useful 
for the party (for example, a <i>wand of knock</i> or <i>staff of curing</i>
 or any number of scrolls) but not really all that useful for the person
 who bought the item. The party must decide whether it is willing to 
sift these items out of the treasure pile, not to sell them off or to 
force anyone in the party to take them, but to keep them as "party 
items" to be used for the general good of whomever in the party might 
need them.</p>
<p class="size2">Just like in real life, it is often the "wallet issues"
 that really get to the heart of whether a person is satisfied with the 
way things are going. Treasure division is necessarily a player issue 
first and foremost, and your job as DM should be to make suggestions and
 to help settle disputes, but not to dictate what goes where. You have 
enough control over treasure as it is, since you are the one who selects
 what will (or at least might) be found, when, and where (and you should
 at least try to seed some items of interest suitable for all of the 
characters in the campaign). Butting in and deciding where it goes 
inside the confines of the party crosses the railroad line and should be
 avoided. At the same time, you will usually end up being the primary 
recordkeeper when it comes to treasure division (especially if one of 
the more complicated systems is adopted); you should decide how much 
extra workload you are willing to undertake and should certainly have 
input on the system to be adopted insofar as it affects your 
responsibilities. In any event, remember that treasure in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 is a reward for a job well done; the battle should be over when 
treasure is divided -- it should not cause a new battle to begin! With a
 little thought and some shared effort by you and the players, you can 
make sure to keep it that way.</p>
