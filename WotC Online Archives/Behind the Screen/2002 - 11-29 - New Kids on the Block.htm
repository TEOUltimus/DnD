<p class="size2">In every hobby, every pastime, every area of interest, 
you have people who know the ins and outs to differing degrees. Hobbies,
 however, are not purely insular pursuits -- if they were, they would 
die off along with their fans since the knowledge would never be passed 
along. Just think how different the gaming table would sound if no one 
passed along TV and movie quotes at every session! Soon no one would 
remember that <i>Hawk the Slayer</i> or <i>The Sword and the Sorcerer</i> or the <i>Wizards &amp; Warriors</i>
 movies and shows ever existed . . . well, maybe that would be a good 
thing, but you get the idea! The point is that a hobby must propagate 
itself to survive, grow, and thrive, and to do so it must be open to new
 "members of the club."</p>

<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE:</b></p>
<p class="size2">1.<i> Spread the word.</i> Say it loud: You're a gamer 
and proud! It's like the slogan for the Masons: "To be one, ask one." 
Would-be gamers need to know you are one before they'll know to ask you 
about the hobby.</p>
<p class="size2">2.<i> Make them feel welcome.</i> You'd think this 
would be obvious, but gamers can be bad about overdoing the in-jokes, 
arcane rules citations, and conversational habits that can make it hard 
to break in. Extend yourself a little, and it can go a long way.</p>
<p class="size2">3.<i> Lend a hand, but don't kill with kindness.</i> 
New players appreciate some help from DMs and players alike, but in the 
end they want to decide things for themselves and to shape their 
character and their style to their vision, not yours.</p>
<p class="size2">4.<i> Don't rob from the blind.</i> Don't take 
advantage of a new player's inexperience. This seems obvious, but it 
happens, and not just in the comic books. I'm not even going to get into
 actual player hazing -- if it still exists (you never know, it might).</p>
<p class="size2">5.<i> Keep 'em talking.</i> Talk to new players about 
their experiences. Find out what worked for them and what did not. Try 
to work with them in helping to grow in knowledge and skill.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">Gamers enjoy their hobby, and people who enjoy their 
hobby ought to feel proud enough to spread the word. A certain subset of
 the population will get the heebie-jeebies still (or try to give them 
to you) if you talk about gaming, but if you know that line of reasoning
 is a crock, then you've nothing to be embarrassed about when you read 
your latest supplement or module in public. Look, a pretty large number 
of gamers are <i>already</i> categorized as nerds, eggheads, bookworms, 
or weirdos (myself included), so it's not like someone knowing you're a 
gamer, too, is going to give you a bad rap you don't already have! You 
probably shouldn't wear your "Slavegirls of Gor" T-shirt to a dress 
formal, but when you talk about or read or web-chat or whatever about 
gaming, you are really "advertising" for the hobby. <b>D&amp;D</b> and other RPGs are not quite the front-page fad that they were twenty years ago, so <b>potential gamers out there might not hear about the hobby if you don't tell them about it</b>.
 This is hardly a call to arms for a recruitment drive of new gamers 
(though Kenzerco has advocated something like this, along with National 
Gamer's Day, in their <i>Knights of the Dinner Table</i> magazine), but 
if you think it's important for the hobby to grow, then you might feel a
 twinge of responsibility for being part of that effort.</p>
<p class="size2">If you do happen to encounter an interested soul, 
invite him or her to your game, or refer the person to another game that
 might fit his or her needs better. Maybe this person lives on the other
 side of the city you live in; he or she <i>could</i> come to your game,
 but it might be a long drive. If you know of a game or comic shop that 
hosts games or a group that meets over there, put the person in touch 
with these folks. A number of gamer registries on the Internet can help 
hobbyists find one another. Personal contacts are best, however, and a 
warm handshake and a smile are more likely to stoke interest than a URL 
or a phone number.</p>
<p class="size2">Once a new gamer shows up, help the person get 
acquainted. You won't find this an instantaneous process; obviously, you
 can't just show up and be instant friends with a bunch of people you've
 never met (but who already know one another). You and your fellow 
gamers can certainly make an effort to make sure the new person feels 
included. You will find this especially important if the new player is 
different in some way from the rest of the group -- perhaps he is a 
teenager in a group of thirtysomethings, she is a woman in a group full 
of men, a Christian or Jew or Muslim in a group of atheists/agnostics, 
an African American in a group full of Caucasians, and on and on. You 
will find this no different from any other group situation when someone 
new enters, regardless of how similar or different they are to the 
people already there in the group. Sometimes it may be awkward and feel 
forced. It takes some time to learn one another's reactions and patterns
 of interaction. The important thing is simply to be considerate -- 
don't talk past the person like they aren't there or interrupt them when
 they talk. <b>Avoid constant in-jokes and obscure references that may make the new player feel left out. </b>Most
 importantly, realize that you're not dealing with only a new person in a
 group of people, but it is a new gamer in the midst of experienced 
gamers -- a double whammy.</p>
<p class="size2">Setting interpersonal dynamics aside for a moment (and 
since that point has been covered in previous columns), it requires a 
careful hand to initiate a new player into the rules of the game. Part 
of making a person feel welcome is making sure that you or others don't 
make them feel like an idiot or a millstone around the party's neck. 
Even if the new person does something that the experienced players think
 is silly, dumb, or against the logic of the game, you need to have some
 courtesy and sensitivity in explaining the mechanics of the rules and 
the probable outcomes of decisions the player might make. The current 
edition of <b>D&amp;D</b> is generally much more intuitive than its 
predecessors and therefore less confusing in that regard, but you still 
have a broad range of choices to make from what can be a bewildering 
array of options. Even experienced players may have a hard time keeping 
track and it can certainly overwhelm new players. A helping hand from 
the DM or other players can be of considerable assistance.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Lending a hand is potentially dangerous, however, 
because you or your other players could find it too easy to start 
leading that player and character around by the putative "helping hand,"</b>
 to the point where the new player feels that others are leading around 
or steering his or her character. When the essential point of the game 
is to envision a fantastic character and imagine the adventures you want
 him or her to pursue, what could be more maddening than to discover 
that you feel you have no control over what he or she does? If those 
around you constantly tell you what to do, however solicitous they might
 be in their hearts, you could feel much more like a leashed poodle than
 an aspiring hero. Like a child with a science fair project, the new 
player would be happy to have your <i>help</i>, but he or she probably 
doesn't want you to just do it for him or her. You may do better than 
the person, and the person may even get a better grade, but the whole 
experience becomes an empty, powerless, unrewarding, and unsatisfying 
one, and one the player probably won't repeat if given the option. A 
very fine line exists between helpful hints and patronizing or even 
domineering lead-by-the-nose henpecking, and you must tread carefully 
when helping a new player get his or her feet wet in the hobby.</p>
<p class="size2">You should know that not all players (or, vicariously, 
their characters) have the best interests of new players (and their 
characters) at heart. All players do not have (or do not perceive 
themselves as having) an equal investment in the presence or 
participation of the new player. <b>Sometimes such players find themselves tempted to take advantage of new players,</b>
 their incomplete understanding of the rules, and perhaps guilelessness.
 They may try to trick them out of their share of treasure or into 
making other sorts of unfavorable deals. One humorous example is from 
the "Black Hands" gaming group (featured intermittently in the <i>Knights of the Dinner Table</i>
 comic): a "character insurance fund" into which a new player's 
character pays to finance raising from the dead; upon his or her death, 
however, the PCs in on the scam simply pocket the money instead. 
Obviously, this idea is caricatured for humorous effect, but you as the 
DM should keep an ear out in the interests of the new player and should 
feel free to nix anything too outrageous. As with other players, you as 
the DM cannot hold the player's hand throughout the campaign or dictate 
his or her actions, but you should at least keep a watchful eye on 
things to make sure no one is trying to get one over on the new person.</p>
<p class="size2">A final point about new gamers is that you can't just invite them, play, and then let them wander off. All players <i>should</i>
 have some interest in new players and their adjustment to the group, 
but you as the DM have a unique responsibility to talk to the new player
 about his or her experience, to gauge how well he or she assimilated 
the rules of the game and at the same time entered into the social 
patterns of the group. <b>It helps to debrief the new person</b> and try
 to figure out what he or she enjoyed, what he or she didn't, which 
parts of the game and the situation felt comfortable and which still 
seemed difficult. It may be that the new person was just trying the game
 on a lark, and it could very well turn out that he or she didn't like 
it. Thank the person for coming, let him or her know the door is always 
open if he or she wants to try it again, and bid the person adieu. Maybe
 the person had personality issues with one or more of the players (or 
maybe even with you); the new person might have enjoyed the game itself,
 but maybe not the interpersonal end of things. Again, sometimes things 
just don't work out. Or maybe it's love at first sight for this person 
and your game. If so, be ready to help him or her along in becoming a 
part of the group and in becoming enough of a student of the game to 
make the ideas of heroic fantasy inside his or her mind find expression 
in the game.</p>
<p class="size2">I should point out that all of the above assumes a 
certain scenario -- an established gaming group comprised of experienced
 gamers trying to incorporate a single new player, both new to them and 
new to gaming. Plenty of other possibilities exist, of course, where 
integration of a new person could come about:</p>
<p class="size2">1. A new DM judges within an established gaming group 
(once a player, now sliding behind the screen). The former DM might have
 left the group, might have shifted over to playing, or may be running a
 campaign that alternates with this one.</p>
<p class="size2">2. A new DM from outside the group sets up the game. This is far less common than in the old days of <b>D&amp;D</b>, when a group of younger players would sometimes seek out an older gamer to run a game for them.</p>
<p class="size2">3. A new player who is familiar with the rules and 
system used in the group (aside from perhaps a handful of house rules) 
joins in.</p>
<p class="size2">4. A new player who hasn't played <b>D&amp;D</b> (or whatever game the group happens to play) but who is experienced with gaming in other systems joins the group.</p>
<p class="size2">5. An entirely new gaming group forms (whether all experienced players, all new players, or a mix).</p>
<p class="size2">It may be that your gaming group remains very stable 
for years at a time, and you never really have to deal with this 
problem. Some folks are perfectly happy gaming in their homes with a 
small group of old friends, where the game is really as much an excuse 
to get together and socialize as it is for trying to "accomplish" 
something within the game. For most gamers, however, campaigns usually 
last less than a year, and changing work and school schedules or life 
situations can cause their gaming group to morph and change over the 
years. Sooner or later you may be faced with the prospect of having to 
find new people to game with, and how you deal with these "new kids on 
the block" will be much less about the global idea of promoting the 
gaming hobby and much more about finding some space and some friends for
 your own personal game.</p>
