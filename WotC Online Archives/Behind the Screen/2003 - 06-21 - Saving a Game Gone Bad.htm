<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We've
 all seen columns about games gone wrong, so in the spirit of honest 
imitation I thought it was time I offered a few ideas of my own about 
ways a game can self-destruct. We've already talked about things that 
can and do go wrong <i>outside</i> of the game itself, such as the<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20030425a"> intrusion of real-life interpersonal relationships </a>and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20030516a">attempted humor gone bad</a>.

 Figure out what makes that character so much tougher than everyone 
else. Can a min-maxing player tone it down? Does one 
super-weapon/item/ability make him ultravicious, and can you take it 
away without totally screwing the character?</span></p>

 everyone adjust their characters to a more appropriate wealth level?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Problem #3: The entire party is DEAD.</i>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 one character becomes head and shoulders more powerful than the others,
 problems ensue. This situation usually arises in one of two ways: (1) 
you have an expert min-maxing powergamer in your midst (the guilty may 
raise their hands along with me), or (2) you give out a magic item that 
is either more powerful/useful than you thought it was or simply more 
powerful than anything anyone else has. Unbalanced parties happen 
frequently at low levels, when magic items are apt to be unequally 
distributed and when class differences are magnified, but it is a much 
more bothersome problem as levels go up, because it is a cumulative 
problem. That is, it builds on itself in terms of sheer killpower (the 
more powerful character often tends to get progressively more powerful, 
with the gap between him and the other characters getting larger), and 
it gets progressively more annoying as it keeps going on and on. After a
 while, the other players start to feel like their characters are just 
second-rate henchmen of the supercharacter. This state also makes it 
difficult to create encounters that will be a challenge for the 
supercharacter without wiping out the wimpier characters, or suitable 
for the others without being a cakewalk for the supercharacter.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Solving
 this problem is tricky. Many min-maxers do what they do by second 
nature -- they almost literally can't help themselves. They also may 
derive some of their own enjoyment of the game from finding the best 
ways to work the system, so to tell them to just stop doing it may 
impede their enjoyment and engagement. You could tell them to put their 
energies into roleplaying and other elements of gaming, but many 
min-maxers already do that -- being a powergamer doesn't preclude being a
 roleplayer or having a well-rounded character. If it is some specific 
class ability or spell that helps them be ultravicious, you might just 
tone down the offending game mechanic. If it is a magic item, you might 
likewise re-engineer it to be less insane or just remove it entirely. 
Though these solutions seem simple enough, it is hard to implement them 
without the player feeling that his or her character is getting screwed.
 You might offer some other kickback to the character, a "trade-in" for 
something else useful. Or you might just point out to the player the 
fact that the supercharacter is annoying everyone else. Some players 
might recognize the problem themselves and come forward with 
suggestions.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>We're in the money!</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sometimes
 instead of one supercharacter, the entire party has gotten just way too
 much loot and magic stuff. All the PCs are superheroic, ratcheting up 
the entire power level of the campaign. This situation isn't 
automatically a problem if you are comfortable running things that way, 
but it creates complications with the intended scaling of the game and 
figuring out appropriate challenges and rewards. If you keep giving 
treasure, the problem will just keep getting worse, <i>and</i> most the 
stuff will just get sold for money because the characters already have 
the best equipment around. A game like this usually ends up in an arms 
race of insane skill checks, save DCs, Armor Class, and attack rolls. 
Everyone either fails all the time or succeeds all the time. It's an 
intense way to game, but it's kind of like bingeing on candy after 
Halloween or Easter. It's not very fulfilling and leaves you a little 
queasy at the end.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fixing
 this situation is much harder than fixing one supercharacter, because 
it affects the whole campaign. You could just stop giving out treasure 
for a long time, until the PCs' loot quotient balances out with their 
level. That's not too appealing, though, because adventuring is as much 
about the looting as it is about hacking, exploring, kingdom-building, 
NPC interactions and all the rest. Eliminating treasure from the 
campaign takes away part of what adventuring is all about. You could 
give out teeny-tiny treasure awards, but that is hardly better than 
nothing at all. Either way, it may also take a long time for levels to 
catch up with loot, and what do you do in the meantime?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As an alternative solution, consider recalibrating the possessions of <i>everyone</i> in the campaign. You <i>must</i><b></b>discuss
 a campaign-wide "reboot" like this with the players. They may have 
built their characters around particular items, and you shouldn't just 
take stuff away without offering the chance to adjust the way characters
 were created and developed, or even for a player to create an entirely 
new character if her vision of her current character is too deeply 
enmeshed with the PC's items to want to do a full-on redesign. There is 
no easy or even appealing solution for fixing a campaign-wide problem 
like this, and hitting people in the wallet always hurts, but your 
campaign will probably be healthier and more enjoyable, even if you have
 to blow most of a game session to do it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Ha-ha-ha-haaaaa . . . WIPEOUT!</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 anyone too young to remember, those were the only lyrics to a classic 
surf-rock song; the rest was all instrumental, with a great guitar riff.
 In this case, though, what I'm talking about is the dreaded TPK, the 
Total Party Kill. Sometimes the dice just don't fall for the players, 
and your own are on a hot roll. Sometimes the players do something 
really, really dumb. Sometimes you underestimate how viciously effective
 a particular strategy or situation is going to be, or you overestimate 
the PCs' ability to deal with challenges. Sometimes all it takes is one 
lucky blow or unlucky save to turn the tide of the battle and change a 
tough fight into an absolute rout or, in the worst case scenario, 
complete annihilation.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What
 do you do when the adventuring party gets turned into Trollburger 
Helper? Just as the players have put time, energy, and effort into 
crafting their characters, you have done much the same with your 
campaign. You have orchestrated a framework of challenges for them to 
negotiate, allies to make, items to find, and on down the list. If the 
entire party croaks, what happens to your campaign? Well, you have 
several alternatives:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>The preemptive fudge:</b>
 The easiest solution is to fudge the die rolls or alter the game 
situation (e.g., reduce the hit points of monsters or the save DCs of 
some attack or trap) to ensure that a TPK never occurs in the first 
place. If done with subtlety, the players never need know. (They may 
guess that you are fudging on their behalf, but they'll be happy enough 
for their characters to survive that they probably won't mind too much.)
 You really have to be careful with this, though, because if the players
 suspect that you'll never really let them die, the tension that comes 
from riding the edge of danger vanishes from the campaign and it can 
easily lapse into boredom-ville.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>A ghost of a chance:</b>
 Let the dead characters remain in existence as shades of their former 
selves. You might construct an adventure where their restless spirits 
have the opportunity to possess some other creatures and try to recover 
their bodies and/or their stuff and get raised, or maybe just complete 
their original task in their new bodies, allowing their spirits to find 
rest after a job well done. </span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">[<i>Editor's note:</i> You can now run a whole afterlife campaign with the just released</span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#ff0000"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/885660000">Ghostwalk</a></i> campaign setting.

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Game over, man. GAME OVER!</b>
 The most common solution is to just create new characters. This might 
mean starting an entirely new campaign with 1st-level characters. Or you
 might create characters of levels and capabilities similar to the 
originals, whose mission is to find out what happened to the original 
characters and either bring them back or complete their task for them. 
Some players create backup characters just in case something happens to 
their main characters. If the DM allows it, the new characters might be 
proteges, family members, or other associates of the old characters, 
giving them a natural interest in following in their footsteps and 
investigating their fate.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 real heart of the matter is that when a campaign spins out of control, 
you have to decide whether it's worth saving. It may be too far gone to 
rescue without changes so massive that you may as well start over. It 
may also have run its course in terms of the fun and desire for the 
players to keep running those same characters -- they actually may 
welcome a fresh start. You might even want to play for a while instead 
of DMing, and a "broken" game might offer a good opportunity to change 
over. If you want to keep up the current campaign, though, you need to 
take a hard look at the way you've been doing things and how you and the
 players want to fix them.</span></p>
