<p align="LEFT"><i>Aliens -- sci-fi.</i> "Alien" just means different. 
The alien could be anything strange, foreign, and unusual, even other 
humans (usually from another continent), but the idea that they have 
spies, infiltrators, and turncoats working for them will add greatly to 
the drama.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Introduce the invasion subtly.</i> Reveal clues and 
information in bits and rumors. Leave the PCs to wonder what is really 
going on. A sudden, shocking appearance of an invasion force could be 
interesting in its own way, but you're usually better off setting the 
stage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Know what the invaders are, but don't make their nature immediately obvious to the PCs.</i>
 Even if the PCs see the creatures, they must learn where the invasion 
comes from, what its motivations and goals are, and what the enemy can 
do.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Paranoia is your friend!</i> When you create an 
atmosphere of real danger, of an alien influence that corrupts, you 
cause the PCs to question whom they can trust -- even one another. Even 
in open invasion, who is really on their side?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Decide when the invaders will strike overtly.</i> How
 long until the invasion happens openly? Use a set time schedule to give
 the PCs a sense of things happening all around them that they must 
react to, rather than having things happen only in relation to the 
party's actions. (Though, of course, PC actions can and should influence
 the course of events).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Know your players.</i> I've said it before and I'll say it again: Make sure your players are open to the kind of game you have in mind.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Icky green goo? Physical corruption? Mind control? 
Sounds like standard fare more in the sci-fi and horror genre than 
fantasy, but <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20040125a">last month's column</a>
 about cross-genre gaming suggested, there's certainly nothing wrong 
with importing good ideas that are a little outside the standard fantasy
 box: in this case, a mysterious enemy -- something alien and very much 
hostile.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An "alien invasion" is not an idea restricted to space 
mutants. If you want to stay with a sci-fi angle, you could also go with
 a robotic or cyborg-type menace (such as the Borg of <i>Star Trek</i>),
 but that's not the only kind of alien invasion you can develop into a 
story arc. "Alien" just means different, foreign, strange, unfamiliar. 
In a pure <b>D&amp;D</b> game, an alien invasion might involve an 
irruption of demonic or diabolic influence, leading to possession, 
fiendish diseases, corruption (physical, spiritual, or moral), 
interbreeding, and direct demonic/diabolic attacks. You might cook up a 
similar concept with undead (especially vampires, ghosts, or liches), or
 with lycanthropes or other shapechangers. You don't even have to go 
outside the human species -- the invaders could be an alien culture of 
humans elsewhere on the planet. The <b>Forgotten Realms</b> saga of the Tuigan Horde was just this sort of storyline, and the Seanchan of the <i>Wheel of Time</i>
 are much the same. They are human, but their culture, mindset, and 
"feel" are very different (and in some way very opposed) to what the PCs
 consider normal. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Running an alien invasion scenario involves several 
layers. First, the PCs need to know that the threat exists. Eddie has 
been dropping hints in the campaign since they came back from their 
little world-hopping adventure arc. The heroes thought everything was 
solved -- their enemy defeated, the gate sealed -- but something came 
through the other way, and only now is the party becoming aware of it. 
Strange behavior. Little bits of weirdness dropped in. And now the 
mysterious green goo. Arphaxad was the first to notice it, but she fell 
under the influence of the alien entity, which made her forget what she 
had seen until she saw it again. When she started to spill the beans, 
the alien reasserted control.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once the PCs discover the aliens' existence, they need 
to figure out what they are up against. So far, they have only bits of 
information. Somehow they must learn more. Perhaps Rashean's bardic 
skills can dredge up a few stories or legends about alien life forms. 
Maybe the green goo is like a seed pod that is implanted by the alien 
enemy (which might be one creature, or a host of them) to corrupt 
creatures into its service and eventually into new protoplasmic aliens. 
The alien incursion is like a stealthy virus that builds into a plague.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This kind of infiltration creates an "enemy within" 
atmosphere. The party suspects that Arphaxad has been infected, but has 
someone else as well? Has the little halfling passed it on to another 
party member? Are they all infected? If they head to the city to look 
for healing, how will they know who has been infected? Whom can they 
tell? Who will believe them? Does healing the corruption endanger the 
healer? Is an infected party member actually working for the enemy? Real
 paranoia and fear can result when characters don't know whom to trust.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If that approach is too melodramatic for your players, 
or if you just want to convert that suspense into a different kind of 
tension, move things along from infiltration and corruption and leap 
right into open invasion. Just after the party gets back to the Free 
City of Gath and finds that a <i>heal</i> spell is sufficient to restore
 Arphaxad to wholeness of body and mind, the alien menace reveals itself
 in open war upon the world, bringing forth its own alien hordes as well
 as its corrupted minions! At this point, Arphaxad and her friends don't
 need to worry about whether the enemy's existence is a secret. Now it 
is all about facing down an enemy that knows neither pain nor fear, only
 hunger and hate. Of course, even in open war the "enemy within" concept
 applies, as those who fight are always at risk of being corrupted and 
turned to the side of the enemy. Your ally today may be your enemy 
tomorrow!</p>
<p align="LEFT">An interesting tweak to throw into an invasion by a 
truly alien Other is the idea of strange alliances against a common 
enemy. Perhaps the Northern League Orcs and the Free Cities of the Coast
 will put aside their enmity to unite against the alien hordes that 
threaten to overwhelm them both. Or maybe they won't, unless Rashean can
 serve as a diplomat from the Free Cities to make assurances, offer 
payment, or perform some sort of service to the league. Even if they do 
ally, you still have the fear of betrayal among ancient enemies, and 
maybe the enemy, however alien it may be, is cunning enough to arrange 
an incident of some sort to drive a wedge between those who resist it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The idea of an invasion is different from a campaign set
 against a backdrop of war between known elements in the world (though 
if you set it up right, you can accomplish many of the things). It is a 
glimpse into something from beyond, something unfriendly, and something 
that is coming to get you! This kind of a campaign has a bit of a 
desperate feel to it, so if your players want to spend a lot of time 
researching spells and making magic items and building kingdoms or 
business guilds and that sort of thing, it's probably not a good idea. 
With few exceptions, Rashean, Mikko, Arphaxad, and Melantha aren't very 
tied down in that fashion, so it's a good fit for them. If your group is
 similar, your characters -- and players -- might thrive under the 
constant sense of impending danger and urgency.</p>
