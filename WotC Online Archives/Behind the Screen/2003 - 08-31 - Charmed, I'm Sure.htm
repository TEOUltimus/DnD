<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Consider these points regarding charms in your campaign.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Charms and language.</i>
 Most charms have limited use if you don't possess a lot of language 
ability. If you plan to do a lot of charming, build your character 
accordingly.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Charms and campaign style.</i>
 DMs and players should talk about campaign style and what they expect. 
Like illusions, charms require a lot of subjectivity in their use, so 
you need to know ahead of time whether and in what circumstances a charm
 is going to be effective.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>What does it mean to be a friend?</i>
 If a controlled creature is "on your side," what does that mean? How 
much will it really put itself out to help you? Obvious self-destruction
 is not allowed, but the target has to be willing to put itself out for 
you to prove itself a friend. Will it turn on its old allies to help 
you?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>How reasonable do you need to be?</i>
 When commanding or requesting something from a controlled creature, how
 much can you get away with? If you're too restrictive, control spells 
become useless; too permissive, and they are all-powerful.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>What happens when the charm is offline?</i>
 Do charmed or dominated creatures recognize their condition? Can they 
reveal their condition to others? Probably no in both cases, but what <i>do</i> they do when you are not actively engaged with them? Do they follow you around like a puppy? Return to their normal activities?</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>"C'mon, Dave, doesn't it have to be a</i> reasonable<i>
 suggestion?" countered Ally. "Why is this guy just going to turn on his
 boss and let us into the fortress he's supposed to be guarding? And 
besides, aren't you forgetting the little fact that he's a troll? He's 
chaotic evil -- he's totally going to screw us as soon as the suggestion
 wears off."</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>"That's
 the beauty of it -- he's chaotic evil. It's perfectly in keeping with 
his character to betray his boss in order to get ahead. He's just 
passing the buck on dealing with us for someone else down the line."</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>"Eddie,
 Arphaxad the Mighty says less yak, more hack," Samantha cut in. "This 
charm-and-suggest plan might work, but it's got too many variables. 
Still, it's nothing a nice</i> explosive cascade<i> right up the six-hole can't cure! Eat hot nuclear death, troll-boy!"</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>"Yes!" Michael almost shouted. "Mikko moves in to flank and sneak attack if there's anything left!"</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Eddie could only sigh as he reached for the dice. Another roleplaying opportunity up in smoke. Literally.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Some of the trickiest spells to run in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game are those that involve mental control or influence. Something like <i>fear</i> or <i>sleep </i>-- that's easy. You cast the spell, and those who fail do whatever the spell says. A spell like <i>magic jar</i> (or a ghost's <i>malevolence</i>
 ability) grants total body control, so again there is no problem. It's 
all those other spells in between that require a lot of interpretation 
and, from the point of view of players like Michael and Samantha, make 
them more trouble than they're worth.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Spells like <i>charm</i> and <i>dominate</i>
 depend heavily on the type of campaign and how a DM uses them. In some 
games they will be indispensable, while in others they will be useless. 
Many creatures are immune to mind-affecting spells, but the larger 
barrier is the fact that these are language-dependent spells. If most 
creatures in the campaign speak a common language, this is no problem, 
but if the party travels extensively or meets a variety of creatures 
(including creatures that have no language), PCs may be unable to get a 
controlled creature to do much of anything.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Rashean might sing or play his harp and use bardic music to <i>fascinate</i>
 any kind of creature, but his best Perform skill is in oratory. Should 
that work on a creature with no common language? Maybe. In any case, he 
speaks Giant; he can converse with the troll and try to use <i>suggestion</i>
 on him. But what if he runs into a dragon or xorn or winter wolf? 
Should you have to know almost every language in the game world just to 
be a well-rounded charmer? Add to that the fact that Speak Language is a
 cross-class skill for <i>every</i> class except bards, so learning a 
ton of languages can get very expensive in skill points. That hardly 
seems fair, especially when every monster in the game understands <i>fireball</i> and <i>magic missile</i> with complete clarity!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">To be really effective, <i>charm</i>-type
 spells require advance knowledge of what you are going to face (so that
 you know it's something you can communicate with) or else expenditure 
of character resources -- in skill points to learn languages, or in 
other spells and magic items that will let you talk to the things you 
charm. A bard or sorcerer gets so few spells that you almost have to 
choose whether you are going to go whole hog into <i>charm</i>-type 
spells or else avoid them entirely. If you're going to spend some of 
your spell choices on those kinds of spells you'd better be sure you'll 
be able to use them, because you aren't going to have a lot of 
alternatives to fall back on. For Arphaxad's repertoire, Samantha 
decided to avoid such spells entirely because she saw them as a losing 
proposition -- just too much to do to make them pay off compared to 
developing a more combat-focused sorcerer. Bards have class abilities 
that overlap (or even duplicate) charm effects, and it was easier for 
David to build Rashean toward being able to make good use of charms, but
 even for him it is hard to prepare for every eventuality. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Ultimately, the usefulness of <i>charm</i>-type
 spells depends on the DM. Eddie would like to see conversation and 
interaction with NPCs along with the action and problem-solving elements
 of the campaign, and has set up the campaign to provide opportunities. 
If most encounters in your campaign begin with the words "roll for 
initiative," then you probably don't need to bother much with charms. 
They aren't useless in combat: A <i>charm</i> or <i>dominate</i> spell 
can make a creature friendly toward you, so even if you can't talk to it
 at least it won't attack you (and it might even fight to protect you if
 someone else tries to attack you). Still, that's not much to bet on.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 real trick with spells like this is exactly how far you can push them. 
What are the true limits on your control? Ally's questions are valid 
ones. How can you be sure what your "new best friend" will be willing to
 do? What is a reasonable suggestion? A <i>charmed</i> creature "perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way," but what does that mean? Is it like an unlimited-use <i>suggestion</i> ability for as long as the creature remains <i>charmed</i>?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">For
 that matter, what does being "friendly" mean to a troll? Does it depend
 on the creature's alignment, or its own personality? Alignment does 
help determine how a creature understands the world and other creatures 
it interacts with, but each target is an individual so you may get 
wildly different results depending on the kind of creature you charm. 
The best interpretation is probably that the effect imposes a uniform 
kind of "friendliness" on the target. Under the Diplomacy skill, the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 states that a friendly creature "wishes you well" and will "chat, 
advise, offer limited help, or advocate" for you. That doesn't sound 
much like it would actually take up arms to defend you, which would be 
more like a helpful attitude -- someone who will protect, back up, heal,
 or aid you -- but the spell description states that you might get a <i>charmed</i> creature to "hold back an onrushing red dragon." That's some kind of friend!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Even if a creature is being your friend, you have to determine how much initiative it takes in doing things on your behalf. A <i>charmed</i>
 creature sees you as a friend, but how much will it put itself out for 
you, and when will it take your lead? What will it volunteer for your 
use, and what will it willingly give up at your request? You can give it
 orders by winning an opposed Charisma check; should you be able to 
augment this with a Bluff or Diplomacy check (to make the order seem 
more reasonable or appealing)? If you don't give it direct orders or if 
it ignores the ones you do give, what does it do?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Even with <i>dominate</i>,
 which allows you to specify the actions a creature takes (and can 
partially overcome language barriers), how far can you go? What kinds of
 things qualify as "actions against its nature" for the subject, 
granting new saves? In a lot of cases, you could argue that almost any 
command you gave a dominated creature would entail a new save. Say a 
vampire showed up while the party was battling the troll, <i>dominated</i>
 Melantha, and told her to come away with it. Wouldn't that be 
abandoning the party in the midst of combat -- something against her 
nature? Commanding the <i>dominated</i> person to fight for you would 
almost certainly be a violation of its basic nature. Just telling it to 
stand there and do nothing? Much the same. How often does it get a new 
save? Every time it does something against its nature? Every round it is
 forced to continue the activity? If the DM wants to undermine the 
person using <i>domination,</i> it is all too easy, and that potential is what dissuades a lot of players from even bothering with spells like this.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">You still have all the questions of whether people remember what happens to them while they are <i>charmed</i> or <i>dominated</i>,
 of whether they are responsible in any way for their actions while 
controlled (especially for alignment-relevant classes), and how easy it 
is for people to tell that they are being controlled. If Rashean had 
managed to get his plan to work, to <i>suggest</i> that the troll betray
 his master, could the party have then plotted with the troll on how to 
do it subtly and quietly, with the troll cooperating under the influence
 of the <i>suggestion</i>, maybe allowing them to ambush the boss? In 
the movies, mind-controlled people make great spies and saboteurs, 
because no one knows anything is amiss until it is too late. You give 
them orders, commands, or suggestions and they carry them out. I keep 
thinking of old vampire movies where the victim has been dominated by 
the vampire and acts mostly normal -- maybe a little distracted -- but 
then the vampire shows up and starts directing the show.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">There are a lot of reasons to like <i>charm</i> and <i>dominate</i>
 spells. They can be very atmospheric and immensely useful in the right 
situation. Players might even have fun "going rogue" on the rest of 
their party if you let them play out the results of having their 
characters get <i>charmed</i> or <i>dominated</i> by the bad guys (which
 also saves you the trouble of directing their actions in addition to 
those of the opponents). You just have exercise care in using them to 
make sure these effects are not infinitely powerful or totally 
worthless. Either way is no fun, but a sensible approach, and sometimes 
erring on the side of being generous in how effective they are, makes 
them a useful part of the game and comparable in value to the rest of 
the "old reliables" in the spellslinger's arsenal.</span></p>
