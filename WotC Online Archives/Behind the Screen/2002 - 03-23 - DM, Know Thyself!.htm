<p class="size2">In the initial installment of Behind the Screen, we 
discussed how to build a foundation for a good campaign by ensuring that
 communication takes place among all of the players, including the DM. 
In that spirit, it is important for you as a DM to get to know the one 
person with whom you will spend the most time gaming -- <b>yourself</b>.
 There are things about the way you game and why you game that only you 
know, and there also may be some things that you never know unless you 
ask someone else to point them out to you. In any case, bringing the 
varying facets of your gaming mindset to the foreground can help you 
account for them and either accentuate them (if positive) or work around
 them (if negative).</p>
<p class="size2">In the category of things that only you know about 
yourself lays the realm of what you enjoy in running a game, and 
conversely what you dread about running a game. In thinking about 
different elements of the game, you might lean a bit on the wisdom of 
Gary Gygax, one of the co-creators of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game. He recently wrote a series of columns in <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i>
 describing survey data he had garnered on what kinds of things gamers 
-- and gamemasters in particular -- felt were important in a good game 
or that they enjoyed as a part of their game. Whether or not you fit the
 typical profile he encountered is not really important; the point is 
that these categories (see below for examples) provide a useful 
conceptual framework for ordering your thinking about the parts of the 
gaming (and DMing) experience. With some kind of classification system 
in mind, you can sort different parts of the game you run and look at 
each "bin" of sorted parts to see which parts you really enjoy. As an 
example, you might divide up a campaign based on the old <i>Against the Giants</i> adventures like this:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size2">1.<b> Hacking</b>: Kill giants, kill more giants, kill ogres and trolls, kill giants, and so on.</p>
<p class="size2">2. <b>Magical Combat:</b> Fight with ogre magi. Have combats in dragon lairs and evil drow temples.</p>
<p class="size2">3. <b>Mystery:</b> Why the alliance between different 
giant races? What's with the weird abandoned temples and strange altars?
 What are those secret messages in elven script? What are they <i>really</i> trying to do?</p>
<p class="size2">4. <b>Exotic Locations:</b> We go to the deep forest 
and a large-scale fortress, a frozen mountain glacier and caves, a 
volcanic slag-heap, and the Underdark. How do we get the party from one 
place to another? Magic? Overland journey? What might happen along the 
way?</p>
<p class="size2">5. <b>Full-Scale War:</b> Do we play out the giant 
invasion? Are these giants all that are involved, or are these just 
their main bases of operation? Does the war continue while the PCs are 
attacking the giant bases? What is the giant response to the attacks of 
the PCs? More war?</p>
<p class="size2">6. <b>Sociopolitical:</b> How and why do the PCs get 
entangled in the whole giant affair? Are they asked by a friendly noble?
 Commanded by a royal edict? Simply swept up in the middle of the 
invasion? Have the giants attacked the PCs' homeland? A friendly nation 
nearby? What do other nations (or races) think about it?</p>
<p class="size2">7. <b>Puzzles:</b> How well-hidden should things be? 
Have PCs earned their loot by bashing the monsters, or do they have to 
find it too? How cunning should the giants really be, even with outside 
help? Should they place traps and ambushes? Should apparent treasures 
and combats be decoys?</p>
<p class="size2">8. <b>Allies:</b> Should the PCs expect help from NPCs 
or creatures they might meet? Are there captives to be rescued, and can 
they be of any assistance in the war effort?</p>
<p class="size2">9. <b>Interaction:</b> How much occasion for 
conversation will PCs have with the creatures they encounter? Will you 
even need names for the bad guys, or are they simply sword fodder? Are 
all of the bad guys equally bad? How do they interact with each other?</p>
<p class="size2">10. <b>Timing:</b> How important is the passage of 
time? Can the PCs raid the giant lairs' at their leisure? Will there be 
opportunities to rest, resupply, seek guidance or training from others, 
or do anything else during the adventure? What else will be happening in
 the world while the PCs undertake the adventure?</p>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">In thinking about questions like these, you can sort 
out the kinds of questions you really want to deal with and which ones 
you would prefer to skip entirely. If you enjoy exploring the impact of 
adventure scenarios on the world around the PCs, you might put a heavy 
emphasis on the <b>sociopolitical</b> dimension, and you may or may not want to actually play out the course of the <b>war</b>
 "on-stage," so to speak. You can decide how far along the war has come 
and then briefly narrate the events for their benefit. This can provide 
context for the sociopolitical setting. In the course of dealing with 
the local authorities and whatever their own investigations may reveal, 
the PCs may get a dawning sense of the <b>mystery</b> element, at least a basic notion of what <b>allies</b> they have, and presumably some sense of the <b>exotic locales</b>
 involved. Then they can pursue the adventure to its fruition: 
infiltrating the giant lairs and undoing their alliance from within (by a
 campaign of extermination if necessary). Of course, you may decide to 
waive the entire background and have the PCs come upon one of the giant 
lairs while traveling through the wilderness, with little or no idea of 
what the giants may be up to. The giants may be hostile, or they may 
think the PCs are in league with their "advisors," which could lead to a
 bounty of <b>interaction</b> or a bacchanalia of <b>hacking</b>, 
depending on how it goes. In other words, you can take a given scenario 
(or even an entire gaming environment, like a nation, world, or plane of
 existence) and divide it up any number of ways; two different gaming 
groups might play the same printed adventure but have wildly different 
experiences because of the parts that you, as DM, saw fit to emphasize. 
There is nothing at all wrong with that. In fact, it can help your 
enjoyment (and quite probably that of your players at the same time) if 
you can look at an adventure idea, whether it is your own creation, 
something bought off the rack, or an amalgam of the two, and decide 
which parts appeal to you and which do not.</p>
<p class="size2">Taking all of this into account, however, you should 
not let your enthusiasm (or lack thereof) be the sole determining factor
 in what you run and how you run it. You may very well enjoy some 
aspects of the game but lack the skill to carry them off, and that can 
put a crimp in the enjoyment of the other participants. This is where 
good communication is essential, because only by talking to your players
 can you complete your internal checklist of your strengths and 
weaknesses as a DM. No matter how much you love the idea of <b>magical combat</b>,
 if it turns the game into a quagmire of rules referencing, you might 
want to consider de-emphasizing that element until you have boned up on 
tactical applications of the rules. Likewise, the <b>sociopolitical</b> elements or dealing with <b>allies</b>
 that you enjoy may be crushingly dull for players if overdone in 
quantity (no matter how good it might be, there is only so much room in a
 gamer's mind for imaginary history and politics) or poorly handled in 
quality (most of the supposed allies turn out to be backstabbing 
doppelgangers or wererats, for example). Maybe everything is mostly 
fine, but the campaign just doesn't feel right because nothing ever 
happens unless the party is there, and time seems to be perpetually 
frozen on May 2nd on a partly sunny day.</p>
<p class="size2">It is important to remember that players can also point
 out what they think you do very well but where perhaps you sell 
yourself short. Maybe your descriptions of <b>exotic locales</b> and 
overland journeys are evocative and compelling, really making the 
players feel the experience, but you spend most of your time stuffing 
them into endless 10-foot-wide dungeon corridors. Maybe you are capable 
of fiendishly clever <b>puzzles</b> or engaging <b>mysteries</b>, but 
drop them in occasionally as one-offs instead of weaving them into the 
full tapestry of the campaign. Whatever your strengths and weaknesses 
may be, you may be the last person in the world to be aware of them, so 
use your players as a sounding board to see what you are doing well and 
where you need work. Combining input from others on what you do well 
with your own knowledge of what you enjoy, you can work to maximize your
 strong suits and make sure those parts of your game remain not just 
good but <i>memorable</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">At the same time, if you discover that things you don't
 do very well also happen to be things you don't enjoy, one simple 
solution is to ditch (or at least minimize) those elements entirely from
 your game. If your players don't particularly enjoy these elements, 
this is probably the best solution. On the other hand, you might 
consider the idea that you (and perhaps your players) have not enjoyed 
these elements <i>because</i> you have never done them well. In that 
case, you could try to work out a new way of approaching that part of 
the game by talking to other DMs (possibly including some of your 
players) about how they handle those elements of the game. Playing a 
character in someone else's campaign is an excellent way to get a view 
from "the other side" and see how DMs handle different game elements. 
You may pick up some ideas that give you the impetus to try again with a
 fresh approach. When you solicit comments and suggestions from your 
players and other gamers, and when you view them as formative tools 
(rather than as some sort of criticism or challenge), you can greatly 
improve the quality of your campaign.</p>
