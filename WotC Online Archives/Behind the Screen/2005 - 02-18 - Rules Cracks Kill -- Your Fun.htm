<p align="center"><b>WORDS TO THE WISE</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>It's all about da wizard:</i> The concept of creating
 new sorcerer/wizard magic fits so well with the conventions of the 
fantasy genre, but their magic is easy to restrict and control because 
the rules already provide for limited knowledge out of all possible 
arcane spells.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Just say no to crack:</i> Be wary of spells that add 
new damage types or otherwise stray outside of how the system is 
designed. You should keep in mind that you want to avoid creating new 
rule problems around these cracks and loopholes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Double or nothing:</i> Check to see if a new type of spell or device duplicates some already-existing category. Avoid redundancy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Take what you are given:</i> Sorcerer/wizard spells are the most common kind of new magical idea in published game supplements and in <b>D&amp;D</b>-based
 websites and newsgroups, and new magic items probably run a close 
second. USE THEM! Tweak, adjust, but make use of the plentiful resources
 available; you can almost always find a good supply of things to fit 
any theme, either as is or with a little massaging.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>We are not alone in the universe:</i> DMing may seem 
like a lonely job, but reach out and draw on the knowledge and 
experience of others. Use all your gifts and talents -- as much as your 
time and inclination allow -- but remember that all of us together are 
greater than any of us alone. Use the gifts and talents of others to 
enrich your game and enliven all that you do behind the screen.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Samantha has always liked playing arcane spellcasters, 
in part because she liked the creative side of things. To her, divine 
magic seemed kind of immutable -- you got what your god gave, and that 
was the end of it. Researching new cleric spells seemed literally 
sacrilegious. For arcane casters, though, it was almost a foregone 
conclusion that part of your career would be taken up in researching new
 spells, devising new magic trinkets, and uncovering lost lore.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ally is reminding Samantha of her now-infamous creative 
effort when the group used to play with a different DM named Jim. She 
had this great idea for a new spell called <i>alkaline spray</i>. It worked just like <i>cone of cold</i>
 but inflicted its damage through the dissolving effects of super-strong
 alkaline fluid. The beauty of the spell, of course, was that nothing in
 the game was immune to alkali damage, right? Sure, some creatures were 
immune to "acid," but alkali isn't acid. It's at the opposite end of the
 pH scale, so immunity to acid wouldn't do anything for them. She would 
be laying waste to demons and devils left and right. It was foolproof!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Well, that rationale works fine in high-school 
chemistry, but it created real game-mechanical problems for Jim. It 
essentially created a whole new category of effect, and one that was not
 taken into account in the game's design. <i>Of course</i> no one had 
resistance or immunity to it as written. It was a nonissue in the game 
design, and Samantha was trying to exploit an apparent loophole in the 
rules. It would be like creating a spell that inflicted "radiation" 
damage or "flesh-eating bacteria" damage (or "gas" damage like the <b>AD&amp;D</b>
 green and gold dragons). It's adding something outside of the scope of 
the rules. If you are not willing to retrofit the rules to incorporate 
the new added feature, then you're going to end up with an unbalanced 
mess. The campaign eventually ended and the characters were retired, but
 Eddie certainly took note from playing alongside Samantha and resolved 
that he wasn't going to let anything like that slide through on his 
watch.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Still, it's an interesting conundrum when you're the DM 
creating arcane magical stuff -- spells or items -- to go with your new 
theme. In some ways, the perfect thing would seem to be to create a 
whole new category of effect that this new culture uses, or an entirely 
new type of item. The obvious problem is that this leads to balancing 
problems like those above, much like what happens in campaigns where 
psionics are introduced as an appendix or add-on, like 1st and 2nd 
edition <b>AD&amp;D,</b> or even with using the "Psionics Are Different" rules variant in the <i>Psionics Handbook</i> or <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>.
 It definitely makes things more interesting, but there will be 
headaches aplenty. From much first-hand experience, Eddie came to the 
only conclusion he could: That way lies madness!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Creating a new category of magic items is also gilding 
the lily. There is really no type of magic item that can't be fit 
comfortably into the item types already extant. Making new item creation
 feats and new item types are going to end up just being a subset of 
something already existing (perhaps a single-use talisman that could as 
well be a wondrous item or potion, or a special kind of weapon that 
could as easily fall under arms and armor) or something that differs 
only in flavor text from an extant item (for example, "runesticks" that 
store spells identically to scrolls except for the medium on which the 
spells are stored). This bloats the feat lists and needlessly 
complicates item creation, identification, and use. Keep it simple!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eddie's siv design made this process easy, since arcane 
magic was deemphasized anyway. Still, so many arcane spells were out 
there that it wasn't really hard to tailor spell lists without making up
 any special rationalizations. Divine magic allows you to get whatever 
the deities are dishing out, but arcane magic is both more open and more
 restricted at the same time. It is freer because you potentially can 
learn anything if you have the information at hand. It is more 
restricted because whatever you know, that is what you know. Period. 
Sorcerers and bards have the spells due to their magical natures. 
Wizards have what's in their spellbooks. They don't have the range of 
the full sorcerer/wizard list each time they need to prepare spells. If 
PCs find some of the sivs' arcane knowledge and makes use of it, good 
for them! It's an expected part of <b>D&amp;D</b> -- the looting of the enemy and the seizing of their resources.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The mechanics for how PCs find and use the arcane magic 
of their enemies are simple and straightforward. For the sivs and their 
arcane allies, simply assign them the spells you want them to have. You 
know which spells are known commonly in the society you have devised. 
Also, some spells may be known by none of the sivs due to lack of 
exposure. You don't have to make up any complicated rules or 
rationalization as to why the siv arcane casters always use certain 
types of spells (or specific favorites) as you might with divine magic.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Arcane magic is also the easiest to beg, borrow, or 
steal from other places. For good or ill, the prejudice toward creating 
new sorcerer and wizard spells rather than new spells of other types is 
just as true in game design and publishing as it is in day-to-day 
gameplay. There are hundreds -- maybe thousands -- of new spells out 
there just waiting to get used. Every rulebook has a batch of new ones, 
and more come every month in <i>Dragon</i><i>Magazine</i> and similar 
publications, to say nothing of fan-made websites, newsgroups, and the 
like -- you can even import ideas from other game systems or older 
versions of <b>D&amp;D</b>. If you've got an idea or three you want to 
try out, go for it. The suggestions for working with divine magic and 
scaling it relative to existing effects apply equally well here. But if 
you don't, nearly infinite numbers of new magic items and spells are 
being released every month. Browse at your leisure and pluck the 
tastiest-looking ones that fit the theme you're creating.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Your creativity can show in the ways you mix and match 
and incorporate or tweak the creations of others, just as well as it 
shows for things you make up from whole cloth. For that matter, feel 
free to share your creations with others out there when you do make up 
something new, so that others can mix and match or use as they wish. You
 may even have the amusing experience somewhere down the road (as I did 
once) of playing in a game where a DM has pulled something you made once
 upon a time and worked it into his campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That is perhaps the first and best rule to learn, not 
just for arcane magic, but for anything you do behind the screen: You 
may sit back there alone, but you're not alone in your work. You have 
the chance to do it yourself, but that doesn't mean you have to do <i>everything</i>
 yourself. Taking a published adventure and tailoring it to your tastes,
 culling together spells, magic items, NPCs, and so on, from other 
sources and weaving them together in a way that is all your own -- that 
is every bit as much the mark of a good DM as creating every last detail
 out of nothing. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If you don't want or need to look at anyone else's 
ideas, whether because you have lots of time, confidence in your 
creative abilities, or just flat-out talent, then play any way you like!
 Just remember that even the brightest, most creative, and most talented
 DM to ever sit behind the screen may get more bang for her buck from 
drawing upon the ideas of other bright, creative, and talented people 
and weaving them together with their own. No one person can ever be as 
smart, creative, and talented as all of us put together, so tap into the
 resources all around you: professional game designers, fellow DMs, your
 players, or sometimes even nongamer friends who might just lend a 
critical eye to plot or detail.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eddie has his great idea for a lost-city-in-the-jungle 
campaign, which he is just about ready to start running, but so much of 
his work was seeing what already existed in the system, plugging and 
cross-wiring things together, and seeing what he could make and how that
 would fit with his concept. He had to be careful about creating things 
that didn't fit with the game system because he didn't want to create 
rules problems that would poke into (or create) cracks or loopholes in 
the system or create needless and redundant duplication of things 
already handled well enough in the rules. When you've done your research
 into what the game system already offers, and after you have done the 
work of figuring out how that fits with what you want to create and what
 you want to add, subtract, or otherwise adjust, you will be ready to 
rock your players' world!</p>
