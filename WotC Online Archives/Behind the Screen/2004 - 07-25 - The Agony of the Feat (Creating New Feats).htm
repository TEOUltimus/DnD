<p align="LEFT">Welcome back to our Behind the Screen workshop on building campaign story arcs. <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/bs/20040620a">Last time</a>,
 we started examining the process of setting up a framework for your 
campaign's typical NPCs, exemplified by the "character region" Eddie 
drew up for the frog-folk sivs that he has made the centerpiece of his 
story arc. Now we'll finish off that discussion with <b>feats</b>, which are complicated enough to deserve their own column.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Feats are a nifty way of working in special abilities 
for characters in a manner that keeps the game in balance -- maybe too 
nifty. If every supplement adds a dozen new feats, pretty soon you end 
up with hundreds of feats spread across a bunch of books, and you're 
right where 2nd Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b> was with nonweapon 
proficiencies. It's a catch-22: You want neat new content, but every 
sheaf of new goodies just further bloats the list. Further, unless you 
let players retrofit their characters each time a new reference comes 
up, most of those new feats will never -- <i>can</i> never -- get used, 
because their PCs are already set up for the prerequisites and feats 
that fit with established character concepts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Remember, however, that everything in the campaign need 
not be for player use. As DM, you're the one with the flexibility to mix
 and match NPCs and monsters with all the weird feats you like. As with 
other aspects of the game, take care to balance material that is 
probably only for the DM's use. If some feats are clearly light years 
better than others but only the bad guys get to use them, then you have a
 problem. Sure, everybody has favorites, and different feats fit better 
for different character types, but some feats<i> are</i> just better 
than others (Improved Trip anyone?). That kind of thing should be the 
exception, not the rule, and extra-good feats should be limited in some 
way. Look at existing feats and what they let you do, and try to keep 
new or modified feat ideas in line with that (at least in the ballpark).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eddie has already looked around for feats that would be fit the siv culture. Regions are big in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 setting, and some of those feats fit quite well. Sivs are highly 
organized and structured, so Discipline seems a natural fit. Since Eddie
 has moved his sivs into a jungle setting (though still marshy), the 
Forester and Treetopper feats actually make a great deal of sense for 
those sivs who skulk and hunt in the jungles around their home. Resist 
Poison also makes sense in a jungle setting rife with venomous vermin 
and animals. Another interesting possibility is Foe Hunter, which could 
grant "favored enemy" benefits against dinosaurs, lizardfolk, dire 
animals, or perhaps some jungle humanoid such as goblins or halflings 
(using the Jungle Races variants in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881560000">Unearthed Arcana</a>,</i> pages 13-15). <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/885780000">Races of Faerûn</a></i>
 offers the Disentangler and Jungle Stamina regional feats as appealing 
choices, as well as the more general Improved Energy Resistance, 
Improved Natural Armor, and Rapid Swimming. And Eddie needn't stick to <b>Forgotten Realms </b>feats.
 For example, because sivs use nets, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net) 
could be taken as a regional feat. Or maybe sivs could enhance their 
wide-angle frog-eyes with Eyes in the Back of Your Head or unleash a 
Kiai Shout (Croak!) from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/176640000">Complete Warrior</a></i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT">However, many of these feats have prerequisites (aside 
from race/region), and this is where Eddie wanted Samantha's advice. Can
 you have more than one regional feat?<b></b>Are they something you take at 1st level or can you take them later?<b></b>You could use the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000">Eberron</a></b>
 model where regional feats are just suggestions of typical feats for 
your culture. You can take as many as you like (and qualify for), but 
only from your area. The World of <b>Greyhawk</b> (see articles in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizopublishing.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_bs_20040725a">Dragon</a></i>
 #315 and #319) is similar, but there you can qualify for feats from 
regions other than your own by taking ranks in Knowledge (local), and 
some feats must be taken at 1st level or not at all. The v.3.0 <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000">Forgotten Realms</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000"> Campaign Setting</a></i> and its companion books (e.g., <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/176650000">Unapproachable East</a></i>)
 used this idea also, with the extra feature that characters of a 
"preferred class" could even get a bonus regional feat at 1st level. The
 v.3.5 <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/886470000">Player's Guide to Faerûn</a></i>
 is much more restrictive: You get only one regional feat (which is 
generally much better than other feats), and you must take it at 1st 
level.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are enough cool feats out there that Eddie is 
leaning toward a mix of ideas, starting with letting sivs take more than
 one regional feat (maybe Samantha's power-gaming influence showing 
through!). Some make sense as feats that are typical for siv culture, 
like the <b>Eberron</b> model. At the same time, taking a single 
powerful regional feat at 1st level appeals to him, too. In fact, it's a
 way to make distinctions <i>within</i> siv culture: Each siv <i>must</i>
 take a regional feat at 1st level, with each different feat-group 
belonging to a different caste (or perhaps bearing particular color 
markings), while all sivs can possess the recommended (general) feats.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You will probably find a number of existing feats that 
could suit your purposes, but you can also adapt existing feats, 
tweaking them a little to fit better. That could mean taking the basic 
structure of a feat but altering it slightly; Eddie, for instance, might
 switch the Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot bonuses from the 
Forester feat to work in swamp/marsh terrain instead. Likewise, it makes
 sense that a frog-race could have some sort of "Hopping Charge" feat, 
as they leap to the attack. This could be identical to the Battle Jump 
feat in <i>Unapproachable East</i> or maybe Powerful Charge from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/965820000">Miniatures Handbook</a></i>. Remember your theme and stick with it -- play it up.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you don't find any existing options that are just 
right, you can always make stuff up! Eddie would like a feat that 
enhances the siv water-walking power. The ability is nice for show, but 
actually very difficult to use in combat: Ability checks are no sure 
thing! One way to improve it is to change from a straight Dexterity 
check to a Dexterity-based skill check. That way, a siv can boost its 
chances of success by spending skill points or using a skill-based magic
 item. Water walking is not that powerful, so maybe the feat should just
 make the ability automatically successful. You could go both ways on 
this, but given how it is likely to be used, it could put sivs at a 
large advantage vs. PCs, so Eddie decides to stick with just improving 
the check, throwing in minor skill bonuses as well. If the feat gave 
auto-success, he'd probably drop those bonuses.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Another feat might emphasize the sivs' slippery 
frog-skin and how hard they are to catch. Like the water-walking feat, 
you could make this auto-successful, like how kuo-toa automatically slip
 out of webs and nets and such. That feels like too much for a feat, 
though; maybe he could just make Escape Artist better, easier, or just <i>faster</i>
 to use. He could add a skill bonus, but for variety he could instead 
make Escape Artist always a class skill, so it's easy to put points 
into. Remember the theme, though, because that might put limitations on 
the feat. Slippery skin, for example, means your <i>skin</i> has to be exposed, right? An armor restriction seems very appropriate for this feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Speaking of skin, Eddie is fascinated by those tiny 
poisonous jungle frogs and would like to create a feat inspired by them.
 Can a feat give you a whole new special attack? Kiai Shout sort of 
does, or Stunning Attack, but they are limited in use. A poison skin 
would make more sense if it's always "on." Can you use the toxic skin 
offensively? Is it more effective when someone grapples you than if they
 just touch you? What if you're wearing armor or clothing? As DM, Eddie 
could just add it to the sivs as an innate racial ability, but how much 
does he want to change the basic creature?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Part of using feats is to help you as a DM think about 
how to build creatures within the rules, rather than just completely ad 
hoc. Something that adds an entirely new ability to a creature might go 
beyond the intended purpose of feats. Next time we'll look at creating 
creature templates -- probably a better route to go for more significant
 changes like this "toxic skin" concept.</p>
