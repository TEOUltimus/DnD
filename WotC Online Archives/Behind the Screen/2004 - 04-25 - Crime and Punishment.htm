</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes adventuring situations are not simple. 
Character actions can have legal consequences, even if the PCs have a 
reasonable excuse for their actions. In this case, they didn't know 
Teman Kohath was working on an investigation for his brother, the 
Imperial Inquisitor. They figured he was just another petty thief. Maybe
 they should have known (and ignored some clues Eddie had dropped), but 
it's not reasonable to expect the PCs to know (or care) about the 
motivations of every NPC in the world, and to a degree they have to take
 NPCs at face value or they'd spend more time doing background checks 
than adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Still, they messed up the investigation and could get in
 trouble for it. Say they return to Elath to try to make amends, only to
 find that Teman (whom they left tied up and unconscious in their rooms)
 has been sold into slavery. Troubles can pile on top of troubles, and 
this is all still an accidental incident. Things could get much hairier 
if the PCs can be proven to have done in someone on purpose. Messing 
with a well-connected villain could land the PCs, rather than the <i>real</i> bad guy, in trouble with the law.</p>
<p align="LEFT">PCs can cross the line with wealth as well. Say they 
come into town to sell the loot from their latest haul, only to be 
confronted by someone else who has a legal claim to their stuff. Salvage
 taxes are one form of this, but maybe the whole pile will be claimed by
 an heir to the family that once lived in the ruins of Greenstone Keep, 
which Mikko and his buddies have just looted. Do they have to give it 
up? Do they have "salvage rights" to what they found? What if they are 
accused of selling counterfeit or stolen goods? What if the PCs didn't 
know the origins of their items and sold them in good faith -- can they 
still get in trouble? </p>
<p align="LEFT">In a game with mind-reading and lie-detecting you'd 
think getting to the bottom of a legal dispute would be easy. Just cast 
the right spell and everybody knows what really happened, right? Well, 
the judge in Elath isn't likely to take Melantha's word for it that she 
just cast <i>discern lies</i>, so even if PCs can cast these spells it 
may not do them much good. Also, unless you are in a major city or a 
magically oriented culture, casters able and willing to do these spells 
for the legal system are not going to be stacked up like cordwood. There
 is also, of course, the chance that someone with legal connections can 
get someone to do a bogus divination to incriminate the party.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What happens if the party does get in trouble with the 
law? Do you really send them to jail? You could. The episode might 
become a sort of enforced down-time as the PCs sit there and take their 
punishment, however fair or unfair it might be. Or they could try to 
bust out. You could roleplay some of their prison experience (there may 
be useful contacts to be made "on the inside"), or hand-wave it away as a
 certain amount of time passing before their release.</p>
<p align="LEFT">More commonly, PCs are required to make restitution. 
This may be a payoff of some kind to the person they have harmed (or are
 believed to have harmed), in money or items. They may have to pay fines
 and fees to the government. Perhaps most commonly, they may be required
 to perform some service to make things right, like the Fair Warning 
gang being sent back to Elath to find and rescue Teman Kohath.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eddie is playing a dangerous game here, as Michael is 
not the only one who would cry foul at what could feel like blatant DM 
power plays, slapping a surprise "treasure tax" on them or getting Mikko
 and friends into legal trouble for something they couldn't reasonably 
have known. Life isn't fair, but players need to know the basic ground 
rules so it's not actively <i>un</i>fair.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At heart, adventurers are vigilantes, making 
life-and-death decisions and confiscating property, but what separates 
them from brigands besides (usually) alignment? PCs are at home in wild 
borderland areas, where your legal rights are as strong as your 
sword-arm. They are beholden to no one but themselves. What's theirs is 
theirs unless someone stronger or sneakier takes it from them. It's 
finders keepers, losers weepers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In civilized lands, adventurers are not a law unto 
themselves, so what are the rules for adventurers? Local customs will 
vary. Special legal rights may attach to being a citizen of a certain 
land, while outsiders are at a disadvantage. How will Mikko react when 
he learns that dwarves are banned from all bars and taverns in the Duchy
 of Zolmanna? Knowledge (local) is the ideal skill for this, but Gather 
Information or bardic knowledge could substitute as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">More generally, what are adventurers considered to be? 
Are they total free agents, working outside the law, looking for 
adventure in whatever comes their way? If so, are they feared and hated 
as killers, scavengers, grave-robbers, and thrill-seekers, or are they 
seen as a helpful (if potentially dangerous) way to deal with threats 
beyond the capabilities of regular folks?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adventurers can gain legitimacy by accepting commissions
 from the wealthy and influential, or taking up religious or political 
causes, or working with rather than outside the legal authorities. This 
makes PCs more like private investigators or mercenaries -- often with a
 patron who can get them out of trouble should they break a few laws 
along the way -- or even deputized in the service of the legal 
authorities. This is more restrictive than heading to the Adventurer's 
Guild and seeing what rumors are posted on the board (or using Gather 
Information to get the word on the street), but it can help avoid legal 
complications later.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One idea Eddie borrowed from the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 is that of registered adventuring companies. This practice gives a 
group some legitimacy and legal standing that can be recognized from 
place to place, though each new land they enter may require a fee and 
periodic renewals to validate their registration. This is more than just
 a cash grab by governments. It is a way to keep track of potential 
rogue elements in the realm. For the PCs, it is a way to give themselves
 a public face and help build a reputation, which can attract more and 
better opportunities. You could make adventuring groups document their 
adventures (and taxes paid) in an annual report to the government to get
 recertified, though this could get silly; this is <b>D&amp;D</b>, not 
accounting class. Still, an adventuring compact could prevent the legal 
shakedowns that Michael hates. Some groups might even hire an agent to 
handle the PCs' affairs (and money) when they are adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Civilization has its own set of dangers, which can be 
more frustrating than those in the wilderness because they are a little 
too much like those we face in our own everyday lives. <b>D&amp;D </b>is
 escapist fantasy, and in balancing escapism with "realism" don't go 
overboard or be punitive about the legal challenges you place in the 
PCs' path. It's fine if the players get frustrated now and then, 
reminding them that there are other people in the campaign who have 
their own agendas. Just don't make it so much hassle to go adventuring 
that they'd rather stay home and play <i>Farmer: The Roleplaying Game</i>!</p>
