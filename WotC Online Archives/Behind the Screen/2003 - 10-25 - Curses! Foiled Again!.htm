heard salt is a good preservative. I'll undo the spell once we figure

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>"Cursed? This sword is great!" Michael said. "This is the most damage I've ever done in my career!"</i></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:15px;"><i><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Should you place cursed items?</span></i><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
 Only if you want to deal with them -- and their consequences -- in the 
campaign. Be aware that getting rid of a cursed item often jumps to the 
top of the party's priority list, so it may derail other activity in the
 campaign. Don't overdo it, but one now and then can keep players from 
getting too comfortable.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Do you need curses?</i>
 No, not really. You can just use spells and not call them curses, but 
it does add a dash of panache if a curse is something special.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Is one curse spell enough?</i>
 Allow players to invent individual curses, or develop special types for
 different religions or cultures. Even add other curse spells if you 
want them stronger or with special effects (e.g., generational curses, 
multiple-use curses, dying curses).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Seek inspiration from a broad range of sources.</i> The feel of the curse is more important than its effects, so find ideas wherever you can, including older versions of <b>D&amp;D</b> or other games. The <b>Ravenloft </b>setting<b></b>is a good place to start.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Make the cure fit the curse.</i>
 Make sure a cure is possible and within the ability of the characters 
to achieve (though it may be hard). Put as much flavor in the cure as 
you do in the curse.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A cursed sword. As Michael points out, cursed items aren't necessarily all bad: His sword is still a <i>keen shortsword</i>. It just has this little drawback. Well, maybe it's not a <i>little</i> drawback, from Ally's side of the table! Cursed items are the most common place you see curses implemented in <b>D&amp;D</b>, certainly the best explained and detailed in the rules. The <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">Dungeon Master</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">'s Guide</a></i> (pp. 272-277) </span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">has
 some handy tables and suggestions for creating and using cursed items. 
Objects and their effect range from the merely annoying to the 
potentially deadly, but they're always at least little bit complicated.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mikko's
 sword is more than just complicated, though, and could be devastating 
to the party if its curse manifests at the wrong time. Its curse is 
nasty (though useful for the DM to remind players sometimes that all 
magic ain't good magic). You don't want to overdo the effects of a 
cursed item, or your players will get so paranoid (or angry) that no one
 will be having fun.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Be
 prepared for the possibility that the party may want to destroy or get 
rid of a cursed item, and be aware that they just might try to sell it. 
They might sell it not knowing its curse, or maybe they know and want to
 make a quick buck anyway! That's pretty scummy but certainly possible, 
depending on the alignment of the PCs. You have to decide how good NPCs 
are at detecting curses, and what will they do if they find out--whether
 the players knew about the curse or not.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 any case, cursed items are covered pretty well in the rules, but curses
 on people and places are less well defined. You have to ask what a 
"curse" really is. Does it just mean a place is evil? Haunted? Unlucky? 
Enchanted in some way? In the world of Harry Potter, a curse or jinx is 
pretty much the same as any other spell, though it's usually something 
nasty -- from locking your legs together, to making you barf slugs, to 
killing with the stroke of a wand. In the real world, curses evoke 
thoughts of King Tut's tomb or Indian burial grounds, mysterious places 
where bad things happen to people who mess around where they don't 
belong. Literature and even religion bring to mind family curses, 
terrible secrets handed down from generation to generation, and sins of 
fathers (or mothers) visited down upon succeeding generations.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Okay, that's all spooky, but how does it relate to <b>D&amp;D</b>? The ability of undead to create spawn is sort of like a curse, but it has its own game mechanic in <b>D&amp;D</b>. Mummy rot is a curse, in that you have to cast <i>remove curse</i>
 before you can cure the disease, but that's about it. No canopic jars 
or tannin leaves here. Lycanthropy is a good example of a very 
specialized curse, but like mummy rot, it's described in the rules more 
as a magical disease, an affliction, with elements of a curse. How do 
"natural" lycanthropes acquire the curse or get rid of it?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even less attention is paid to the idea of curses on a place, and in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 that whole idea is probably subsumed into guardian spells of various 
kinds. Mikko didn't fear the "Curse of the Reaver" when he violated the 
warrior's tomb; he just had to find and disarm the <i>greater glyph of warding</i> with a stored <i>blade barrier</i>
 spell. Curse, schmurse -- it's just a spell! Everyone who enters the 
Dungeon of the Yellow Sign goes mad? Sure, because there are <i>symbols of insanity</i> there.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So
 we're back to a "curse" being just another spell (or monster ability or
 item) with flavor text added. If you want to curse somebody, you cast <i>bestow curse</i>. The effects are nasty enough, but pretty generic. <i>BOR-ing</i>!
 It also says that you can invent other curses of about the same power 
level. That opens up lots of possibilities, but still you have to ask 
the question: Do you need more curses? Why not just use the spells we 
already have?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Well,
 you got me. There is absolutely no reason that you have to make up any 
new curses. You could just use the spells that are already there. But it
 <i>is</i> an easy place to add some spice to your game. In <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_bs_20031025a">Dragon</a></i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">#50, the article <i>The Glyphs of Cerilon</i> offered 50-some <i>glyphs of warding.</i> You didn't just cast <i>blast glyph-fire</i>
 or whatever--you learned individual glyphs that did different things, 
and some churches (or alignments) might use some glyphs but not others. 
The same idea could be used for curses. So when Melantha busts out <i>bestow curse</i>
 she's choosing from the curses she knows. Each religion or culture 
might teach only a few curses, or most curses could be commonly known 
with a few being forbidden or illegal, like the "unforgivable" <i>cruciatus, imperius</i>, and <i>avara kedavra</i> curses of Harry Potter's world.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If some curses are stronger than a 3rd-level spell, you could add a few other curse spells to the list, like <i>ancient curse, divine curse</i>, and <i>dying curse</i> from the <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Oriental Adventures</i> book, or the Mulhorandi <i>major curse</i> and <i>bane</i> from the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>. Michael might be less sanguine about curses if Mikko's latest victim utters a <i>dying curse</i> that turns his hands into turnips! The <b>AD&amp;D Ravenloft </b>campaign and <i>Forbidden Lore</i>
 boxed set had lots of atmospheric suggestions on how and when to use 
curses (and their remedies) in the campaign. A cursed item or creature 
or location could actually be possessed by an evil spirit, and you might
 use the corruption rules from the <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Van Richten's Guide to Fiends</i> or the fiend of possession prestige class from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/886610000">Fiend Folio</a></i>, </span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">or pull out some creepiness from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881610000">Book of Vile Darkness</a></i>. </span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Other game systems certainly hold potential as sources of ideas for new curses; <i>Rolemaster's</i> old <i>Spell Law</i>
 supplement included a variety of culture-specific ones. The game 
mechanics are usually not hard to tweak, and the important thing is that
 a curse should <i>feel</i> different from just another spell or magic item.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 you're having your fun being an evil DM, don't forget about 
counter-curses: Every curse should have some sort of remedy. Arphaxad, 
Melantha, and Rashean are going to be very peeved if there is no way to 
get Mikko's cursed sword away from him. If the sword simply cannot be 
gotten rid of, then they will be forced to ditch the dwarf, and you 
can't really blame them--he can't be counted on not to betray and <i>attack</i> them. Now you've got four mad players, or maybe no players at all if they get mad enough.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That doesn't mean the cure has to be easy or cheap, but there must be <i>some</i>
 way of getting rid of a cursed item, or lifting a curse from a 
character. Allow them to research the history of the curse and figure 
out clues for how they can end it. Maybe Mikko's sword must be used to 
slay the ghost of Balak the Backstabber before the ghost and the sword's
 curse can be put to rest. The cure may involve a quest for some exotic 
device or substance, or the return of some stolen object (like the gold 
in the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> film), or just a high-level 
spell. That last one is probably the easiest option but also the least 
interesting. If you're going to bother going with a "curse" for flavor 
reasons, then go for the gusto with the cure as well. The PCs may run 
away screaming once the curse has been broken, but the players will feel
 the kind of relief and accomplishment you can't buy at the magic fix-it
 shop!</span></p>
