 this column, we present several new epic feats designed for vile 
characters, new rules on epic poisons, an epic-level progression for the
 diabolist prestige class, and a brand new epic prestige class (the 
warlord of utterdark). All of these epic-level progressions enhance the 
rules provided in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88169">Epic Level Handbook</a></i> and the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?881610000">Book of Vile Darkness</a></i>. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>New Epic Feats</b></p>
<p class="size2">For information on vile feats, you will need a copy of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?881610000">Book of Vile Darkness</a></i>. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Automatic Vile Spell [Epic, Metamagic]</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">The character's lesser spells inflict wounds tainted with foul evil.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Violate Spell, Spellcraft 27 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells, any evil alignment.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> The character can cast all 0-, 1st-, 
2nd-, and 3rd-level spells as violated spells without using higher-level
 slots (see the Violate Spell metamagic feat in the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>).</p>
<p class="size2">The character can choose not to apply this effect to 
any spell as a free action as the spell is being cast (for instance, if 
her target is resistant to evil spells).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> The character can gain this feat 
multiple times. Each time the character takes the feat, the spells of 
the character's next three lowest spell levels can be violated with no 
adjustment to their spell slots. Thus, a wizard who took this feat twice
 could cast her 0- through 6th-level spells as violated spells with no 
adjustment to their spell slots.</p>
<p class="size2">This feat doesn't increase the casting time for those 
spells that normally become full-round actions when cast in metamagic 
form (including bard spells, sorcerer spells, and spontaneously cast 
spells, such as an evil cleric's <i>inflict</i> spells).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Epic Evil Brand [Epic, Vile]</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"> The character is physically marked forever as a mighty servant of evil. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Cha 19, Epic Reputation, Evil Brand.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Evil creatures automatically recognize 
the symbol now emblazoned on the character as a sign of her incredible 
dark power and reputation for evil. She gains a +6 circumstance bonus on
 Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made against evil creatures (this 
stacks with the bonus from the Evil Brand feat). </p>
<p class="size2">Furthermore, all evil creatures within 30 feet of her gain a +2 profane bonus to saves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Epic Poison Crafter [Epic]</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">The character knows secrets of poison crafting best left forgotten by mortals.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Alchemy 30 ranks or Craft (poisonmaking) 30 ranks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> The character can craft the epic poisons described below.</p>
<p class="size2">In addition, the character gains a +10 bonus to skill checks made to craft poisons. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, a character cannot craft the epic poisons described in this article.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> This feat should be added to the epic bonus feat list of the assassin class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Vile Deathstrike [Epic, Vile]</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">Creatures slain by the character's attack can be raised only on holy ground.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Evil alignment, Vile Martial Strike (or Vile Ki Strike or Vile Natural Attack).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Any creature that dies as a result of 
the character's weapon or natural weapon attack can be raised or 
otherwise returned to life by magic cast only within the area of a <i>consecrate</i> or <i>hallow</i> spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Vile Smite [Epic, Vile]</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">Your smite attack channels especially potent evil power.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Cha 25, evil alignment, smite 
ability (from class feature or domain granted power), Power Attack, 
Unholy Strike, Vile Martial Strike (or Vile Ki Strike or Vile Natural 
Attack).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> All extra damage inflicted by your smite attack is considered vile damage (see the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Epic Poisons</b></p>
<p class="size2">While most high-level characters largely ignore the 
threat of deadly toxins, some particularly devious villains have devised
 variant poisons that bypass common defenses. These poisons, often 
referred to as antimagic poisons, are effectively an <i>antimagic field</i>
 in toxic liquid (or gel) form. As such, they are totally unaffected by 
any magical effects that might protect against their effects, including 
spells such as <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i>, supernatural resistances or immunities to poison, or even magical bonuses on saves against poison (such as from a <i>cloak of resistance </i>or <i>periapt of proof against poison</i>). Even nonpermanent enhancements to the victim's ability scores do not apply to saves to resist antimagic poisons. </p>
<p class="size2">Furthermore, magical means are useless in restoring ability damage inflicted by these toxins. Only rest can restore such losses.</p>
<p class="size2">Heal checks made to tend wounds poisoned by such toxins work normally, and antitoxin's alchemical bonus to saves still applies. </p>
<p class="size2">Perhaps thankfully, only a few such toxins exist, and 
the secret of their making -- indeed, of their very existence -- is not 
widely known. Only those who have selected the Epic Poison Crafter feat 
(see above) can attempt to create such poisons. Characters without this 
feat cannot even assist in the creation of epic poisons. Below is a list
 of these poisons.</p>
<p class="size2">Much like epic magic items, crafting epic poisons uses 
slightly altered rules from crafting standard poisons. First, the 
character must spend one-third of the market price in raw materials. If 
the Craft (poisonmaking) or Alchemy check is successful, multiply the 
check result by the DC for the check. That result indicates how many 
tens of gold pieces' worth of poison are created that week. For example,
 an assassin crafting lyzeum begins by spending 110,000 gp in raw 
materials. On his first Craft (poisonmaking) skill check, he rolls a 71.
 Multiplying this result by the DC of 59 results in a total of 4,189, 
which means that he has created 41,890 gp worth of poison -- roughly 1/8
 of a dose. Assuming similar success, the task will be complete in 
another seven weeks or so.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Epic Diabolist</b></p>
<p class="size2">The epic diabolist seeks to build her power base and 
prepare for that inevitable day when she takes her rightful place as one
 of the rulers of hell itself. Though she may bargain with archdevils, 
she does so from a position of equality.</p>
<p class="size2">The epic diabolist should look to feats that strengthen
 her greatest power: her spellcasting ability. Epic Spell Focus and Epic
 Spell Penetration are excellent choices, as are Improved Spell Capacity
 and Improved Metamagic. Epic Evil Brand displays her allegiance (and 
power) for all to see. And, of course, vile feats are always attractive.</p>
<p class="size2">The epic diabolist's ability increases usually go 
toward the ability that controls her spellcasting (Intelligence, Wisdom,
 or Charisma). If she enjoys casting corrupt spells, she should also 
consider boosting any ability commonly drawn upon by such spells.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Other Options:</b> Epic diabolists with divine 
spellcasting abilities can pick up Improved Alignment-Based Casting. 
Those looking to build an army should try Epic Leadership and Legendary 
Commander.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Die:</b> d4.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</b> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> The epic diabolist's caster level 
increases by 1 per level gained above 10th. In addition, at every level,
 the epic diabolist gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a
 level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added 
the prestige class, up to the number of spells per day possessed by a 
20th-level character of that class.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Diabolism:</b> At 13th level, and every 3 levels 
thereafter, the diabolist can choose to grant one of her spells greater 
magical power one additional time per day.</p>
<p class="size2">At 15th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the 
unholy damage dealt by one of these spells increases by +1d6 (+4d6 at 
15th, +5d6 at 20th, and so forth).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bonus Feats:</b> The epic diabolist gains a bonus feat (selected from the list of epic diabolist feats) every 4 levels after 10th.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Epic Diabolist Bonus Feat List:</i> Automatic 
Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Automatic 
Violate Spell (new feat; see above), Enhance Spell, Epic Evil Brand (new
 feat; see above), Epic Reputation, Epic Spell Focus, Epic Spell 
Penetration, Epic Spellcasting, Familiar Spell, Ignore Material 
Components, Improved Alignment-Based Casting, Improved Combat Casting, 
Improved Heighten Spell, Improved Metamagic, Improved Spell Capacity, 
Intensify Spell, Multispell, Permanent Emanation, Spell Knowledge, Spell
 Opportunity, Spell Stowaway, Spontaneous Spell, Tenacious Magic. In 
addition, the epic diabolist can select any vile feat (see the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>) as a bonus feat.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Warlord of Utterdark</b></p>
<p class="size2">The warlord of utterdark is the personification of 
evil. He may be cold and calculating or savage and brutal, but one fact 
remains crystal clear: He is evil incarnate and the sworn foe of all who
 hold good and mercy dear to their hearts. </p>
<p class="size2">The path of utterdark attracts fighters, barbarians, 
rangers, monks, and even fallen paladins. However, most warlords of 
utterdark come from the ranks of blackguards or warriors of darkness 
(see the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>).</p>
<p class="size2">A warlord of utterdark can rule an army of like-minded 
individuals, or he may serve an even more powerful master of evil, 
whether mortal or divine. They care nothing for rank or personal honor 
-- only the performance of vile deeds upon innocents interests them. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Die:</b> d10.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Requirements</b></p>
<p class="size2">To qualify to become a warlord of utterdark, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Alignment:</b> Any evil.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +21.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills:</b> Alchemy 12 ranks, Hide 15 ranks, 
Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 9 ranks, Speak Language
 (Abyssal and Infernal), Spellcraft 6 ranks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Feats:</b> Cleave, Evil Brand, Great Cleave, Iron 
Will, Power Attack, Sunder, Vile Martial Strike (or Vile Ki Strike or 
Vile Natural Attack).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> The character must endure a month-long 
ritual of black magic performed by an evil spellcaster of at least 21st 
level or an evil outsider of at least 21 HD.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Class Skills</b></p>
<p class="size2">The warlord of utterdark's class skills (and the key 
ability for each skill) are Alchemy (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), 
Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), 
Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), 
Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Move Silently 
(Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Scry (Int), and Spellcraft (Int). 
See Chapter 4: Skills in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for skill descriptions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skill Points at Each Level:</b> 4 + Int modifier.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<p class="size2">All of the following are class features of the warlord of utterdark prestige class.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>A warlord of utterdark gains proficiency with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Darkvision (Ex):</b> At 1st level, the warlord of 
utterdark gains darkvision 120 feet. This overlaps (but does not stack 
with) any darkvision the character may already possess.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bulwark of Evil (Su):</b> The warlord of utterdark 
gains a +1 profane bonus to saves against good spells. All evil allies 
within 30 feet of the warlord share this save bonus. The profane bonus 
increases by +1 every four levels thereafter (+2 at 5th level, +3 at 9th
 level, and so on).</p>
<p class="size2">The warlord of utterdark radiates evil as if he were an evil outsider.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Vile</b><b>Strike (Ex): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, 
the warlord of utterdark deals 1 additional point of vile damage with 
any weapon or natural weapon attack. This additional vile damage 
increases by 1 additional point for every four levels gained thereafter 
(6th, 10th, and so on).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dark God's Blessing (Su):</b> At 3rd level, the 
warlord of utterdark can apply a +5 luck bonus to a single attack roll, 
skill check, ability check, or saving throw once per day. Using this 
ability is a free action but must be declared before the roll is made.</p>
<p class="size2">At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, the 
warlord of utterdark can call upon this blessing one additional time per
 day (twice at 7th level, three times at 11th, four times at 15th, and 
so on).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bonus Feats:</b> The warlord of utterdark gains a 
bonus feat at 4th level and an additional bonus feat every 4 levels 
thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and so on). These bonus feats must be 
selected from the following list: Armor Skin, Damage Reduction, 
Devastating Critical, Epic Leadership, Epic Poison Crafter (new feat; 
see above), Epic Prowess, Epic Reputation, Epic Toughness, Epic Weapon 
Focus, Epic Will, Improved Darkvision, Legendary Commander, Overwhelming
 Critical, Perfect Health.</p>
