 introduced a large number of new dragons to the game. Some of these are
 true dragons (such as the Chaos dragon and the Styx dragon), but many 
are lesser dragons, which are dragons that do not grow more powerful as 
they grow older. Sample lesser dragons from the <i>Draconomicon</i> 
include the spiked felldrake and the dragonnel. A few of these, 
particularly the larger varieties of landwyrm, can challenge epic-level 
characters, but once you get higher than 25th level or so all that 
remains to challenge you are a small handful of true dragons (such as 
the force dragon). This article presents two new lesser dragons that can
 pose a threat to higher level epic characters.</p>

<p align="left"><i>This monstrous reptilian behemoth has scales that 
seem to be made of ice. Ridges of ice run down its back, and jagged 
horns on its head glitter coldly. The creature's massive jaws are filled
 with teeth the size of trees.</i></p>
<p align="left">The unbelievably huge glacierdrak is thought to be a 
variation of the tundra landwyrm; in truth, the glacierdrak bears 
several superficial resemblance to the other landwyrms. The glacierdrak 
cannot fly, and, like the landwyrm, its mere presence inspires terror. 
But the glacierdrak is, if anything, even more primeval than the other 
landwyrms, and it barely acts as anything more than a monstrous force of
 destruction. Certainly, other landwyrms are quick to deride the 
glacierdrak's notorious lack of intellect, but the fact remains that the
 glacierdrak is a monstrously powerful and dangerous foe.</p>
<p align="left">Glacierdraks understand a few words of Draconic, but they generally have little interest in conversation.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">A glacierdrak, despite its size, has a shockingly 
effective ability to hide. Onlookers can easily mistake a motionless 
glacierdrak for a glacier or mountain of ice. When the creature attacks,
 it moves to crush large concentrations of smaller enemies and lashes 
out at single targets all around with its physical attacks. Generally 
too stupid to retreat from combat, a glacierdrak is not often put in a 
position where retreat is a wise tactical move.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Freezing Gaze (Su):</b> A glacierdrak's gaze has the 
terrible power to freeze opponents solid. This gaze weapon has a range 
of 120 feet, and any creature that succumbs to it immediately takes 6d6 
points of temporary Dexterity damage as its limbs and muscles freeze. A 
successful Fortitude save (DC 37) negates the Dexterity damage for that 
round. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left">When a creature with 0 Dexterity (or no Dexterity) is 
subjected to the gaze again, it takes temporary Constitution damage 
instead of Dexterity damage. Creatures killed in this manner are 
permanently frozen solid; even application of fire cannot thaw them. A 
frozen creature cannot be brought back to life by <i>raise dead</i>. 
Creatures that are immune to cold are immune to this attack, but those 
with resistance to cold are affected fully. Creatures with cold 
vulnerability take a -4 penalty on the saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b> Whenever a glacierdrak 
attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature in a 500-foot radius 
that has fewer HD than it does must make a DC 37 Will save. Failure 
indicates that the creature is panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it has 4 or 
fewer HD) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or more HD).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stunning Strike (Ex):</b> Any creature that is 
critically hit by a glacierdrak's bite or claw attack must make a DC 50 
Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 2d6 rounds. The save DC is 
Strength-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ice Glide (Su):</b> A glacierdrak can move through 
frozen liquid as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing 
leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and it does not create any ripple or 
other signs of its presence. A glacierdrak cannot burrow through other 
solid materials.</p>

<p align="left"><i>This pallid creature looks like a long, skeletally 
thin dragon. Its head has large, lidless, solid white orbs for eyes, and
 numerous bones that look almost like ribs protrude along its head and 
shoulders. The creature's mouth is more like a cruelly hooked beak, and 
it contains three long rows of bony ridges instead of teeth. A massive 
pair of wings with hundreds of tiny bone barbs along the edges fan from 
its back, and it balances on its legless body. Its body eventually 
splits into three separate tails, each of which is covered with numerous
 bony barbs like those on the wings. The cloying stink of open graves 
exudes from the creature, and lumps of soggy earth seem constantly to 
dribble from its body.</i></p>
<p align="left">The gravewyrm is a truly fearsome foe that lurks in 
massive graveyards and battlefields found on the Outer Planes, 
particularly those found on the Lower Planes where the Blood War has 
raged for countless eons. This dragon feeds on the negative energy that 
animates undead creatures, and while one may suppose that its ravenous 
appetite for the undead might make it an ally of good, nothing could be 
further from the truth. The gravewyrm prefers freshly created undead, 
and it takes great delight in transforming living victims into undead so
 it can feast on their dead twitching bodies.</p>
<p align="left">Yet gravewyrms are not driven solely by hunger. They are
 quite intelligent and have forceful, imposing personalities. Many 
gravewyrms establish massive empires on the sites of huge battlefields 
or planar necropolises, where they are served by their own armies of 
undead deemed too old for proper consumption. Many gravewyrms seek 
portals to the Material Plane and send their undead armies through to 
harvest the living; countless civilizations through the ages have been 
depopulated in a manner of weeks by these unholy attentions.</p>
<p align="left">Gravewyrms prefer to speak Draconic, but they usually know a large number of additional languages as well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">Although gravewyrms are empire builders, they relish the
 act of combat since it is the best way to get to fresh undead created 
by its breath weapon. As a result, they are quick to enter a battle 
alongside their undead minions rather than direct the battle from afar. 
In combat, a gravewyrm opens with its breath weapon and then follows up 
with its physical attacks. A gravewyrm often deliberately surrounds 
itself with its foes so it can make full use of feats like Improved 
Whirlwind Attack. Its spell-like abilities are used against those few 
foes it has trouble dealing with in physical combat, and the abilities 
also help it prepare itself for battle.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 90-ft. cone of negative energy, damage 3d6 negative levels; Reflex DC 57 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Command Undead (Su):</b> A gravewyrm commands undead as a 60th-level cleric. It can use this ability at will.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Death Knell Aura</b><b>(Su):</b> Any living creature 
reduced to negative hit points within a 30-foot-radius of a gravewyrm 
must make a Fortitude save (DC 57) or immediately suffer the effects of a
 <i>death knell</i> as if cast by the gravewyrm at caster level 60. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> Living creatures hit by a 
gravewyrm's melee attacks gain four negative levels. The DC is 63 for 
the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. The save DC is 
Charisma-based. For each such negative level bestowed, the gravewyrm 
gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>detect undead</i>, <i>displacement</i>, <i>greater teleport, haste</i>, <i>inflict critical wounds </i>(DC 27). 3/day -- <i>destruction</i> (DC 30), <i>heal</i>, <i>harm</i> (DC 29), <i>wail of the banshee</i> (DC 32). 1/day -- <i>demise unseen</i> (DC 33). Caster level 60th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)</b>: Negative energy damage heals a gravewyrm as if it were an undead creature.</p>
