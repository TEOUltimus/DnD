<p class="size2"> Some characters pursue a prestige class not simply to 
gain new abilities, but to change into another form of being. These 
classes, sometimes called "transformational" prestige classes, include 
such varied options as the alienist, the oozemaster, and the fang of 
Lolth. Unlike most prestige classes, these classes are constructed with 
an end in mind: the transformation into another type of creature. For 
this reason, they don't lend themselves to an epic progression as 
readily as the simpler prestige classes.</p>
<p class="size2">For one thing, transformational classes don't always 
demonstrate clear patterns of class feature improvement. Even when they 
do, the pattern may not be open-ended -- it may lead only to the 
"destination" of the final transformation -- or it may not be balanced 
for infinite progression.</p>
<p class="size2">Secondly, there's the simple question of "How does the 
character become more of creature type X than he already is?" Once 
you've become an outsider, a dragon, a vermin, or (Pelor help you) an 
ooze, what's left to accomplish?</p>
<p class="size2">This column answers those questions for three transformational prestige classes from <i>Tome and Blood</i>,
 presenting an epic progression of each: the acolyte of the skin, the 
dragon disciple, and the elemental savant. In each case, I show some of 
the thought that went into the design, giving you a "behind the curtain"
 look at how I built these unique epic progressions, and where I had to 
bend the existing guidelines. Use these examples to help guide your 
creation of other transformational prestige class epic progressions. 
Players and DMs should work together to create interesting, exciting 
epic versions of these very special classes.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2012-08%20-%20Transformational%20Prestige%20Class%20Epic%20Progressions_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Acolyte of the Skin (Outsider)</b></p>
<p class="size2">By 10th level, the acolyte of the skin is permanently 
bonded to his fiendish epidermis, transforming his type to outsider. He 
has a +2 natural armor bonus, a +2 modifier to Dexterity and 
Constitution, cold and fire resistance 20, 120-ft. darkvision, and a 
variety of supernatural and spell-like abilities related to his fiendish
 nature. However, other than the character's spells-per-day progression 
and bonus feats, no clear pattern of ability gain exists.</p>
<p class="size2">Therefore, to continue the acolyte's "journey" into 
fiendishness, we must extrapolate additional class features for the 
character. We can do this by examining the half-fiend template, as well 
as the common powers possessed by demons and devils.</p>
<p class="size2">A half-fiend has the following ability modifiers: Str 
+4, Dex +4, Con +2, Int +4, and Cha +2, which substantially exceeds what
 the acolyte gains. Occasional ability modifiers might be a good place 
to start for class features. </p>
<p class="size2">In addition, the half-fiend has a list of a dozen 
potential spell-like abilities, only two of which (poison and summon 
fiend) the acolyte shares in any form, as well as poison immunity and 
acid and electricity resistance 20. Here, then, are other good options 
for the epic character. </p>
<p class="size2">Looking at demons and devils, we find that telepathic 
communication is a common ability. They tend to have high Strength and 
Constitution, and many are highly intelligent, wise, or charismatic (or 
all three). </p>
<p class="size2">From these elements we put together a reasonable epic class progression for the acolyte of the skin.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Die:</b> d4.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> The epic acolyte's caster level 
increases by 1 every even-numbered level gained above 10th. In addition,
 at every even-numbered level, the epic acolyte of the skin gains new 
spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting
 class he belonged to before he added the prestige class, up to the 
number of spells per day possessed by a 20th-level character of that 
class.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Physical Power (Ex):</b> At 11th level, and every 10
 levels thereafter, the epic acolyte of the skin gains a permanent +2 
bonus to Strength or Constitution (character's choice).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Poison Immunity (Ex):</b> The epic acolyte of the skin becomes immune to poison at 11th level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fiendish Heritage (Sp):</b> At 13th level, and every
 4 levels thereafter (17th, 21st, and so on), the acolyte of the skin 
gains one daily use of each of the following powers: <i>desecrate</i>, <i>unholy blight</i>, and <i>blasphemy</i>. Use the character's acolyte of the skin level as the caster level. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Acid Resistant (Ex):</b> At 14th level, the fiendish skin grants acid resistance 20. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Improved Symbiosis:</b> At 15th level, and every 5 
levels thereafter, the enhancement bonus needed to bypass the damage 
reduction of the epic acolyte of the skin increases by +1 (to DR 20/+2 
at 15th level, DR 20/+3 at 20th level, and so forth).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Mental Power (Ex):</b> At 16th level, and every 10 
levels thereafter, the epic acolyte of the skin gains a permanent +2 
bonus to Intelligence or Charisma (character's choice).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Electricity Resistant (Ex):</b> At 18th level, the fiendish skin grants electricity resistance 20. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Telepathy (Su):</b> A 19th-level acolyte of the skin can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bonus Feats:</b> The epic acolyte of the skin gains a
 bonus feat (selected from the list of epic acolyte of the skin feats) 
every 4 levels after 8th.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Epic Acolyte of the Skin Bonus Feat List:</i> Armor 
Skin, Energy Resistance, Epic Spell Penetration, Epic Toughness, 
Extended Life Span, Improved Combat Casting, Improved Darkvision, 
Improved Spell Capacity, Spell Knowledge.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Dragon Disciple (Dragon)</b></p>
<p class="size2">Perhaps the most symbolic of the transformational 
prestige classes, the path of the dragon disciple allows a character to 
become the most iconic monster of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game: a dragon. </p>
<p class="size2">Along the way to reaching dragon apotheosis, the dragon
 disciple gains claw and bite attacks, natural armor, wings, size, and, 
of course, a breath weapon. But in most cases, these are only pale 
reflections of the power of a true dragon. This suggests that the best 
route for the epic dragon disciple is to improve upon his already 
formidable draconic powers.</p>
<p class="size2">Because the dragon disciple's bonus spell progression 
doesn't follow an easily discernible pattern, and because the class is 
quite potent enough without it, the epic progression presented below 
does not continue the bonus spells. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Die:</b> d12.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Natural Armor: </b>At 11th level, and every 3 levels
 thereafter, the dragon disciple's natural armor bonus increases by +1 
(to +5 at 11th, +6 at 14th, and so on).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wing Slam:</b> At 12th level, the dragon disciple 
gains the ability to make two wing slam attacks each round (assuming he 
is at least Medium-size). Wing attacks deal the damage listed in the 
table below plus one-half the dragon disciple's Strength bonus, and are 
at a -5 penalty to the attack bonus.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon Increase:</b> At 13th level, and every
 3 levels thereafter, the epic dragon disciple's breath weapon increases
 in power and frequency of use. The damage dealt by the breath weapon 
increases by 2 dice (if it deals 6 dice of damage at 10th level) or by 1
 die (if it deals 3 dice of damage at 10th level). The additional dice 
are of the same type normally dealt by the dragon disciple's breath 
weapon. In addition, the save DC for the breath weapon increases by 1 
point, and the range increases as shown in the table below. Finally, the
 dragon disciple gains one additional daily use of his breath weapon, 
though he must wait 1d4 rounds before each use.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Enlargement:</b> At 15th level, and every 10 levels 
thereafter, the dragon disciple's size increases by one step (such as 
from Large to Huge), to a maximum of Colossal size. The change in size 
affects the dragon disciple's base natural weapon damage (see below). 
Apply the appropriate new size modifier to the character's attacks and 
AC.</p>
<p class="size2">If the dragon disciple is already Colossal, he instead gains a +2 bonus to Strength.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Slap:</b> At 17th level, the dragon disciple 
grows a serpentine tail that he can use to deliver tail slap attacks. A 
tail slap deals the listed damage plus 1 1/2 times the dragon disciple's
 Strength bonus and is at a -5 penalty to the attack bonus.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell Resistance (Ex):</b> The 18th-level dragon disciple gains spell resistance equal to 20 + his class level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> The dragon disciple gains 
blindsight at 20th level, allowing him to ascertain creatures by 
nonvisual means just as a dragon does. The range of this ability is 30 
feet at 20th level, and it increases by 30 feet every 10 levels 
thereafter. </p>

<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2012-08%20-%20Transformational%20Prestige%20Class%20Epic%20Progressions_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Elemental Savant (Elemental)</b></p>
<p class="size2">At first glance, the elemental savant seems to make for
 an easy epic progression. Her resistance, elemental focus, and 
elemental penetration all follow regular patterns of improvement over 
the 10 levels of the class, suggesting that all one needs to do to 
continue into epic levels is continue the patterns.</p>
<p class="size2">Unfortunately, this is one of those places where the guidelines in the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i>
 simply don't work. Since the elemental savant gains total immunity to 
her chosen energy type at 10th level, continued improvement of her 
energy resistance serves no purpose. And if we simply grant an 
additional +1 to save DCs and spell penentration checks every 3 levels, 
these numbers quickly outstrip anything obtainable by other 
spellcasters. By the 20th level of elemental savant (minimum 30th-level 
character), the save DCs for her chosen energy type will be 7 points 
higher than those of a typical wizard or sorcerer (turning a difficult 
save into a near-impossible one), and a typical creature's spell 
resistance simply won't offer more than a speed bump.</p>
<p class="size2">That's not to say that these features can't continue to
 improve -- they just have to do so more slowly than at non-epic levels.
 And in addition, we can peruse the elementals in the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 for other options. Certainly the save DC against her special elemental 
attacks (whirlwind, burn, or vortex) can continue to improve. The 
ability to transform into an elemental seems like a natural ability to 
grant, as is damage reduction and other powers traditionally associated 
with elementals.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Die:</b> d4.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> The epic elemental savant's caster level
 increases by 1 every level gained above 10th. In addition, at every 
level, the epic elemental savant gains new spells per day as if she had 
also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to 
before she added the prestige class, up to the number of spells per day 
possessed by a 20th-level character of that class.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Elemental Special Attacks:</b> The save DC against 
the epic elemental savant's special attacks (whirlwind, burn, or vortex)
 is equal to 20 + 1/2 her number of class levels above 10th + Con 
modifier. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Elemental Transformation (Su): </b>At 11th level, the elemental savant gains the ability to <i>shapechange</i>
 into a Large or smaller elemental of her chosen type (air, earth, fire,
 or water) once per day as a sorcerer of her class level. She also gains
 the elemental's supernatural special attacks and special qualities.</p>
<p class="size2">For every 3 additional levels gained above 11th, the savant can <i>shapechange</i> one additional time per day (twice at 14th, three times at 17th, and so on).</p>
<p class="size2">For every 5 additional levels gained above 11th, the
