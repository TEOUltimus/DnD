<p class="size2"> While the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> contains plenty 
of guidelines and advice for running an epic-level game, certain issues 
may arise that force the DM into the unwanted role of discouraging or 
limiting certain effects, both on his side and the players' side. While 
that can be a reasonable solution for groups willing to look past the 
letter of the rules in favor of the spirit of an enjoyable game, it's 
not always enough simply to say, "Hey, stop casting <i>harm</i> on every dragon you meet!"</p>
<p class="size2">That's where the variants presented in this column come
 in handy. Each one tackles a different potentially problematic issue in
 epic-level spellcasting. In most cases, these issues crop up simply 
because of the "no limits" approach to epic-level play. There's really 
nothing wrong with any of the spells or feats listed below in a non-epic
 game, though at higher levels you may see hints as to larger problems 
looming.</p>
<p class="size2">If you've been frustrated by any of these situations, 
discuss the variant rule presented with the rest of the gaming group and
 consider trying it out for a session or two to see if it lets you get 
back to a more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Epic Variant: No "Save or Die" Spells</b></p>
<p class="size2">By the time characters reach epic levels, spells that 
kill the target on a failed save ("save or die" spells) can swing an 
encounter dramatically on the basis of a single roll. These spells have 
an effect that dramatically outweighs that of other spells of similar 
level, because death effects generally don't care about your level or 
hit points. Effectively, these spells get more powerful as their targets
 become more powerful. (Some spells, such as <i>circle of death</i> or <i>power word, kill </i>affect
 creatures up to a maximum HD or hit point value only, which means that 
they have a built-in upper limit of destructive power.) </p>
<p class="size2">If you want to downplay the swing factor of save or die
 spells, consider altering the spells listed below as described. In each
 case, the "death" effect is replaced by dice of damage, allowing 
extraordinarily powerful targets to withstand such spells even on a 
failed save. This means that you're better off wearing down a tough foe 
for a few rounds before hitting it with a save or die spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Destruction:</i> Instead of simply destroying the 
target on a failed save, this spell deals 20d6 points of damage plus 1d6
 points of damage per caster level, with no upper limit to its damage. 
If this damage reduces the target to 0 or fewer hit points, the target 
is destroyed utterly, as described in the spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Disintegrate:</i> On a failed save, this spell deals
 20d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage per caster level, with 
no upper limit to its damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 or 
fewer hit points, the target is disintegrated, as described in the 
spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Finger of Death:</i> On a failed save, this spell 
deals 20d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage per caster level, 
with no upper limit to its damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0
 or fewer hit points, the target is slain.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Implosion:</i> Each target that fails its save 
against this spell suffers 20d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of 
damage per caster level, with no upper limit to its damage. If this 
damage reduces the target to 0 or fewer hit points, the target is 
killed, as described in the spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Prismatic Sphere</i>, and so on: The green (poison) 
layer (or ray) deals 20d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage per
 caster level on a failed save, with no upper limit to its damage. If 
this damage reduces the target to 0 or fewer hit points, the target is 
killed, as described in the spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Slay Living:</i> See <i>finger of death</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Wail of the Banshee:</i> See <i>implosion</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Epic Variant: Limited<i> Harm</i> and <i>Heal </i>Effects</b></p>
<p class="size2">Few spells in the game see as much heated discussion as
 these two. Much like the save or die effects listed above, these spells
 continue to get more and more powerful as their targets gain levels 
(and hit points).</p>
<p class="size2">If your group isn't satisfied with the ever-escalating 
power of these spells, consider changing them to deal (or cure) 10 hit 
points per caster level, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level. (In 
the case of <i>harm</i>, the spell can't reduce the target below 1 hit 
point.) This allows the spells to retain their role as extraordinarily 
potent damage-dealing (or damage-curing) effects, while limiting them 
from wiping out or restoring several hundred hit points in a single 
touch.</p>
<p class="size2">Along the same lines, the <i>heal mount</i> spell would
 cure 10 hit points per caster level, to a maximum of 100 hit points at 
10th level (since it's a lower-level spell than <i>heal</i>). <i>Mass heal</i> would have a maximum of 250 hit points cured at 25th level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Maximum Spell Effects</b></p>
<p class="size2">Some spells in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> have 
effects based on caster level but don't list a "cap" to these effects. 
Consider adding the following maximum spell effect caps to your game to 
keep these spells in line with their appropriate power level.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Augury:</i> The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% +1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90% at 20th level or higher.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Bigby's Clenched Fist/Bigby's Grasping Hand:</i> The
 attack bonus of either spell is equal to your level up to 20th, then +1
 per 2 levels thereafter. (Effectively, the attack bonus is equal to the
 base attack bonus of a fighter of your caster level.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Circle of Doom: </i>This spell is listed as dealing a
 maximum of 1d8+20 points of damage. This limit should probably be 
1d8+25, since it's a level higher than <i>inflict critical wounds</i> (which also has a maximum of +20).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Creeping Doom:</i> It seems hard to believe that a 
spell that covers a 20-foot-diameter spread could inflict its full 
damage on a single target within it in any given round. After all, not 
all of vermin are in each square, so it's not possible for the spell to 
inflict all 1,000 points of damage to, say, a single human unlucky 
enough to be the lone creature within its area. This spell fills 12 
squares, so each square would have no more than (1,000 divided by 12) 
roughly 80 stinging bugs. For simplicity's sake, you could round this to
 an even 100, meaning that <i>creeping doom</i> would inflict a maximum 
of 100 points of damage in each 5-foot square per round. Thus, a human 
could suffer no more than 100 points of damage per round (since he takes
 up only a single square), while a cloud giant (who fills a 
10-foot-by-10-foot area, or four full squares) could suffer 400 points 
of damage per round. (Remember that since each point of damage comes 
from a separate source, this damage doesn't force a Fortitude save to 
avoid death from massive damage.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Fire Shield:</i> The damage dealt to attackers should top out at 1d6+20 points of damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Harm:</i> See "Limited<i> Harm</i> and <i>Heal </i>Effects," above.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Heal:</i> See "Limited<i> Harm</i> and <i>Heal </i>Effects," above.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Heal Mount:</i> See "Limited<i> Harm</i> and <i>Heal </i>Effects," above.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Healing Circle</i>: Like <i>circle of doom</i>, this spell should probably top out at 1d8+25 points, rather than 1d8+20.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Mass Heal:</i> See "Limited<i> Harm</i> and <i>Heal </i>Effects," above.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Protection from Elements:</i> This spell doesn't 
list a maximum amount of damage absorbed. As a 3rd-level spell, it could
 top out as low as 10th level (120 points), but it wouldn't be terribly 
unbalanced to allow it to top out at 20th level (240 points).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Regenerate:</i> This spell should probably cure a maximum of 1d8+35 points, rather than 1d8+20.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Spell Resistance</i>: The maximum spell resistance granted by this spell should be 37 at 25th level. </p>
<p class="size2"><i>Tenser's Transformation</i>: The caster of the spell
 gains 1d6 temporary hit points per level and a +1 base attack bonus per
 two levels, up to a maximum of 20d6 temporary hit points and a +10 base
 attack bonus at 20th level. After all, beyond 20th level, the fighter 
and wizard both increase base attack bonus at the same rate, and this 
spell is designed to give the wizard a fighter's base attack bonus.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Wall of Ice:</i> Just as for <i>wall of</i><i>fire</i>, a creature passing through a wall of ice should suffer a maximum of 1d6+20 points of damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Epic Variant: Nonstacking Metamagic</b></p>
<p class="size2">A few metamagic feats -- Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, 
and Extend Spell -- can be applied to a single spell multiple times, 
stacking its increased effect again and again. When casters are limited 
to slots up to 9th level, this doesn't pose too much of a problem -- you
 can empower a <i>bull's strength</i> only three times before you run into the top limit of your spellcasting powers.</p>
<p class="size2">But as epic-level characters gain spell slots of 10th, 
12th, 15th, or higher levels, the stacking nature of these metamagic 
feats can grow out of control. To address this situation, consider 
limiting all metamagic feats to no more than one application per feat 
slot spent on the feat. A character who wanted to empower a <i>fireball</i> twice would thus have to take the Empower Spell feat twice.</p>
<p class="size2">This may seem overly harsh to players who have grown 
used to quadrupling the range of their spells with multiple stacking 
applications of Enlarge Spell, or dramatically increasing the damage 
output of their lightning bolts with Empower Spell. As a compromise, 
consider alternative limits, such as a maximum of two applications per 
feat slot spent. The DM and players should work together to find a happy
 medium where both sides are comfortable with the outcome.</p>
