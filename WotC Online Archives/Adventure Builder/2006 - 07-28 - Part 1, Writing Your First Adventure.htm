 you are ready to design your first RPG adventure, or learn how to 
improve the adventures you've already got, you've come to the right 
place. The "Adventure Builder" will cover all the bases, from hooks to 
background to traps and treasures.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This time out, we'll cover the foundation you need to 
build a great adventure. It's not the background, the stat blocks, or 
even the main villain. It's monster selection, and figuring out the size
 and style of the adventure. </p>
<p class="size4" align="LEFT"><b>How Big is Your Design?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> A common rule of thumb among the Wizards of the Coast 
design staff is that a typical group of adventurers will level up after 
about 13 successful encounters of the party's encounter level (EL). 
That's a great number to work from, especially if you want to design a 
large adventure that spans multiple levels.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In an adventure with dozens of encounters, the party 
will level up half-way through. Since the party will be tougher and more
 capable from that point on, the adventure you've planned for them needs
 too scale up as well. It's better to scale up the second half of the 
adventure appropriately, but if you don't want the PCs to level up 
midway through your epic you can prevent it by keeping your number of 
encounters small or by lowering their EL (to reduce the XP per 
encounter).</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the same time, just because you map an encounter 
doesn't mean that it will be played. Some areas are never explored, 
after all, and not every encounter leads to combat (some are resolved or
 defeated through stealth, magic, bribery, or roleplaying). So if you do
 want the PCs to level up after your adventure then you'll need more 
than 13 party-level encounters to provide enough options and fallbacks 
if the party doesn't follow the expected path.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So, not too many encounters and not too few. As a 
general idea, you want to prepare about 20 to 25 encounters for your 
party per level of advancement. If you prefer mostly lower EL 
encounters, perhaps closer to 25 to 30. If you run marathon play 
sessions every weekend, you might want to prepare 40 to 50 encounters 
ahead of time, and assume the second half will be at a higher level. If 
you run short game sessions, you'll want to make sure that the adventure
 breaks into small sections of 3 or 4 encounters with a satisfying 
conclusion to each.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now you know how many encounters you should prepare. 
What should be in those encounters? And what mistakes should you watch 
out for?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Common design mistakes </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> There are four fairly common errors in beginning adventure design. When I worked on <i>Dungeon</i> magazine I saw them constantly, and the errors haven't changed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">1) too much useless backstory<br> 2) slow starts<br> 3) random encounters<br> 4) too many encounters </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">Each of these is easy to fix. Here's how you do it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Simple Backstory</b>: Most DMs and designers hate to 
hear it, but much of the time lavished on history and background is 
wasted energy. Players never find out who dug the tomb, how the wizard 
was betrayed by her apprentice, or why the assassin guild changed sides 
and disappeared. Working on backstory doesn't improve the gameplay 
experience for anyone but the bards and scholars obsessed with legends 
or lore. Unless it connects directly to action in the current timeframe 
(and the PCs have a way of learning it), skip the involved history. Save
 that for sourcebooks. </p>
<p align="LEFT">This is not to say cut it all. Details of which faction 
can be turned against another, which guard might take a bribe, or what 
the villain ultimately plans to do if the party doesn't stop him are all
 appropriate. Make sure your backstory is recent and relevant; avoid 
anything that starts "Thousands of years ago..."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Start the Action Quickly</b>: When players arrive at 
the game, they are looking to roll some dice. You can start the action 
immediately and draw the players away from pizza and other distractions 
by giving them what they want: a short, simple combat encounter to start
 off the game. Ideally, the encounter is pitched at an encounter level 
(EL) no more than one level above or below the party's level.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The best of the "start in midstream" kick-offs are aimed
 at all the PCs when they are together, and raise questions that lead 
the party to the adventure hook. For instance, the party might see 
raiders attacking an inn where they had planned to spend the night -- 
survivors of the attack tell the party about the black knight who leads 
them. Or a teleporting extraplanar threat might appear during broad 
daylight and accuse a cleric of breaking his vows -- and threaten to 
sacrifice his corrupt church elders to a greater power. Where these 
encounters go ultimately isn't the most important thing: they can be a 
little tangential to the plot, as long as they get the party thinking of
 the right sort of threat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I'll discuss this in more detail next time in "Adventure Hooks.".</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Don't Be Random</b>: Time is precious, so be careful 
how many tangents and red herrings you include in your design. In 
particular, random encounters might be fun, or can be useful to get a 
dawdling party going, or to work off that frustration players sometimes 
get where they just need to have their characters kill something, but 
they don't usually make your adventure any better. If they are tied into
 the core adventure, then they shouldn't be random at all; those clues 
should be built in to the design. If they aren't tied in to the 
adventure core, then you are just wasting game time on an encounter that
 doesn't advance the mission or the story goals for you or your players.
 </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trim Excess Encounters</b>: If you create too many 
encounters and you don't play every day, players forget what their 
mission was, or start to lose hope of making progress. They wind up 
grinding through so many nuisance encounters that they lose sight of the
 important clues, or they don't talk to the important NPC, or they don't
 search the critical room for documents -- because they are too busy 
grinding through combats. If the encounters are just there to fill up 
space on a map, they might as well be random. Leave some rooms empty to 
speed up play.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Encounter Selection: Fitting Together a Cast</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The real challenge is balancing encounters to present a
 variety of challenges for every member of the party. The adventure, 
after all, is a chance for the heroes to triumph over opposition (or 
fail miserably and go home). </p>
<p align="LEFT">Selecting for a Coherent Look and Feel</p>
<p align="LEFT">Story, setting, and immersion are all easier to pull off
 if your monsters fit a theme. That theme might be "united tribes of 
humanoids" or it might be "desert raiders", but either way it cuts out 
many choices. Avoid the kitchen sink approach of just taking creatures 
that match the party level. Instead, make good use of the EL chart in 
the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> (page 49) to create encounters of small groups, pairs of monsters, and single creatures.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In particular, consider linked encounters for your cast.
 A guard dog or a sentry might be a much lower EL encounter from a 
combat perspective -- but if the party fails to use a silence spell or a
 sneak attack to take it out quickly then it could make later encounters
 more difficult.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Balancing by EL and by Class</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> offers direct advice 
on how many easy, challenging, very difficult, and overwhelming 
encounters a typical adventure should contain (see page 49). Hint: not 
many overwhelming encounters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While this breakdown is good advice, it's not complete. 
You'll want to be sure that your 20 or 25 encounters include encounter 
variety by class as well as by EL. That is, make sure to include each of
 the following types of encounters, to give every class and every player
 a chance to shine.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2007-28%20-%20Part%201,%20Writing%20Your%20First%20Adventure_files/dx0728ab_AD1_skills.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="515" width="216"><b>1) Two Skill Encounters</b>:
 These are creatures or obstacles that can be defeated by stealth or 
skill, such as guards, castle walls, cliffs, informants, or low-hp 
creatures that can fall to a single sneak attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>2) Four Pure Combats</b>: You need some 
no-negotiation, straight-up combats that play to the fighter classes. 
Think orcs, wolves, ogres, giants -- or dragons. Consider tactics first 
here: ambushes, charge, bull-rush, something to make it more than just 
attack rolls and damage rolls.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>3) Two Magical Challenges</b>: Include two magical challenges that require a <i>knock</i>, a <i>fireball</i>,
 or whatever other strengths your arcane spellcasters have. They might 
be lore-based challenges, such as knowing the weaknesses of an 
extraplanar creature, or they might require the use of Concentration or 
Spellcraft to manipulate a magical object or unravel a mysterious 
warding.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>4) One Divine Challenge</b>: The divine caster in the
 party is more than just a medic, so give him or her something to do 
with at least one undead turning, Knowledge (Religion), or 
nature-knowledge encounter (if your divine caster is a druid).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>5) One Puzzle or Trap</b>: This could be as simple as
 finding the key to a tough lock, deciphering an ancient script, or 
finding a secret door with Search, but you should include traps and 
puzzles for your party to solve. If the party doesn't have a rogue in 
it, use Knowledge skill checks as a substitute.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>6) Two Roleplaying Encounters</b>: Social skills play
 an important part of the game too, and bards don't like to just sit and
 do their stuff in the background. Provide at least two roleplaying 
encounters that can be defeated by the right social skills, bribes, 
exchange of services, or clever conversation. Examples include a scholar
 with a clue that the party needs to bypass some defenses or wardings, 
or a devil who will ally with them against a common foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>7) One Mook Encounter</b>: This should be against 
foes of at least 2 CR less than the party, and ideally 3 or 4 less. 
Think kobolds, bandits, skeletons, wild animals, or any other group of 
many foes that play to Cleave and area-effect spells. It's fun to see 
heroes cutting a swath through hordes of foes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>8) One Polder</b>: "Polder" is a Dutch word describing land reclaimed from the sea, but here it's a more general term. As described in detail in <i>Dungeon</i> 135, polders are safe havens for adventurers, places where the party can regain strength. Think Rivendell in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.
 Your polder could be a xenophobic elven tree city, a magical rope that 
generates rope trick spells as a charged item, a bound archon who wards a
 treasure, or a dwarven merchant caravan. If the party wishes, they can 
heal up to full strength and level up.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>9) One Bigger Fish</b>: To keep the blood flowing, 
you should have one overwhelming encounter that the party can't handle 
without serious risk of a total party kill. This could turn into a 
roleplaying bit of Diplomacy, a chase, or a stealth challenge, depending
 on how the party handles it -- but they should see that not every 
encounter in every adventure should be fought.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>10) Big Finish</b>: A grand finale encounter with all
 the trimmings: villain, minions, and a room or terrain that provides 
interesting combat options.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That list of recommended encounter types covers 17 
encounters out of the 20 to 25 in your adventure, but you could easily 
double up on any of those categories. For example, if you know that the 
players like intense combat you could set up the remaining encounters as
 pure combats. If you know that your arcane caster is itching for a 
magical duel -- or that the rogue will always try reconnaissance first 
-- prepare those kinds of encounters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Tailoring an adventure to show the heroes in the best 
light means more fun for everyone. Making an adventure that plays to the
 party's weakness might be fun for you, but will only frustrate your 
players. Don't take away their spells, sneak attacks, or combat items 
very often -- those are the tools of heroism and the key to fun. 
Instead, give those strong points a challenge and a chance to shine.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To further tailor an adventure, consider some special 
encounter types if you have, say, a mounted knight, an archer, a monk, 
or a paladin in the group. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">1) A mounted encounter<br> 2) A ranged attack encounter<br> 3) A chase (see <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i> page 57 for chase rules), either hunting or being pursued.<br> 4) A single-combat encounter or challenge from an honorable foe<br>
 5) Another class-specific encounter, such as one that requires bardic 
song, barbarian tracking, or fighting a ranger's favored enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Adventures work if they are fun and easy to play, and 
give every kind of hero a chance to shine in different encounter styles.
 The most important part of design isn't the details of a stat block, 
but the type and variety of opponents and encounters. </p>
