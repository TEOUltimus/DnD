<p align="left">If that's the attitude of your gaming group, you may not
 be designing your roleplaying encounters correctly. What they should be
 saying is "Oh no, it's a talk encounter. Buff the bard with <i>eagle's splendor</i>, quick!"<br>
 Wait, did I say "design your roleplaying encounters"? Sure I did. Just 
because some encounters don't need stat blocks doesn't mean that they 
don't need preparation and careful design. If anything, roleplaying 
encounters are more demanding, because you have to allow for more 
options than just combat. Preparing a satisfying roleplaying encounter 
requires some deeper thought about how your players respond to pressure,
 flattery, and so forth. </p>
<p align="left">The need for careful design is especially pressing for 
what I call switch encounters, that is, encounters that begin as 
roleplaying but that could easily become combat encounters. A devil, for
 example, could want to chat with the party before destroying them; if 
it learns that they are both seeking to bring down a group of diabolists
 serving a Demon Lord, the devil might even leave the party alone, since
 both groups seek the same goal.</p>
<p align="left">For each roleplaying encounter, you need to prepare 
three things ahead of time: what the PCs can gain from the encounter, 
what the NPC might accept in exchange, and what skills or class 
abilities will help them in the encounter.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What the Party Gains</b></p>
<p align="left">Combat encounters are easy; kill the monster, take its 
stuff. Roleplaying encounters are tougher; PCs still gain XP for 
defeating them, but it's also possible that the party will be defeated 
and not even know it. While the goal of the encounter should be clear to
 the DM at all times, the PCs may not know at the start whether they are
 dealing with a passage encounter, a resource encounter, an information 
encounter, a talk-or-fight encounter, or something else.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Passage:</b> The party gains entrance to a hidden or 
locked location, learns of an important site, or gains a pass, key, or 
password that gets them through a gate or into a secret chamber. The 
whole encounter is, essentially, an unlocking of an area that they can't
 reach without completing the interaction successfully.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Information:</b> The party gains a useful clue, 
learns a weakness to exploit in a future encounter, gains access to 
spells or books that contain crucial information about the plot or the 
major villains.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Resources:</b> Some good or neutral-aligned 
characters will offer the party treasure, healing, mounts, magic, or 
other resources if they believe that the party will serve a cause they 
both believe in. This could be a magic sword with a bane enchantment 
against a major monster type, it could be a set of healing potions, or 
it could be ancient coins to bribe an undead king into serving the party
 as a distraction while the party slips over the castle walls. In most 
adventures, there are at least some potentially friendly encounters that
 offer these sorts of treasures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Avoiding Combat:</b> Some roleplaying encounters just
 offer the opportunity to avoid spending precious spells, hit points, 
and other resources on a tough fight. In these cases, it's always best 
to signal very clearly that the monster in question can crush the party 
without a second thought. Alternately, the talking at the beginning of 
an encounter gives a villain's minions time to surround the party or 
bring up reinforcements, so that the stakes get higher and higher the 
longer the party talks -- ratcheting up the tension on the party 
spokesperson. If the parley collapses into combat, the villain will be 
in a stronger position than he was at the start. These are the "switch 
encounters" discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p align="left">Those four categories cover most roleplaying encounters. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="center"><b>Roleplaying Encounter?</b></p>
<p align="left">One of the strange terms in the D&amp;D game community 
is "roleplaying encounter," which generally means some kind of talking 
encounter. However, D&amp;D is a roleplaying game. The <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 says so in the first sentence: "This is the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 
Roleplaying Game, the game that defines the genre and has set the 
standard for fantasy roleplaying for more than 30 years." So aren't all 
encounters roleplaying encounters in a roleplaying game?</p>
<p align="left">Yes, they are.</p>
<p align="left">The word "roleplaying" means "an instance or situation 
in which one deliberately acts out or assumes a particular character or 
role" (from www.dictionary.com). When creating and playing a character 
in D&amp;D, you are always roleplaying because the character is not you.</p>
<p align="left">However, over the years there has grown a mentality in 
the community of people who play roleplaying games that a "roleplaying" 
encounter is a talking encounter whereas a combat encounter is a fight. 
In truth, a "roleplaying" encounter should be called a negotiation 
encounter or a talking encounter. But, since the majority of the 
community understands roleplaying to mean talking (as opposed to all the
 other ways you roleplay your character), this article uses the term 
"roleplaying encounter" to mean a talking encounter of some kind. Just 
remember that there are more ways to roleplay a character than merely 
through talking.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Lies and Treachery </b></p>
<p align="left">It is ridiculously easy to lead roleplayers astray, as 
many players don't seem to realize that NPCs might be lying to them. 
Villains, double agents, and slippery underworld characters might all 
have perfectly good (or perfectly dastardly) reasons for not telling the
 truth. For instance, in a talk-or-fight encounter, the villain might be
 talking only because he needs to stall for time as his slow-moving 
undead minions arrive on the scene, or while his lancers or crossbowmen 
move under cover to a flanking position or the like.</p>
<p align="left">In other cases, an NPC might seem to be helpful, but 
really is pumping the party for information. Are they planning on 
raiding the necromancer's stronghold? When? Do they know about the 
secret tunnel? Once the informant has told the party about the secret 
tunnel, of course, he might go to the necromancer and tell him that a 
raid is coming, thus selling out both sides -- and making that tunnel 
encounter much tougher, if the necromancer puts extra defenders there.</p>
<p align="left">What can a suspicious party do? Well, there are defenses such as Sense Motive skill checks and the use of a <i>detect lie</i> spell. The first of these is probably more helpful than the second.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What the Monsters Gain</b></p>
<p align="left">The creatures or characters that the party is speaking 
with also have their goals in a role-playing encounter. They might want 
food, souls, gold or other monetary bribes, flattery, a completed quest,
 or information of their own. If the monsters don't gain what they want,
 the encounter ends in failure for the party. This might mean they hear 
"I can't help you" from the scholar they consult, or it might mean that 
the giant considers them too weak to bargain with and decides to eat 
them all instead.</p>
<p align="left">For the most part, I design roleplaying encounters to 
have three stages: discovering what the monster wants, actual 
roleplaying between DM and players, and a skill check-driven resolution,
 either positive or negative. If the role-playing resolution is 
negative, the result is often combat.</p>
<p align="left">Discovering what the monsters want is usually the easy 
part; if a PC asks, most monsters will answer. Of course, most monsters 
will ask for more than the minimum. Whether the party can haggle 
successfully depends on their style and skills. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Skills and Class Abilities for Roleplaying</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2008-24%20-%20Part%203,%20Roleplaying%20and%20Switch%20Encounters_files/dx20060824ab_negotiations.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="258" width="216">The
 skill-based classes and certain prestige classes have abilities such as
 Bardic Knowledge, Artificer knowledge, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Bluff and
 the like, all of which can be useful in a roleplaying encounter. But 
how far should they go in replacing actual conversation between a player
 and DM?</p>
<p align="left">This depends on what your players enjoy. If a player has
 sunk skill ranks into these abilities, they should get use out of them.
 Likewise, characters who have sunk those ranks into something else 
shouldn't get to talk their way out of trouble if they lack the 
abilities.</p>
<p align="left">I like a two-pronged approach. First, every roleplaying encounter must include the NPC's Initial Attitude (<i>Player's Handbook</i>
 page 72). This determines how tough it is for the PCs to talk their way
 out at all -- and reminds you whether the encounter can be defeated 
through non-combat means. If the party lacks the skills to sweet-talk an
 Unfriendly or Hostile monster, then tough luck. They should fight it 
out, burning hit points, spells, and other resources in the process.</p>
<p align="left">Second, if one or more of the PCs do have the Diplomacy 
skill or Charisma checks to change a Hostile or Unfriendly monster to 
have a Neutral or better attitude, talk it out as long as you like, 
playing up the weasely informer, the moustache-twirling villain or the 
drooling monster. Have fun with the conversation, but the, at the 
crucial moment, when the informer says, "Well, I shouldn't tell you 
this...," ask the player doing most of the talking to make the Bluff, 
Diplomacy, Gather Information, or Intimidate check, as appropriate. </p>
<p align="left">Set the bar for your role-playing skill checks ahead of 
time and stick with them. The rough rule of thumb is that the DC should 
be roughly equal to 12 plus the party's level, so that a skill-based 
character with maxed-out ranks and an ability bonus expects to succeed 
75% of the time -- and a character without skill ranks and no ability 
bonus succeeds less than 50% of the time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Options</b></p>
<p align="left">What if the party doesn't contain any high-skill 
characters, or they flub a crucial roll? There are a few other options. 
Some monsters will take bribes or payoffs. Others can be avoided through
 magic or disguises. If there are any items, quests, or information an 
NPC needs, they may just demand those instead. The party is not 
necessarily defeated just because a social skill fails.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Switch Encounters: Roleplaying into Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">One of the best ways to make a combat more entertaining 
is to set it up as a roleplaying encounter first. The knight who brags 
he can spit the party members like piglets on his lance, the giant who 
toys with his food, or the evil wizard who pretends to be their friend 
before betraying them one night during the midnight watch are all 
potentially more interesting than merely rolling dice. If the party is 
going to meet one of these, prepare some dialogue ahead of time -- and 
set the initial attitude to Hostile. </p>
<p align="left">The trick to a switch encounter is simple: though he is 
hostile, the major NPC doesn't attack right away. Sure, he hates the 
party and wishes them ill, but he wants to toy with them first. The 
encounter looks like a roleplaying opportunity for the party, and it is.
 Any PC who wants to bandy words, propose single combat, insult their 
opponent's tribe and family, and so forth has time to do it. The NPC, 
though, will wait until he's good and ready before attacking -- and will
 use the time to try to arrange things in his or her favor by summoning 
henchmen, alerting the (evil or corrupt) town guards, arranging for an 
invisible assassin as backup, gaining the divine favor of evil priests, 
and so forth. </p>
<p align="left">One easy way to stretch out the roleplaying opportunity 
here is to separate the sides. The NPC may do his taunting from a 
half-hidden position: top of a tower, the other side of a moat while the
 drawbridge slowly lowers, and or something like that. One member of the
 party must "keep him talking" while the others make their own 
preparations.</p>
<p align="left">When the party finally attacks, the major NPC has a 
readied spell or action (since he's been expecting this) and he may have
 hidden assets as well, just as the party does. If the NPC has high 
ranks in Bluff or Perform (Acting), he may have completely fooled the 
heroes (invited them in to a meal while poisoning their wine). In cases 
like this, DO NOT ask for saving throws or Spot checks from the party. 
Instead, ask for Diplomacy and Sense Motive rolls. Determine the 
required DCs for these as part of the encounter prep. Asking for a Spot 
check is a big red flag to players that something is going on, and many 
"break character" and begin prepping for combat when their characters 
(who failed the Spot checks) would not do so.</p>
<p align="left">Instead, wait and drag the party further into the 
villain's clutches. Until someone says "He's playing us", let the NPC 
get away with it. That way, the sense of betrayal is much more real -- 
because you, as the DM, have fooled the players to some degree as well. 
Once the players catch on, THEN ask for the Fortitude saves for the 
poisoned wine, the Spot rolls to see the hidden archers, the Spellcraft 
check to notice the necromantic spell on the servants, and so forth.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="left">Roleplaying encounters require design and prep work to 
have maximum impact, and usually the ones that work really well are 
remembered much longer than most combats. </p>
