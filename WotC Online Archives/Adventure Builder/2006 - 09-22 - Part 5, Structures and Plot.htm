 a great DM can create an adventure on the fly out of a set of ragged 
note cards and carefully-chosen random encounters, most of us need a 
little more preparation -- and a lot more structure.</p>
<p align="left">The hook gets the adventure started (as discussed in "<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ab/20060811a">Setting the Hook</a>"),
 but the plot needs more than just a beginning; it needs a middle and an
 end as well. How can you build those and know they'll work? What are 
the best kinds of adventure plot structures?<br> Well, there are two 
standard ways to think about adventure structures: linear adventures and
 matrix plots. Likewise, there are two primary methods of advancing the 
plot: triggered encounters and site-based encounters. Both approaches 
have their strengths and weaknesses, and most adventures meld the two. 
Neither is strictly "better" than the other, but most DMs find they 
prefer one or the other.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Linear Plots</b></p>
<p align="left">The beauty of linear plots is that they work so simply, 
and any group of players, even complete novices, can succeed with it. 
The party goes through a set of encounters in sequence. These can be 
encounters sequenced in time or in space.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Chronological Linear Plots</b></p>
<p align="left">Adventures that are linear through time include things 
like sieges, rebellions, regicides, or natural disasters, where the 
events unfold in a logical progression -- but the party either helps or 
hinders that progression. The party can act only when it has information
 to act on or when circumstances around the PCs change. As the DM is the
 gatekeeper of game information, you control the pace of the game. If 
the vital ship hasn't arrived yet, or the crucial message hasn't reached
 its recipient, the adventure doesn't progress. The party can make 
preparations, or do research, or go on other adventures -- but the 
chronological adventure moves when you say it does. This can be a great 
help if you are designing, say, an adventure with the first scene played
 at 1st level, the second major scene at 4th level, and the finale at 
6th level, but it's an unusual way for most designers to work. 
Essentially, a chronological design like this is a one big set of linear
 triggered encounters (see below), and it's often more linear than it 
needs to be.</p>
<p align="left">How can you tell that a chronological design might be 
too linear? The flow chart for the design doesn't branch anywhere; the 
party just waits for you to provide the action and responds. That sounds
 worse than it is; the level of control of timing can create memorable 
action, but it's not what most players think of as a "standard D&amp;D 
adventure". </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Geographic Linear Plots</b></p>
<p align="left">Linear plots like this are usually either a road 
adventure or a dungeon. Road adventures or quest adventures are linear 
because the important encounters happen on a road, river, trade route, 
or other path. <i>The Hobbit</i> is a fine example, but <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is not because the party splits up and events happen in divergent locations that all affect the end result.</p>
<p align="left">Dungeons are often touted as the perfect linear 
adventure, especially dungeons that contain choke points such as gates, 
single staircases, or air shafts that the party must traverse to reach 
the next section. And they are linear adventures, but in some ways they 
can often be bypassed by a clever party with disguises and stealth, with
 teleportation or other movement magic, or simply by digging a tunnel 
from one section of the dungeon to another. In most cases, dungeons are 
designed to offer at least a few branching paths for players to explore,
 to avoid being boringly linear.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-22%20-%20Part%205,%20Structures%20and%20Plot_files/dx0922ab5_road.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="165" width="270">Road
 adventures are really the most satisfying approach to linear 
adventures, at least for the DM. They allow a DM to showcase his 
favorite exotic scenery, to throw nuisance encounters at the party, and 
to grant or take away polders (discussed in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ab/20060728a">Adventure Builder #1</a> and <i>Dungeon</i>
 135). You have total control over the pacing. If you need an important 
NPC to show up early, just move him one day's travel closer to the 
party. If the party is too fresh or too stealthy, you can add a weather 
encounter, bandits, or even just an annoying group of zealous pilgrims 
who want to travel along with the party. If the party wants to complete 
the adventure, they have to follow the road. It's the perfect example of
 a railroad plot, with all its strengths and weaknesses. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Trouble with Linear Plots</b></p>
<p align="left">So if linear plots are so wonderful from the DM 
perspective, why doesn't everyone use them? Well, they do, in books and 
movies, where the narrative is presented complete and whole and the 
reader or viewer just soaks it in. But players want to feel a sense of 
mastery and control: what's the point of being a big shot hero if your 
actions don't matter and your fate is already totally determined? No 
group of players wants to walk through a completely linear A-B-C 
sequence of rooms that ends with some big mastermind encounter. It's 
logical, it's a progression of suspense and tension, and it's totally 
unsatisfying. Players want to see their choices (or at least the 
illusion of choice) affect the gameplay.</p>
<p align="left">So, linear adventure designs need to manufacture the illusion of choice.</p>
<p align="left">The illusion of choice is just what it sounds like: no 
matter what decisions the players make, they wind up where you want them
 to wind up. All NPC wizards can translate the Lost Book of Golgamar. 
Some dungeon caverns are red herrings but the only way to the second 
level leads through the big boss's room. All taverns contain one of the 
cardinal's spies. All roads lead to Mount Doom. It doesn't matter what 
they choose.</p>
<p align="left">But of course, it should never look that way. To the 
party, choices should matter, and if you hint otherwise, players have 
every right to be annoyed and frustrated with your game. If you give 
them nothing but tactical combat choices to make, you might as well be 
playing a miniatures wargame. They need to have at least some control.</p>
<p align="left">Even if choice is an illusion in your design, it 
shouldn't always be an illusion of success. Some of their false choices 
should appear to be failures. But better yet, your adventures shouldn't 
be entirely linear. They should contain branching or matrix elements as 
well.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Matrix Plots</b></p>
<p align="left">Matrix plots are looser plots that don't progress from A
 to B to C, but may jump around in any order. Three factions fight for 
dominance in Sigil, the City of Doors, and the PCs may align themselves 
with one or more of them. A plague threatens a kingdom, but the clues 
that point to the culprit can be found in any order. Matrix plots may 
move ahead over time with or without the PCs' input. They are more 
typical for mystery adventures, city adventures, and horror adventures.</p>
<p align="left">Matrix adventures depend on triggered encounters or 
site-based encounters. These correspond to the basic encounter types in 
chronological or geographic linear plots, but work a little differently.
 </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Triggered Encounters</b></p>
<p align="left">Triggered encounters happen when the trigger is pulled: 
when the stars are right, when the red lantern hangs from the attic 
window, when a horned man comes to town, when the murder weapon is 
found, or when the party goes to ask for help from the seven-eyed 
wizard. The triggers can be anything, but in a linear adventure, they 
set each other off like dominos. To meet the horned man, you need the 
stars and the lantern first. </p>
<p align="left">In a matrix adventure, the order doesn't matter -- and 
that makes design much more complex. The number of what-ifs is tougher: 
if the stars aren't aligned yet, does the horned man know when they will
 be aligned? But if the stars are already aligned, that's unneeded 
information. The number of permutations quickly grows, which is why I 
recommend that a matrix plot have just three major triggers, and that 
everything else be a standard linear element. Go for four major triggers
 if you feel ambitious, but realize that each trigger is a little like a
 separate act in a play; it should change the player's goals, or their 
understanding of the situation in some way.</p>
<p align="left">Once you know what those three elements are, you can 
design around all the major permutations. Typical triggers are clues 
(finding a map, meeting the ghost of a dead twin, or deciphering a 
runestone), time triggers (chimes at midnight, the arrival of a 
courier), and significant actions (reforging a sword, visiting an 
oracle). For each of those triggers, I like to have a separate finale 
scene in mind (see below), but that's probably not necessary. Just make 
sure that the villain or final battle can take place at any of the 
trigger locations.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Site-Based Encounters</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-22%20-%20Part%205,%20Structures%20and%20Plot_files/dx0922ab5_dungeon.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="203" width="216">If
 you want to, you can think of site-based encounters as plot elements 
are triggered by location, but that underestimates their importance in 
game design. Location is EVERYTHING in dungeon adventures, because the 
map constrains the sequence that players can approach things. To reach 
the big bad evil guy's ultimate lair, the party must walk the road. This
 is why site-based encounters and linear plots so often go hand-in-hand:
 location determines the order of scenes, the progression of the plot, 
the unraveling of clues. But sites can also be a useful way of 
organizing your matrix plot; the party often visits places on the map 
until they run out of ideas. Having a map is a way of keeping the party 
looking around, even if the ultimate encounter isn't even on the jungle 
map at all, but hidden deep in a cenote, a sinkhole and sacrificial well
 deep below the jungle floor.</p>
<p align="left">Simply by making the map of sites go through certain 
choke points, your design guarantees that the party does what you want 
--- but in matrix adventures, the locations are each a small part of a 
larger mosaic. In a perfect matrix design, there's enough little bits of
 the larger picture scattered around that, for instance, after getting 
any 5 out of the 8 major encounters, a group of players will have enough
 information to see the finale coming.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Finales</b></p>
<p align="left">The three most important scenes in any adventure are the
 inciting incident (which gamers call the hook), reversals, and finale. 
The reversal is usually the point at which a trigger changes the party 
goals, and the finale is simply that moment when the party finally, 
finally gets to take down the Big Bad. Structuring a finale, though, is 
tricky. </p>
<p align="left">D&amp;D design at Wizards of the Coast usually assumes 
that the final encounter has an EL of at least the average party level 
plus 2, and often as much as average party level plus 4. The trick to 
balancing this crucial combat, though, is that it's hard to know just 
how beat up the party will be at the start of it. Overdo it, and it's a 
total party kill. Make it too easy, and the party walks all over the 
encounter that should challenge them the most.</p>
<p align="left">This is why minions, summoned monsters, and henchman can
 be so valuable to designing a finale: they're a catchup factor that 
lets you dial in the difficulty. If the party is very hurt, they may 
just fight some of the villain's underlings and retreat, and the finale 
itself is saved for a second fight (if the party can find the villain 
again). If the DM is generous, a party that kills the villain 
demoralizes all the henchmen, and the fight is effectively over -- the 
minions flee.</p>
<p align="left">If the party is very strong at the end of the adventure,
 the minions and other secondary creatures keep coming, keep fighting, 
and bring in more and more reinforcements -- until at last the party 
takes down their major opponent, and the night ends as a big success. As
 a designer, you should consider designing the final encounter with a 
variable number of underlings to make it as tough as it can be, without 
going over.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Know what kind of design you want at the start, and 
build to suit: a straight line, a matrix, or a little of each. Either 
way, the plot should point to a single finale that can be modified on 
the fly for maximum entertainment at the Big Finish.</p>
