<p align="LEFT"><i>"You meet a guy in a bar and he tells you about a dungeon outside town." </i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"During the midnight watch, someone shoots an arrow into your camp. There's a note attached, written in Elvish."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">One is old news, and won't get much of a welcome from 
players. The other likely will have them asking questions and being 
drawn into *whatever* follows that arrow: a threat? an offer of parley? 
an alliance? Regardless, it immediately launches the action and the 
adventure.<br> The adventure hook is what kicks off the action, and what
 brings the players into the game. In fiction, it would be called the 
"inciting incident." Without a strong hook, your adventure becomes a 
matter of players going through the motions dutifully because "that's 
where the adventure is this week." With a strong hook, the PCs will be 
curious and will start planning their actions, aggressively moving the 
game forward for you. A weak hook means that you'll have to push the 
action forward with big "Adventure Here" signs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Pick a Motive </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> There is no one perfect hook, just as there is no 
perfect lure in fishing. Different fish respond to different flies, 
jigs, and worms; different groups and even each different player 
responds best to different rewards and motives. Playing with a group 
will give you an idea of whether a particular player or character is 
likely to respond to the pleading penniless merchant, the scholar with a
 mystery, or the rich landowner offering rich land.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The six most common motives are listed here, with a typical NPC comment and sample hooks. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>1) Curiosity:</b> "No one knows what's down there. 
It's never been explored." This hook works very well for certain players
 who love the unknown. Lost cities, ancient tombs, hidden mountain 
valleys, deadly fey forests, maps to Atlantis, all fall into this 
category. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>2)</b><b>Fear/Survival:</b> "If you don't stop the 
raiders at the oasis, we'll all die!" The beauty of this hook is its 
immediacy. There's a threat, and the heroes have a chance to shine. It 
doesn't work if it's overplayed, such as telling low-level PCs to fight a
 demon lord or the like. Typical examples include raiding giants, a 
swarm of formians or other insects, aboleth or drow slavers, or the 
clichéd invasion from another plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>3) Greed: </b>This is the classic hook for simple 
adventures. "Loot that tomb, and you'll buy able to buy all the magic 
and supplies you'll ever want!" This hook usually works, but it's a lazy
 way to start an adventure for most designers. To make it more 
memorable, at least try to make the treasure under discussion more 
interesting than gold. This motive also includes wages ("I'll pay you to
 do this job for me"), although wages are probably the worst of motives 
for real heroes. Money is useful, but boring. Real heroes just want it 
to fund their next set of heroics. Typical examples of this hook include
 a mysterious guide to the city of gold, a long-lost dragon hoard, an 
unopened tomb of mage-kings, or looting rich princes of the Church. You 
might also consider an emperor's patronage, a gift from a magic 
ringmaker's workshop, or even the tried-and-true promise of pirate gold.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>4) Heroism:</b> Some people want to be noticed and 
admired; others just want to do the right thing. For heroes, it's 
usually about being remembered for their deeds. "Bards will sing of your
 glory if you just hold the pass for a day." This sort of hook works 
best for parties that care about what their peers think of them, but it 
doesn't really work for rogues and tricksters. Typical examples include 
saving the weak from slavers, holding a fort, bridge or pass against a 
mob, tournaments of skill, and single combats to the death. This hook 
type is amazing for certain characters who are looking for a blaze of 
glory -- you should make sure that a spectacularly good death against 
swarms of unrelenting evil is available for those who seek it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>5) Loyalty, honor and duty:</b> "The dwarven 
ancestors smile on those who escort the caravan through the mines." 
Sometimes, a race, class, or prestige class comes with some underlying 
assumptions about a code of conduct. You can exploit this to ask a monk 
to undertake a mission for his sensei, a paladin for his church, or a 
dwarf for his clan and chieftain. Players can, of course, refuse such 
quests, but they usually don't, especially if the mission is one their 
character naturally gravitates toward. The loyal PC pulls everyone else 
along in their wake. Typical examples include carrying sacred scrolls to
 a new temple, a pilgrimage, lifting the siege of a clan holding, 
restoring a bride's honor, or proving the innocence of a relative.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>6) Revenge:</b> "They killed your brother and stole 
your father's sword!" This is best used in a long-running campaign with a
 recurring villain, and can be neatly connected to existing plot 
threads. It's even more effective if the crime that calls out for 
revenge happened when the affected characters were on watch, or in 
charge. Typical examples include vendettas and revenge killings, 
kidnappings, capturing a criminal, stealing back the stolen goods or 
idols, horse or pegasus rustling, and arson.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Make It Personal</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The best hooks tie in to the existing characters, such 
as hinting at a holy sword for a paladin, at an ancient lost invocation 
for a warlock, or at a chance to shine in the eyes of a high priest and 
congregation for a cleric. If any players have a character background 
that describes their friends, mentors, or family, you can use that 
background to make a hook more powerful -- by threatening the 
character's nearest and dearest. Be ruthless, too -- if the party 
doesn't act, the threatened danger happens.<br> The hook needs to offer 
something to the players who are most likely to seize the day and go for
 it. If your party leader is playing a halfling thief, greed is the 
right path. If the party leader is a paladin, noble quests and heroism. 
If you don't know what type of adventure the players want most, ask. 
They'll be happy to tell you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can also combine hooks, to suit more than one 
player's strongest motives. If a paladin and a greedy halfing are the 
party leaders, you might try "You must destroy the evil temple to lay 
the spirits to rest -- and their treasury is rumored to be very rich 
indeed."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Make It Concrete and Tough to Refuse</b></p>

That's where our <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/sh">Steal This Hook</a> series comes into play, offering adventure hooks for <b>Forgotten Realms</b>, <b>Eberron</b>, even <b>d20 Modern</b> settings.</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">You want your hooks to be specific, and you want them to
 be very hard to turn down. Vague, overused, or clichéd hooks don't 
interest players because they have heard them before. Some overused 
hooks that lack compelling detail include:Kidnapped princesses and 
children</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting a stranger in a tavern</li>
<li>Requests from the mayor or head villager</li>
<li>Evil insane wizards</li>
<li>Sudden invasions of squicky evil things: undead, demons, whatever</li>
<li>Finding the map to a dungeon </li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The hooks that work best are often those that don't 
REQUIRE the party to respond. Instead, they play to the character's 
status, power, or skill -- they involve some flattery. Some NPC thinks 
the heroes, no matter how low their experience level, are worthy of 
respect, people that will step up in a pinch: in a word, heroes. Their 
requests or pitch make it clear that they think the PCs are competent 
and valuable allies. For example:A merchant asks a big favor from an old
 family friend</p>
<ul>
<li>A dwarf, elf, half-orc, or barbarian tribe or clan asks whether the 
PC can escort a clan troublemaker into exile. Nobody says no to family.</li>
<li>A gnome claims he has a few coins from a long-lost dragon hoard</li>
<li>A secret message is smuggled to the party from an innocent prisoner</li>
<li>A scholar asks for advice, or help collecting "just a few botanical samples" from his wizard, druid, or bard friend.</li>
<li>A paladin asks the party's warriors to help judge a tournament (where a coup is planned)</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> What the second set of hooks has in common is a 
concrete task or a mystery that encourages further exploration, without 
falling back on fantasy staples that are worn pretty thin. People 
respond well to requests for help, to greed, to a chance to win praise 
or notice, and to the new and unusual. They respond badly to demands, to
 repetition, and to random desperation. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stacking Hooks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The first hook isn't necessarily the last hook. In 
fact, the first hook may be nothing but a way to get the action started.
 Once the adventure is underway, the PCs may soon learn that what they 
thought was a bit of tomb-looting can become a matter of survival 
because they have unleashed a new danger. The effort to escort a dwarven
 caravan from mines to foundries out of loyalty may become a revenge 
adventure once it's clear that the foundry has been raided and the clan 
chieftain killed by giants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Why do I call these hooks rather than plot twists? 
Because the second hook is available for those times when the party 
decides to ignore the first one. If they say "Oh, I'll send my henchman 
on escort duty", that henchman can return from the mission with the news
 of the dead clan chieftain -- which then becomes the new hook. If that 
doesn't get the dwarven hero involved, nothing will.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hooks That Fail</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Some hooks just don't attract any interest from the 
players. They ignore the guy in the bar. They don't want to help a group
 of elves because their new member is a dwarf. They decide to follow up 
some other clue from a prior adventure, or they're just not drawn in by 
the shiny bauble you present to them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Don't try to force it. Let it go.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Players know when you are pushing them in a certain 
direction. If the hook's really no good, they resent being pushed into 
it. If the hook you dreamed up doesn't work, it's better in the long run
 to let the party ignore it. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But what about the game? If you really want the PCs to 
choose the adventure you planned, then you need a better hook for it. 
Make one up and keep the play moving. On the other hand, if you feel 
comfortable winging it, run a different adventure using existing 
villains or a simple mission such as travel from point A to point B. The
 players may find a clue or treasure along the way that leads them back 
to the main adventure --- possibly without knowing that they're just 
taking a longer route to it. Or you may find that the hook you make up 
on the spot intrigues you too -- and that's what you prepare for the 
next week's session.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Be a Ham</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Part of a successful hook is just in how you present 
it. Be a ham; get in touch with your inner circus ringmaster. Don't read
 a dry lump of text in your everyday tone; try a deeper voice or mimic a
 gruff dwarven accent, gesture a little around the table, throw down a 
handful of golden chocolate coins from the candy aisle. Players will 
respond to your enthusiasm with their own.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Most adventures have several hooks written into them to
 begin with. Knowing which one will work for any given audience helps 
you ensure that the action starts off strong and that the players keep 
the action rolling.</p>
