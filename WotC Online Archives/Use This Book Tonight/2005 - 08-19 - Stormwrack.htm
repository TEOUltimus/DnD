 get to a body of water is when the clumsy dwarf spills his ale. But 
this need not be the case -- plenty of opportunities for adventure exist
 on (or under) the blue waves of the ocean or the sunless seas of the 
Underdark. If you've ever longed for high seas action, or even if you're
 just interested in putting your PCs into a foreign environment to test 
their mettle, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/178670000">Stormwrack</a>: Mastering the Perils of Wind and Wave</i> may just be what you seek. </p>
<p align="left">That said, it might be tough to incorporate a seagoing 
adventure into tonight's gaming session. That's why this column presents
 two options. The first assumes that your upcoming game is a fairly 
typical dungeon delve, so you can insert a flooded tunnel into the 
adventure. The second option, however, is perfect for campaigns at a 
point where hopping on a ship is a reasonable next step for the 
characters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Watery Corridor</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2008-19%20-%20Stormwrack_files/dx20050819a_90764.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="239" width="260">Somewhere
 beneath the surface, the PCs come across a flooded section of dungeon 
tunnel, created by rainwater dripping through from above or maybe an 
underground river seeping through the wall. Hiding in the murky waters 
is a potentially deadly threat. Depending on the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_level')">level</a>
 of your party, this threat might be one, two, or four leech swarms (EL 
2, 3, or 5) or a hungry uchuulon (also known as a slime chuul; EL 7). 
For tougher parties, add a spectre (or two) living in truce with the 
chuul so that they can share food that swims past -- the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_incorporeal')">incorporeal</a> spectre can ignore the combat penalties for fighting underwater.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Read This:</b> Go over the monster description for the creature you choose -- leech swarm (page 162, plus the swarm traits on page 316 in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">Monster Manual</a></i>) or uchuulon (page 163).</p>
<p align="left"> Also, review the rules on fighting underwater (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">Dungeon Master's Guide</a></i> pages 92-93 and the sidebar on page 21 in <i>Stormwrack</i>), the Swim skill description (<i>Player's Handbook</i> page 84; note that the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/175240000">Player's Handbook</a></i>
 is considered the "primary source" for rules on holding your breath and
 thus take precedence over differing information found elsewhere). The 
rules for visibility in murky water appear on page 11 and are reproduced
 in a sidebar below.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2008-19%20-%20Stormwrack_files/dx20050819a_90766.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="324" width="248">If you're using the leech swarm, take note of the PCs' Spot checks and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Constitution')">Constitution</a>
 scores before starting play. That's because damage dealt by undetected 
leeches isn't conveyed to the player until the character actually 
notices the attack -- a PC might be rendered unconscious without 
realizing he's being <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydrain')">drained</a> of Constitution!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Say This:</b> (At the start of the encounter) "A 
staircase ahead of you leads down into murky water. Only a few inches of
 space are between the surface of the water and the low ceiling of the 
tunnel."</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's the Big Deal:</b> This encounter forces the PCs to fight on the monsters' turf. Unless the PCs have easy access to water breathing and either <i>freedom of movement</i> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_swim')">swim</a> speeds, this encounter will likely be significantly more difficult than normal. You should probably increase the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_experiencepoint')">XP</a> reward by 50%; the Encounter Levels listed above are increased by +1 to reflect this difficulty.</p>
<p align="left">The tunnel is 10 feet high, with all but the top 6 
inches filled with water. It can be as long as your dungeon allows, but 
somewhere between 30 feet and 60 feet is best. At the start of the 
encounter, the monsters occupy the area at the far end of the flooded 
tunnel and remain underwater (and thus are likely invisible, 
particularly considering their good Hide <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_modifier')">modifiers</a>). They </p>

<p align="left"><b>Murky Water</b></p>
<p align="left">Murky water reduces the radius of illumination provided 
by a light source (the sun or a carried light source, such as an object 
with a <i>light</i><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>
 cast on it) by 50%, since light scatters and reflects from matter 
hanging in the water. For example, a sunrod normally provides bright 
illumination to a range of 30 feet and shadowy illumination to 60 feet, 
but in murky water these are reduced to 15 feet and 30 feet, 
respectively.</p>
<p align="left">Very murky or muddy water obscures all sight, including <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_darkvision')">darkvision</a>, beyond 5 feet.

<p align="left">move forward to attack any PC who comes within 20 feet.</p>
<p align="left">The sediment in the water makes it murky, reducing light's ability to illuminate it (see sidebar). As soon as any creature of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a>
 or larger size starts moving through the water, all squares such 
creatures occupy or are adjacent to become very murky (since they stir 
up additional sediment from the bottom), making it impossible to see 
anything more than 5 feet away.</p>
<p align="left">Unless a PC has a Swim speed, she's best off fighting 
while standing on the bottom. Of course, she'll have to hold her breath 
to do that, which means she likely has only 6 or 8 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">rounds</a> of combat before Con checks are needed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aftermath:</b> This encounter isn't likely to have a 
significant impact on your storyline (unless the PCs are extremely 
unlucky, that is). It's more about introducing the players to some of 
the basic rules for operating in water.</p>
<p align="left">However, the very presence of the water-filled tunnel 
(and its inhabitant) may suggest some larger plot element. Why is the 
dungeon filling with water? If a subterranean river or sea has broken 
through a wall, it might lead to additional invaders, such as kuo-toas, 
skum (scouting for their aboleth master), or a water naga. Are other 
areas threatened by the flooding? If so, the characters might return for
 another foray to find the landscape has changed significantly.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weigh Anchor!</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2008-19%20-%20Stormwrack_files/dx20050819a_90760.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="238" width="242">Your
 campaign may be at a point where a shipboard voyage (long or short) is 
appropriate for the storyline. Maybe the characters need to cross a 
great lake to speak with a wizened sage living on the far shore, or trek
 downriver to investigate reports of river pirates, or even board a 
seagoing vessel to travel to another continent. In that case, the 
encounter below should fit reasonably well in your session. Depending on
 the voyage (and the vessel), you may need to adjust some details, but 
the basic elements are generic enough that the encounter should work 
without too much change.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Read This:</b> Familiarize yourself with the monster 
description for the seawolf (pages 158-159). Though similar to a 
lycanthrope, this sly creature is not the result of a template, but is 
instead a specific magical beast. If you have augmented the encounter 
with additional creatures (see below), review their descriptions as 
well.</p>
<p align="left">Choose a vessel appropriate for the journey and peruse 
the map and basic information regarding the ship. Chapter 5: Ships and 
Equipment in <i>Stormwrack</i> has several sample ship maps to choose 
from, including a keelboat (good for river or lake trips), a cog (a 
basic sailing ship), and a caravel (a large ship designed for travel on 
the open sea). If you use a battlemat, it's best to draw the ship out 
before starting the session to save time.</p>
<p align="left">Read the information on pages 19-21 regarding the unique
 marine terrain known as "Ship's Deck" to handle situations that may 
come up during the encounter. It's worthwhile to review the Swim skill (<i>Player's Handbook</i> page 84), just in case someone falls overboard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Say This:</b> (At the start of the encounter) "A 
light rain has been falling all afternoon, but as the sun sets on the 
first day of your voyage, a strong wind has kicked up, creating 
whitecaps on the water's surface. Your vessel rolls noticeably as the 
weather grows worse, which may indicate an uncomfortable night to come."</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's the Big Deal:</b> One or more seawolves have 
targeted the ship the PCs are aboard for an attack. One has infiltrated 
the crew of the vessel, while any others come aboard just after sundown a
 day away from port, relying on the poor weather to help conceal their 
approach. (They can see perfectly well in darkness or low light.) The 
seawolf among the crew is armed as described in the monster entry, while
 any others are unarmed and fight in hybrid form.</p>
<p align="left">The total number of seawolves attacking depend on your 
party's level. Unless you plan on running additional encounters during 
this day, you should set the total EL to about 1 to 3 higher than the 
party's level. A single seawolf (EL 3) is appropriate for characters of 
level 1 or 2, while a pair (EL 5) is good for 3rd- or 4th-level PCs. For
 higher-level groups, increase the number of seawolves appropriately. If
 your party is higher than 8th level, consider augmenting the pack of 
seawolves with a single creature of CR 7 or higher, such as an 
amphibious medusa (see page 135 in <i>Stormwrack</i>) or a dragon turtle, working in conjunction with the seawolves.</p>
<p align="left">Remember that fighting aboard a ship isn't the same as 
fighting in a house or dungeon, and it shouldn't feel that way. The deck
 is wet (from the rain), making it slippery; for added fun throw in a 
heavy roll or two during the encounter, or maybe even some green water, 
thanks to the rough weather that's blown in. Don't overdo it -- the goal
 isn't to make your players hate water travel, just to introduce them to
 some different tactical elements.</p>
<p align="left">Before the encounter begins, place the characters' 
figures in locations appropriate for early evening, either out on deck 
or safely inside away from the weather. You can either ask the players 
what gear their characters are carrying aboard the ship (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fighter')">fighters</a> may not want to be wearing heavy armor out on the ocean), or you can just assume that they're always prepared for the worst.</p>
<p align="left">Start the encounter as appropriate for the characters' 
positions. Assuming that the encounter includes more than one seawolf, 
those out on deck with darkvision or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lowlightvision')">low-light vision</a>
 are allowed DC 18 Spot checks to notice the seawolves approaching from 
about 30 feet away (modified for distance); if they succeed, roll <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> immediately. Otherwise, the seawolf aboard the vessel strikes first, attacking the captain (Exp 3; <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hp</a>
 11) with surprise just before his fellows climb aboard. The cries of 
the captain and crew (1st-level experts and warriors; quantity depends 
on the ship) alert any PCs aboard, allowing them to join the fight 
immediately.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aftermath:</b> After the assault, some questions may 
be posed. What kind of creature did the PCs face? Though clearly no 
werewolf, similarities to that lycanthrope are obvious; a DC 14 
Knowledge (arcana) check can identify the seawolf and provide basic 
information regarding the creature. Are any more of them among the crew,
 or lurking in the waters for another attempt? Do these creatures have a
 lair nearby? If so, what riches might they have plundered from other 
vessels traveling through the area? If the PCs aren't in command of the 
vessel, a side trip may not be an option, but a return to the region 
might well be in order for another day. A possible worst-case scenario: 
If the crew took serious casualties, the PCs might even find themselves 
in the awkward position of having to get the vessel safely to shore!</p>
