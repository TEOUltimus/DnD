</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><i>Red Hand of Doom</i> is designed for characters that 
start around 5th or 6th level. Those of us in RPG R&amp;D believe 5th 
level to be the best starting point for PCs in this adventure; not only 
does this make the first section of the adventure more challenging, but 
the PCs have a chance for greater customization if they hit 6th level 
after they've discovered the plot and gain an understanding of the 
adventure's style and scope. This way, their 6th level feat choice can 
be tailor-made for the adventure.</p>
<p align="left">This article presents an encounter that you can drop into your campaign that provides a tangible hook to get PCs moving toward <i>Red Hand of Doom's </i>location.
 While I ran this encounter as a direct lead-in to the adventure, it 
could also fit just as easily as a short side-trek in the middle of an 
ongoing adventure. I'd suggest running the encounter when the PCs are 
4th level, and toward the end of 4th level/beginning of 5th level if you
 plan to move directly into <i>Red Hand of Doom</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What You Need to Read</b></p>
<p align="left">Take a quick look at the following before running this encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li> The adventure background section on pg. 4 of <i>Red Hand of Doom</i>.<br><br></li>
<li>The encounter below uses hobgoblin regulars and a hobgoblin veteran;
 stat blocks for both are on pages 119 and 120, respectively. You'll 
want to familiarize yourself with those stats, since they comprise half 
of the encounter. Our <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060217a">web enhancement</a> also collates these creature stats.<br><br></li>
<li>You'll need a <i>Monster Manual</i> handy to reference stats for the ogre (pg. 199).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>The Encounter</b></p>
<p align="left">The half-dragon hobgoblin warrior Azarr Kul is raising a
 massive army of dragons, goblinoids, and any other monsters that will 
follow his banner. To this end, he's sent hobgoblin emissaries 
throughout the region to enlist the aid of all manner of creatures. One 
such group of hobgoblins is halfway through its mission; they're 
currently in the process of recruiting an ogre that's taken up residence
 in a hillside cave at the fringes of populated land (near where the PCs
 are adventuring), living off of pigs and sheep stolen from nearby 
farmsteads.</p>
<p align="left">The PCs might inadvertently stumble upon the ogre's lair
 as they travel through the wilderness, or they could be investigating 
missing livestock on behalf of the local farmers.</p>
<p align="left">The ogre's cave is a simple affair, a roughly square 
cave about forty feet across. It is littered with mostly-eaten pigs and 
other animals, and a pile of not entirely cured animal hides provides a 
rudimentary bed, with a fresh sheepskin apparently being used as a 
pillow.</p>
<p align="left">The group of hobgoblin emissaries consists of three 
hobgoblin regulars and a single hobgoblin veteran. By the time the PCs 
arrive, the hobgoblins have already presented their offer to the ogre, 
along with a small pouch filled with gold and the promise of more to 
come in Azarr Kul's service. The ogre is within the cave, contemplating 
the offer... since he's none too bright, it takes him a while to mull 
over his options. The hobgoblins consider themselves professional 
soldiers, and maintain a vigilant watch as they wait for the ogre to 
emerge with his answer (after all, in their minds the ogre is just as 
likely to attack them as join them).</p>
<p align="left">The terrain around the cave can be whatever is 
appropriate to your campaign, but should include some amount of blocking
 terrain, such as forests, large boulders, and so on, to allow your 
party members a chance to sneak up on the hobgoblins if they are so 
inclined. The hobgoblins all have Spot and Listen modifiers of +3 (+4 
Spot for the veteran). If they see the PCs, they attack quickly and 
efficiently.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Roll Initiative!</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2006%20-%2002-24%20-%20Red%20Hand%20of%20Doom_files/dx0224ub_utbt_ogre.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="259" width="240"></b>The
 ogre waits five rounds before emerging from the cave once battle begins
 (since he's lost in thought, after all). The hobgoblins, however, waste
 no time in moving to attack. They attempt to attack in pairs, denying 
opponents a flank if possible, while setting themselves up to take a 
5-foot step to flank the PCs. If the PCs use ranged attacks, the 
hobgoblins answer in kind, taking cover while using their composite 
longbows. At range, they target spellcasters first, and also try to 
concentrate their efforts on any PC that exhibits healing magic. Once 
the ogre emerges, it charges the nearest PC, only changing targets if 
another deals more damage than its current target.</p>
<p align="left">The hobgoblin regulars, eager to impress their leader, 
fight to the death unless the hobgoblin veteran falls, in which case 
they attempt to flee. When first reduced to half hit points, the veteran
 will attempt to step back and quaff a healing potion, so long as he can
 do so without provoking attacks of opportunity. The veteran fights to 
the death, however, proclaiming the Red Hand's victory even with his 
final breath. The ogre will fall back into the cover of its cave if 
assaulted from range, answering arrows or spells with javelins, but will
 fight to defend his home. If the PCs flee, the ogre will only chase 
them for a round or two before heading back to his cave to count his 
coins.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="left">The hobgoblin veteran, in addition to his normal 
possessions, carries two small black leather pouches each marked with a 
bright red hand. Inside each pouch are exactly 75 gp, and a note written
 in goblin which states "Bring glory to the Red Hand. Come to where the 
Wyrmsmokes and Witchwood join, and we will destroy the humans and build 
an empire!"</p>
<p align="left">A similar pouch is within the ogre's cave, though the 
note is crumpled and tossed aside, since the ogre isn't much for 
reading. In addition to the pouch and note, the ogre had managed a small
 collection of gemstones, with a bloodstone, an amethyst, a golden 
yellow topaz, and a handful of malachite stones all scattered about his 
bedding (total value of all gems: 600 gp).</p>
<p align="left">From the presence of the pouches and notes on the 
hobgoblin and in the cave, the PCs should be able to deduce the 
hobgoblins' reason for being near the ogre's lair.</p>
<p align="left">Once they translate the notes, any character that makes a
 DC 15 Knowledge (geography) check will recognize the Wyrmsmokes as a 
mountain range and the Witchwood as a forest near Elsir Vale. A DC 20 
Knowledge (geography) check indicates that Drellin's Ferry is the 
closest settlement to where the mountains and forest meet.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs take evidence of the ogre back to the local 
farmers, they pay the party 50 gp, and one of the farmers gives the PCs a
 family heirloom masterwork weapon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Scaling the Encounter</b></p>
<p align="left">If your PCs are already 5th or 6th level, but you'd still like to throw in this encounter to get them hooked into the <i>Red Hand of Doom</i>
 plot, you could upgrade the hobgoblins to three veterans led by a 
hobgoblin sergeant. In this case, place one of the veterans within the 
cave with the ogre. This will approximate an EL 6 encounter and an EL 5 
encounter, run back-to-back.</p>
