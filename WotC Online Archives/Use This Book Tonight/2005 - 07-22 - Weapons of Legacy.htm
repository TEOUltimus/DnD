 vanquishing the dragon, the heroes discover its treasure hoard. 
Underneath a pile of gold and silver lies a finely crafted greatsword, 
its hilt wrapped in crimson leather. Thanks to your carefully prepared 
notes, you know the sword's long history, from its creation by dwarves 
in the volcanic depths of a distant mountain range to its role in the 
defense of the kingdom against the last flight of dragons to rampage 
across the land. A cornerstone of your world's timeline, the sword has 
waited decades for worthy hands to wield it once again -- worthy hands 
like those of the paladin who struck the death-blow against the dragon.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"It's a </i>+1 dragonbane greatsword<i>," says the wizard after studying it for a few minutes.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"That would've been useful a few minutes ago!" complains the paladin. "Oh, well, at least we can sell it for 4,000 gp."</i></p>
<p align="left">Has this scene happened to you? If so, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/178620000">Weapons of Legacy</a></i>
 may be exactly what the doctor ordered. Between the covers of this book
 you'll find nearly 50 unique magic items, each with a history and set 
of magic powers all its own. But even better, the book contains rules 
that allow each one of these unique items to grow more powerful along 
with its wielder. No more will the fighter's one-of-a-kind weapon end up
 sold to a local merchant; instead, the character and the weapon become 
intertwined, and the legends of your world can live on in the hands of 
your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a>.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to a detailed history, each item featured in <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>
 includes a sample encounter for introducing the weapon into your game. 
These encounters can be used either as the goal of a quest -- for 
characters following rumors and stories of one of the fabled legacy 
weapons -- or as part of an otherwise normal adventure. A character may 
even come across a legacy weapon without realizing what he has found, 
though that realization shouldn't be long in coming.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Read This </b></p>
<p align="left">The entry for <i>Crimson Ruination</i> (pages 61-63) is 
crucial, though most of the sword's powers won't come into play during 
this session. Still, you should be comfortable with the weapon's array 
of abilities before introducing it to your campaign.</p>
<p align="left">Consider skimming the first few pages of Chapter One: 
The Legacy for more background on legacy items, including What Is a 
Weapon of Legacy? (pages 5-6, or read it here in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/iw/20050602a">June's Previews</a>) and Designing Legacy Adventures (pages 7-9).</p>
<p align="left">Review the statistics for a very young red dragon (<i>Monster Manual,</i> page 75). If you choose to make the dragon more powerful, either create a new set of statistics or consult <i>Draconomicon</i> for a full writeup of a red dragon of your choice of age category.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Crimson Ruination</b></i></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2007-22%20-%20Weapons%20of%20Legacy_files/dx20050722a_90262.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="431" width="124">This
 fabled greatsword was first wielded by Sir Endrik van Ibnacht, a 
legendary dragonslayer who lived centuries ago. A gift from the dwarves,
 <i>Crimson Ruination</i> is said to have been crafted from the bones, 
skin, and blood of a red wyrm slain by Sir Endrik himself. It makes a 
good legacy weapon for your campaign because the prerequisites to 
properly wield it are easily met (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack bonus</a> +3, any nonchaotic <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_')">alignment</a>) and because the details of its history should fit well into any traditional <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign. (If none of your PCs are likely to want a magic greatsword, feel free to change <i>Crimson Ruination</i>
 to a bastard sword or a longsword. You can even change it more 
drastically, though in this case the illustration is no longer useful 
for depicting the weapon to the PCs.)</p>
<p align="left">The sample encounter provided in the weapon's entry doesn't require that the PCs be hunting for <i>Crimson Ruination</i>
 (or even for a dragon's lair). If your characters are already in an 
area where the cave can be placed without difficulty, you can have them 
come across the dragon's grave as part of their normal explorations. </p>
<p align="left">If, however, you want to place the weapon and/or the 
lair in more context, consider using any or all of the adventure hooks 
provided below.</p>
<ul>
<li> A dwarf known to the PCs (or perhaps the dwarf <i>is</i> one of the
 PCs) is a distant descendant of the thane Croi Machroi. In his youth, 
the dwarf learned of the thane's friendship with a human dragonslayer 
named Sir Endrik and the priceless gift given to the human by the 
dwarves in thanks for his defeat of a red wyrm plaguing their lands: a 
one-of-a-kind greatsword named <i>Crimson Ruination</i>. Sadly, the weapon was lost or stolen not long after Sir Endrik's death, and its current whereabouts are a mystery.<br><br></li>
<li>A would-be dragonslayer of some repute claimed that the blade he 
wielded was an ancient weapon of great power. Unfortunately, no one has 
seen the dragonslayer in many months. Characters who dig around for 
rumors can learn that he was last seen setting out to find the lair of a
 powerful red dragon in the mountains.<br><br></li>
<li>Heroes looking for a challenge (or a treasure horde) come across a 
map that purports to lead to a red dragon's lair high in a forbidding 
mountain range. (Though the dragon described in the map has already been
 slain and its hoard largely looted, the previous looters overlooked one
 valuable item.) </li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="2005%20-%2007-22%20-%20Weapons%20of%20Legacy_files/dx20050722a_10_DragonsGrave.jpg" border="0" height="321" width="500"></p>
<p align="left">As with the other encounters in <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>,
 the Dragon's Grave is most appropriate for low-level characters. If 
your party is higher than 4th level or so, consider increasing the age 
of the dragon to make it a memorable encounter for the PCs. (Perhaps it 
has been decades since the previous occupant was slain, or maybe it had a
 mate that was away from the cavern when it was killed.) Ideally, its CR
 should be 1 or 2 points higher than the party's level.</p>
<p align="left">Alternatively, you can add additional and/or more 
difficult threats in and around the cavern to make this adventure more 
challenging. Perhaps scavengers have descended upon the carcass; a pair 
of carrion crawlers makes an EL 6 encounter, while a black pudding makes
 a deadly EL 7 encounter. Maybe one or more intelligent creatures (such 
as an ogre mage and a troupe of four ogres [EL 9]) have taken up 
residence in the cavern, relying on the dead dragon's reputation to keep
 pesky adventurers away. The corpse of the dragon itself might even 
still be a threat (see <i>Draconomicon</i> for rules on creating special skeletal or zombie dragons).</p>
<p align="left">Ultimately, the characters should discover the side 
chamber and the weapon lying hidden there. When this happens, describe 
the appearance of <i>Crimson Ruination</i> (see the opening paragraphs 
of the weapon's entry). Anyone gazing at the sword should catch a 
glimpse of reflected flames playing along the blade, even though no fire
 is present. If a character grasps the weapon, note how it feels warm to
 the touch despite the cool air and stone around it.</p>
<p align="left">Smart players should realize that this sword isn't an ordinary magic weapon, but if they don't, allow a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 15 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">Knowledge (history) check</a> to recognize the weapon as <i>Crimson Ruination</i>;
 give that character the information provided in the first paragraph of 
the History entry. (At your option, you can allow a DC 20 Knowledge 
[arcana] or bardic knowledge check to substitute for the Knowledge 
[history] check; this increases the odds that someone will recognize the
 blade's identity.) An <i>identify</i> spell doesn't reveal the weapon's hidden powers, but a <i>legend lore</i>
 spell might well provide useful information. Adjudicate the effects of 
other divination spells as you see fit, but remember that the most 
important issue right now is that the characters recognize they have 
something unusual on their hands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="left">Regardless of the method, you want the end result of 
this encounter to be the characters wanting to find out more about the 
blade they've discovered. A bard, loremaster, wizard, or sage might well
 point them in the right direction. Use the information presented on 
pages 8 and 9 to guide their search for information, doling out bits of 
the weapon's history as appropriate to the success of their attempts. 
Depending on the level of the PCs, they may be ready to complete one or 
more of the legacy rituals required to unlock the powers of <i>Crimson Ruination.</i>
 Each one of these can become a full-fledged adventure, providing many 
hours of excitement for your PCs. Be sure that everyone in the party 
gets a chance to shine in these adventures -- just because one character
 needs to complete the task to unlock the weapon's powers doesn't mean 
he should hog the spotlight.</p>
<p align="left">Another possible outcome is that other characters in the
 party may seek out rumors of additional legacy weapons. As a DM, you 
should welcome such inquiries. Not only are these characters providing 
you with the opportunity for plenty of adventure hooks, but they also 
allow you to enrich your players' involvement in and appreciation of 
your world's history by exploring its myths and legends.</p>
