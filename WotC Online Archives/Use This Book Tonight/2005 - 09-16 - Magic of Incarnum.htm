This time we'll be checking out <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/885797200">Magic of Incarnum</a></i>, an innovative new sourcebook that presents an entirely new system of magic for <b>D&amp;D</b>.</p>
<p align="left">The closest comparison to <i>Magic of Incarnum</i> would be the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>: Both tomes present a category of special effects outside the range of options offered by the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. But whereas psionics has a long tradition in <b>D&amp;D</b>, the mysterious substance known as incarnum has been, until now, totally unknown to <b>D&amp;D</b> players. The introduction to <i>Magic of Incarnum</i>
 describes it as "an amorphous magical substance made up of the soul 
energies of all sentient creatures -- living, dead, and, it is 
theorized, those even not yet born." Those talented in shaping incarnum 
"borrow" it from the multiverse to create potent magical effects. The 
particularly wondrous thing about incarnum, and what makes it different 
from other magical energies, is that it tends to retain some of the 
"identity" of its original source when shaped, which might include 
alignments, talents, experiences, and the like.</p>
<p align="left">Much like the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> and similar "capsystem" sourcebooks, <i>Magic of Incarnum</i> is a little like a <i>Player's Handbook</i>, <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, and <i>Monster Manual</i>
 all rolled into one. It has new character races, new classes and 
prestige classes (plus substitution levels for some familiar races and 
classes), new feats and spells, new magic items, new monsters, and 
plenty of advice to the DM looking to incorporate the new system into 
his campaign.</p>
<p align="left">But since it's unlikely that your players are ready for 
their characters to explore all the options available to them between 
these covers, this column provides you, the DM, with a means of 
introducing them to the strange magical powers of the substance known as
 incarnum.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What You Need to Read</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-16%20-%20Magic%20of%20Incarnum_files/dx20050916a%2520_zombie.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="301" width="227">Here's what you absolutely, positively have to read before running this encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li> Read the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20050907a&amp;page=6">necrocarnum zombie</a> entry (pages 186-189). You'll only need one of the stat blocks, depending on the level of your party. </li>
<li> Read the Essentia entry on page 50, which explains how the 
necrocarnum zombie can rearrange the incarnum flowing through its body 
to give it special powers.</li>
<li> Read the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_swiftaction')">swift</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_immediateaction')">immediate actions</a> sidebar on page 5 (assuming you're not already familiar with this concept).</li>
<li> The descriptions of the <i>necrocarnum circlet</i> soulmeld (pages 
78-79) and of the necrocarnate prestige class (pages 132-136) aren't 
required to run the encounter, but they provide some information 
regarding the foul power responsible for creating the necrocarnum 
zombie.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>The Encounter</b></p>
<p align="left">An evil-minded shaper of incarnum has created a foul 
creature known as a necrocarnum zombie. This undead monstrosity now 
roams unchecked in the village or town currently occupied by the PCs. 
They must end its foul existence, but 'ware to those who believe it to 
be nothing more than a shambling corpse!</p>
<p align="left">Like a normal zombie, a necrocarnum zombie is animated 
from the corpse of a living creature. However, its animating energy 
comes from incarnum, not necromantic magic, which results in some very 
significant differences. For instance, instead of being slow shuffling 
monsters, necrocarnum zombies are surprisingly quick (thanks to their 
incarnum speed special quality). They're also just as intelligent as the
 original creature, and quite cunning. Once combat is underway, the 
necrocarnum zombie can shift its focus from speed to defense, channeling
 its incarnum to bolster its AC and saving throws.</p>
<p align="left">Choose a necrocarnum zombie from among the samples 
presented in Chapter 7: Monsters. Very low-level parties can probably 
handle a worg necrocarnum zombie (CR 3) or maybe a troll necrocarnum 
zombie (CR 4). Parties of mid-level PCs can face a cloud giant 
necrocarnum zombie (CR 8). If these choices don't work, you can try a 
pair of necrocarnum zombies (but note that this either requires two 
villains or a supremely powerful necrocarnate to create, which may 
impact the aftermath of the encounter). Alternatively, you could have 
one or two evil agents accompanying the necrocarnum zombie; see the 
sample <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonplayercharacter')">NPCs</a> listed in Chapter 4 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 for some options. If you have a few extra minutes, you could even apply
 the template to a different creature, such as a hill giant (which would
 make a CR 6 necrocarnum zombie).</p>
<p align="left">The encounter can take place just about anywhere. 
Ideally, the PCs are a bit off the beaten path, such as an alleyway or 
the outskirts of town, when the necrocarnum zombie lunges out of the 
shadows at them. Depending on the circumstances, the PCs might have a 
chance to make a Spot or Listen <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">check</a> to avoid surprise. Even then, the necrocarnum zombie's high <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> modifier gives it a good chance of catching one or more characters flat-footed for its initial assault.</p>
<p align="left">Describe the creature as a "shambling corpse," but allow <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a>
 12 Spot checks to notice "black motes of light slowly swimming under 
its rotting skin" -- most likely, the PCs won't know exactly what to 
make of their enemy. Unobservant characters may well just assume it to 
be a mere zombie, but as soon as it acts, note also how quickly it moves
 and reacts. This should continue to confuse the characters' 
expectations.</p>
<p align="left">After the necrocarnum zombie has closed with the PCs, it
 uses a swift action to shift its essentia from its incarnum speed 
quality to its incarnum defense quality. This decreases its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a> to the base value listed in the stat block and simultaneously grants the zombie an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_insightbonus')">insight bonus</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">AC</a> and on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saves</a>
 equal to its essentia pool (noted in the creature's special qualities 
line). Accompany this with a visual description of the black motes of 
light shifting subtly, spreading out across the zombie's entire body.</p>
<p align="left">While the villain responsible for this zombie need not be anywhere in the immediate vicinity, he must retain <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofeffect')">line of effect</a>
 between himself and his vile creation for it to remain animate. If the 
PCs block line of effect in some way, the necrocarnum zombie immediately
 and irrevocably reverts to a lifeless corpse.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="left">When the battle ends, the PCs will probably wonder what 
exactly they just faced. A DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check can confirm 
that this was no typical undead creation. Both Knowledge (arcana) and 
Knowledge (the planes) can answer questions regarding incarnum, but 
until you've decided what place incarnum has in your world, you might 
want to avoid giving out too much information. At the very least, a DC 
15 check with either skill should reveal the following clue: "Rumors 
have persisted lately of individuals dabbling with a strange new form of
 magical energy supposedly linked to the souls of all creatures living 
and dead. Some whisper that this energy might be able to grant unlife."</p>
<p align="left">If the encounter included one or more living foes, the 
PCs can question them for further information. Though these flunkies 
don't know much, a successful Intimidate check or similar interaction 
can get them to confess that they're working for some kind of "death 
mage" who created the zombie. By asking the right questions, the 
characters can get their stoolpigeon to remember that the "death mage" 
didn't speak any magic words or strange components to create the 
creature -- she just used this weird black crown she wore to make the 
thing come to life.</p>
<p align="left">Player characters who follow up on the strange power 
responsible for their assailant might well learn more about necrocarnum,
 the twisted form of incarnum used to create such creatures. Check out 
the "Necrocarnate Lore" section on page 135, but note that the DCs 
listed assume that incarnum is a commonly known substance in the world. 
If you're not yet sure that's true in your campaign, consider increasing
 the DCs by 5 or even 10 points (which may require the PCs to get some 
assistance to find further clues). Some Gather Information checks (or 
consultation with contacts) may be in order!</p>
<p align="left">It's unlikely that the necrocarnum zombie's creator 
comes looking for her creation, though she may investigate to see how 
much damage it dealt out before being destroyed. Another of her agents 
checking out "the scene of the crime" may turn out to be a useful clue 
for the PCs to follow to discover the responsible party. Assuming your 
group heads in that direction, Igalla Pallasi, the sample necrocarnate, 
makes a fine long-term foe for low- to mid-level PCs; higher-level 
characters may need a more potent enemy.</p>
<p align="left">Before you (or your players) delve too much further into
 the mysteries of incarnum, you should make some decisions about how 
this substance fits into your world. Take some time between sessions to 
read through Chapter 8: Incarnum Campaigns. Here you'll find some 
campaign arcs designed to help you add incarnum to your campaign 
setting, whether it's a brand-new discovery or a long-forgotten secret. 
The chapter also includes some incarnum-touched locations to insert into
 your game, as well as a special organization dedicated to fighting some
 of the harmful effects that incarnum can have upon the world. As you 
read the chapter, think about how the ideas presented there might fit 
with your world's backstory. Can the presence of incarnum explain parts 
of the world or its history? Do you have any key NPCs whose powers might
 be explained by this substance? While incarnum doesn't have to be the 
answer to everything in order to have a place in the world, it'll feel 
more natural to you and your players if you can describe its effects in 
much the same way that you might talk about wizardly arts, divine 
influence, or psionic traditions.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, as your characters uncover more details 
regarding incarnum, some of them may wish to learn the secrets of 
harnessing and shaping this wondrous substance. If so, and if they can 
find someone knowledgeable on the topic, you can slowly introduce them 
to some of the options available. Many of the feats in Chapter 3: 
Character Options, as well as several spells and magic items in Chapter 
5: Magic, are appropriate for characters looking to explore the secrets 
of incarnum without multiclassing or qualifying for a prestige class. 
Think of it as "dipping a toe" into the dark blue sea of incarnum. More 
dedicated characters, of course, may find a more demanding option 
intriguing. Don't discourage a player who wants to take on the challenge
 of learning a new system of power -- after all, mastery of new concepts
 is one of the great joys of <b>D&amp;D</b>!</p>
