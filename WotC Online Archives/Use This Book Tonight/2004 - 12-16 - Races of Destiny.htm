 just come back from your friendly local gaming store (or maybe from 
your mailbox with a package from Amazon.com) with a brand-new <b>D&amp;D</b>
 book in your hot little hands, and you can't wait to spring a surprise 
on your players. Trouble is, your game's in an hour, and you don't have 
time to read through the whole book looking for good stuff before the 
players show up.</p>
<p align="left">That's where this column comes in. Every month, I'll take a look at one of the current <b>D&amp;D</b>
 releases, pointing out elements you can drop into your game with 
(virtually) no prep work. I'll supply chapter references, DM tips, 
tactics, study notes for new rules -- whatever it takes to get you ready
 for your next gaming session. In less than an hour, you'll go from 0 to
 60 in using whatever new book you've just brought home. And who knows? 
You might even impress your players with your newfound ability to 
integrate brand-new material in your campaign. (Don't worry, it'll be 
our little secret.)</p>
<p align="left">Our column kicks off with a look at <i>Races of Destiny</i>. The second entry in the series of race-themed supplements, <i>Races of Destiny</i>
 provides insight into humans and their kin, including half-elves, 
half-orcs, and the mysterious illumians. Perhaps the most exciting new 
element of the book -- and almost certainly the most unusual -- the 
illumians are the focus of this month's column.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What You Need to Read</b></p>
<p align="left">While you can probably get by with little more than 
what's presented here, consider perusing these sections as well if you 
have a few minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li> The illumian description near the beginning of Chapter 3, along 
with the luminous sigils and final utterance racial traits. Skim the 
material on power sigils, but don't worry about learning all the power 
sigils and illumian words just yet; as long as you have the gist -- and 
can properly convey the visuals to the players -- you're ready. The 
other racial traits probably won't come into play the first time you use
 the race.<br><br></li>
<li>Sample illumian spy NPC in Chapter 8 (check pages 189-190 for the 
section on sample illumian NPCs). Okay, this one's a must-read -- it's 
the stat block you'll be using in the encounter -- but it's pretty 
straightforward despite its length. See "The Encounter," below, for 
details on using the NPC.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Illumians in a Nutshell</b></p>
<p align="left">The illumians, detailed in Chapter 3 of the book, are an
 offshoot of the human race and were created by sorcerous rituals. They 
are contemplative, studious individuals, with a powerful love of 
language. In fact, their racial identity relates entirely to the power 
of the word . . . or in the illumians' case, the sigil.</p>
<p align="left">Every illumian bears a set of softly glowing runes that 
orbit his head. This gives your illumian NPC an instant visual signal 
that he isn't like anyone the characters have ever met, which makes for 
an instantly memorable encounter. While a pale, bald human might not 
merit a second glance, a pale, bald human with glowing symbols circling 
his brow certainly does!</p>
<p align="left">Among these runes are one or more <i>power sigils</i>: 
particular runes that grant the illumian certain benefits. In addition 
to each power sigil granting a +1 bonus on certain checks or on caster 
level, each combination of two power sigils grants an additional unique 
ability related to the sigils that make up the combo. One combination 
might allow the character to cast certain spells spontaneously, while 
another lets him use turn/rebuke attempts to achieve alternative effects
 (somewhat like divine feats). The illumians also have a variety of 
other language-based racial traits, but you shouldn't concern yourself 
with learning those -- they're almost certainly not going to come into 
play right away.</p>
<p align="left">Like humans, illumians are extraordinarily versatile. 
With seven different power sigils and fifteen combinations, any two 
illumians can present very different faces to your PCs. To you as the 
DM, it helps prevent illumian NPCs from becoming too predictable. Even 
two illumians with the same class and level might have different power 
sigil choices.</p>
<p align="left">Also like humans, illumians take pride in mastering 
whatever situation they find themselves in. They value mastery over 
victory and would prefer to lose to a superior foe -- as long as they 
demonstrated skill -- than triumph over a lesser opponent. (Of course, 
they're almost certain to return to defeat the superior foe at a later 
point, after further study.) They have extraordinary drive -- 
occasionally appearing to outsiders as obsession -- tempered only by 
their innate caution.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Encounter</b></p>
<p align="left">Since this will almost certainly be your PCs' first 
encounter with an illumian, you should use it to highlight some of the 
race's traits. In this case, you can show off not only their unique 
visual appearance, but also their thirst for knowledge as well as their 
keen ability to plan.</p>
<p align="left">The encounter uses the illumian spy presented in Chapter
 8. A 6th-level character, the spy makes a fine encounter all by himself
 for characters up to 7th level. Even groups as low as 3rd level will 
work for this encounter, though the outcome is more likely to result in 
the illumian's favor. With more powerful (or unusually large) groups, 
you should add more spies -- use two (EL 8) for parties of level 8 or 9,
 three (EL 9) for levels 10 or 11, or four (EL 10) for levels 12 or 13. 
The spies have a bit of an edge on the characters, so it's okay if the 
EL for the encounter is a little below the party's level. (The notes 
below assume one spy, so keep that in mind when adjusting for more!)</p>
<p align="left">The setup is that some item recently acquired (and kept)
 by the party -- a scroll, a tome, or virtually any magic item -- holds 
some secret knowledge desired by an illumian cabal (the primary social 
unit of the race, as well as their version of the guild). Perhaps a 
scroll holds a message concealed by <i>illusory script</i> or a <i>secret page</i>
 spell, or the lining of the fighter's shiny new breastplate hides a 
slip of paper, or those meaningless runes along the rogue's sword blade 
turn out not to be so meaningless after all. The beauty of this hook is 
that it doesn't require any previous planning on your part -- it's 
entirely "new" to your campaign's continuity. Of course, the players 
don't know that, but that's why you're the DM. It's even better if the 
item has been around for a while, since this makes the illumians' 
"discovery" of it all the more impressive.</p>
<p align="left">The spy makes his move the next time the characters bed 
down for the night, whether that's in town or out in the wilderness. The
 latter is preferable (from your standpoint), since you can more easily 
generate a quick map of a wooded clearing than an inn, but if you're up 
for it, a B&amp;E job on the characters' own rooms is a classic 
adventure-starter. (For an interesting inn map, please check out <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/mapofweek/3DrunkDuckInn.jpg">this particular inn</a>!)
 Preferably, the characters should be ready to embark (or continue) on 
an adventure, since this lets you drop in a single encounter without 
needing immediate follow-up. </p>
<p align="left">The spy has already observed the party at some length, thanks to <i>disguise self</i>, and he has also used <i>charm person</i>
 to ask questions about them. Thus, he is well-acquainted with the 
party's capabilities and won't be surprised by any spells or magic items
 the characters use.</p>
<p align="left">Unless the party has given the illumian good reason to 
prefer lethal tactics, the spy arms himself with a sap, which he uses in
 preference to his spiked chain (Atk or Full Atk +5 melee [1d6 
nonlethal, sap]). Whoever holds the item in question is the target. If 
indoors, the illumian slips into that character's room (he can easily 
open any lock with a DC of 20 or less, and even DC 30 is within his 
reach); if outdoors, he tries to time his assault to coincide with that 
character's watch to limit the number of other active opponents.</p>
<p align="left">In either case, the illumian approaches under the cover of <i>invisibility</i> (thanks to his scroll), and with <i>mage armor</i> active from his wand (increasing his AC to 16, touch 12, flat-footed 16). Furthermore, he casts <i>disguise self</i>
 to appear as some other NPC the characters have met recently -- a 
bartender, blacksmith, sage, or other familiar face. To aid his stealth,
 the spy has doused his luminous sigils (which reduces all his Int- and 
Dex-based skill check modifiers by 2). The character must succeed at a 
DC 23 Listen check (including a -10 penalty if asleep) to hear the 
approaching spy. </p>
<p align="left">Assuming the character isn't alerted by the approach, 
allow another check to hear the spy rustling through the character's 
possessions for the desired item, and another as the spy slinks back 
away. The illumian would prefer to take the item without a fight, but he
 doesn't hesitate to deliver a sneak attack the moment that any PC 
displays any sign that she has heard the spy. As he does so, he also 
expends a 1st-level spell slot to increase his bonus sneak attack damage
 to +4d6 (thanks to his <i>vauluur</i> illumian word, the combination of his two power sigils).</p>
<p align="left">If this fails to incapacitate the PC, the illumian 
immediately restores his sigils to visibility (a free action), hoping to
 win initiative and deliver another sneak attack before fleeing the 
scene -- with or without the item. In any case, the spy prefers escape 
over defeat, knowing that he can return later for another attempt.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="left">If the illumian escapes with the item, he returns to his
 masters in the cabal. He is almost certain to have a significant 
head-start on the characters, though a ranger or other skilled tracker 
might be able to follow his trail if in the wilderness. (In town, he'll 
disappear within minutes thanks to <i>disguise self</i>.)</p>
<p align="left">If he escapes without the item, he lies low for several 
days, allowing the characters to let down their guard. His next strike 
will come when the characters are recuperating from an adventure -- all 
the better to take advantage of their fatigue.</p>
<p align="left">If the characters kill the illumian, his body releases 
the stored Illumian language within for the next 6 rounds in the form of
 ululating gibberish. A DC 15 Listen check allows a PC to make out a 
phrase couched in the nonsense: "You know not what you hold!" (This 
final utterance is a racial trait of the illumians, but it is likely to 
creep out the characters for some time.)</p>
<p align="left">Should the characters capture the illumian instead, he 
tries to pass himself off as having been blackmailed into stealing from 
them; only an opposed Sense Motive check (opposed by the spy's Bluff 
check) or magical divination can detect this falsehood. If the 
characters dawdle in their interrogation, the illumian's magical 
disguise wears off (it lasts less than 10 minutes after the encounter 
begins), which pokes an obvious hole in his tale. Though the illumian 
resists most mundane attempts at coercion, he is far from immune to 
intimidation. Unless mistreated, the illumian spy doesn't bear the PCs 
any ill will, and if they convince him to talk, he admits that the item 
they hold has a particular importance to his cabal. If they offer to 
share the item with his cabal, the spy promises that no further attempts
 will be made upon it. Otherwise, he assures them that his cabal -- or 
others more ruthless -- won't stop trying to recover it.</p>
<p align="left">Regardless of exactly how the encounter plays out, the 
PCs have a mystery (or three) on their hands. What is the significance 
of the item they hold? Who is this strange person (or people), and what 
is the nature of the cabal that employs him? And who else might come 
looking for them? If the spy remains alive, have they made a new enemy, 
or perhaps met a new friend? And what's with those crazy glowing runes, 
anyway?</p>
<p align="left">You don't have to answer any of those questions in this 
first encounter (though you should be ready to explore them in future 
sessions). Whatever the result of the meeting, make sure the characters 
feel like they don't have enough information to continue investigating 
the encounter just yet (that is, unless you're ready to run with it). 
Let them finish up whatever other adventure they're on -- by the time 
they're done, you'll have read the rest of the book and will be ready 
with more mysteries of the illumians to explore.</p>
