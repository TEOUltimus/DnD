In this month's Use This Book Tonight we'll delve into a disturbing little tome called <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/885227200">Heroes of Horror</a></i>.</p>
<p align="left"> As its name suggests, this book is all about introducing elements of the horror genre to your <b>D&amp;D</b> game. Like the previous volume in the Genre Series, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/860900000">Heroes of Battle</a></i>, <i>Heroes of Horror</i>
 is chock full of material both for DMs looking to add a new flavor to 
their game as well as for players who need extra ammunition against the 
inevitable things that go bump in the night. If you've ever wanted to 
run a game inspired by the great classics of horror film and literature 
-- from <i>Dracula</i> to <i>Evil Dead</i>, from <i>Halloween</i> to <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> -- this is the book that'll show you how to do it.</p>
<p align="left">But you needn't change your whole game to benefit from 
the terrifying tips and tricks contained between these covers. You 
easily can add just a little taste of fear to your campaign to remind 
the players that sometimes all the <i>+3 swords</i> in the world aren't 
enough to cope with the stuff out there that warps and corrupts mind and
 body alike. The adventure here is an example of exactly that.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What You Need to Read</b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="2005%20-%2010-21%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Horror_files/dx1021ub_usethisbook_map1.jpg" border="0" height="283" width="450"></p>
<p align="left">Here's what you absolutely, positively have to read before running this encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first sample tainted scholar prestige-class <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a>
 described on page 118. Since he is the primary villain of the 
adventure, you need to familiarize yourself with his attack options -- 
some use new feats or prestige class abilities described in the book. 
Try to skim the rest of the prestige class entry, particularly the 
information on Playing a Tainted Scholar, for tips on how this <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonplayercharacter')">NPC</a> might act when encountered.<br><br></li>
<li>The Hidden Sanctuary map on page 117. It's pretty simple: Area 1 is 
an average wine cellar, with a secret door (Search DC 25) disguising a 
spiral staircase. This leads in turn to a bare stone hallway with a 
dangerous guardian (see below) that stands before a wooden door. Behind 
that door is a meeting room, used when fellow pursuers of hidden 
knowledge visit Vexan to trade secrets. Finally, a steep sloping 
passageway ends in a typical necromancer-type laboratory, complete with 
"operating table" and shelves of various horrific tomes and pickled 
organs. And yes, Vexan sleeps on the table at night -- he's that 
perverted. All rooms but #4 are normally kept dark.<br><br></li>
<li> Consider skimming Chapter 1: Dread Encounters for tips on how to 
add some appropriate flavor to the session. The sections Stand-Alone 
Encounters and Creating Horror are particularly useful in setting the 
stage for an appropriate emotional reaction from players.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>The Encounter</b></p>
<p align="left">A wizard named Vexan has spent too many nights delving 
into forbidden secrets, becoming more and more depraved along the way. 
Now his taint has overwhelmed what remained of his better judgment, and 
he lurks beneath a local tavern, preying on the guests for his foul 
experiments. Though he tells his victims that their deaths are all in 
the name of knowledge and higher learning, for some reason they're never
 reassured. Luckily for them, the terror doesn't usually last more than a
 few days.</p>
<p align="left">Vexan's typical <i>modus operandi</i> is to spy on visitors to the inn (using <i>alter self</i> to take the form of a different stranger each night). When the time is right, he assaults a lone guest with a maximized <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>
 (spontaneously maximized with his blooded metamagic class feature and 
using his blood component class feature to increase his caster level to 
8th). This ensures that the ray will reduce the victim's Strength score 
by a penalty of -8, which is usually enough to render the victim 
virtually incapable of fighting back. If needed to quiet a resisting 
victim, Vexan follows up with a <i>touch of fatigue</i>, further 
reducing the victim's Strength by a -2 penalty. This one-two punch 
reduces an average target to a helpless state, at which point he 
dispatches the victim and uses <i>dimension door</i> to retreat to his lair.</p>
<p align="left">One of Vexan's more prized possessions now guards the 
tainted scholar's subterranean lair. A gray render zombie (as described 
on page 267 in the <i>Monster Manual</i>) stands in the middle of area 
2. It attacks anything other than Vexan, fighting until destroyed. It 
won't pursue fleeing characters.</p>
<p align="left">As written, this adventure is appropriate for four 
characters of levels 4 to 6. For a weaker party, you can have Vexan out 
gathering supplies (or even getting a victim) when the PCs investigate 
his lair. Also, replace the gray render zombie with another zombie from 
the <i>Monster Manual</i>, such as an ogre zombie (CR 3) or one or two 
troglodyte zombies (CR 1 solo or EL 2 together). For slightly tougher 
parties, you could add a <i>glyph of warding</i> with <i>hold person</i>
 cast on the floor just inside room 2 (a gift from a cleric ally of 
Vexan), additional guardians -- such as a spectre or greater shadow -- 
in room 3, and maybe a few shadows in Vexan's company. For a 
particularly challenging fight, have the PCs interrupt Vexan in the 
middle of a gathering of fellow scholars in area 3, adding one, two, or 
more tainted cabalists to the mix, perhaps even with undead minions of 
their own.</p>
<p align="left">This encounter is easy to add to your game. The next 
time the characters visit a local inn, they're unlucky enough to choose 
the one that Vexan lives beneath. It might even be the inn they've been 
frequenting for months -- only now does the tainted scholar's dreadful 
plot come to light.</p>
<p align="left">Vexan doesn't target any of the PCs -- he's smart enough
 not to pick a fight with a group of adventurers. Still, his desperation
 for a new test subject makes him willing to risk picking off someone 
else in the inn at the same time as the characters are present. This 
might be a fellow guest or just an unlucky local who had come in for a 
drink, but it's most effective if the victim is someone that the PCs 
have interacted with at some time. He or she need not be a friend, but 
the adventure will work better if the heroes recognize the NPC's 
absence. If this can't be arranged, instead allow one of the PCs to 
overhear the innkeeper complaining about a guest who disappeared without
 paying his bill: "The third one this month, can you believe that?" 
Players love a mystery, and they particularly enjoy poking their noses 
where they don't necessarily belong, so it shouldn't be too hard to 
entice them into investigating the disappearance of Vexan's latest 
victim.</p>
<p align="left">The investigation could follow a variety of avenues, but
 it eventually should lead to a few tasks. Use the information below to 
adjudicate the search:</p>
<p align="left"><i>Asking Around:</i> A <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 15 Gather Information <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">check</a>
 among the regulars and staff at the inn confirms that the innkeeper has
 started demanding gold up front for all meals and rooms. The same 
result confirms that the last time anyone saw the individual in question
 was last night (either heading back up to his room or leaving the inn, 
as appropriate). Should the PCs cast a wider net, they'll find that no 
other nearby establishments have been experiencing similar problems.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs confront the innkeeper directly, an 
appropriate Diplomacy, Bluff, or Intimidate check (or appropriate magic)
 reveals the following:</p>
<p align="left">"Folks have been skipping out on bar tabs and the like, and I'm tired of being left holding the bag."</p>
<p align="left">In fact, the half-dozen confirmed "disappearances" in 
the last three months are only the tip of the iceberg -- Vexan has 
nabbed more than a dozen victims during that period. He is hesitant to 
let the PCs search through the whole place, but he won't put up much of a
 fight (particularly if they start suggesting that foul play might be 
going on -- he doesn't want any problems with the law).</p>
<p align="left">A DC 20 Gather Information check also reveals that the 
serving wenches have been complaining about the "dead rat" smell in the 
wine cellar lately. This is actually the stench of the rotting zombie 
one floor down, which has begun to permeate the cellar. Any PCs 
venturing down there will note the scent automatically if aware of it; 
otherwise it's noticeable with a DC 10 Wisdom check. Of course, no 
search will turn up any dead rats, though it might locate the secret 
door.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Searching Rooms:</i> A search of any of the missing 
guests' rooms will turn up no left-behind possessions or the like -- 
Vexan took all those with him. Any of the inn staff can confirm that 
these rooms were discovered empty, but still locked from the inside. 
(Vexan uses <i>dimension door</i> to come and go.) A DC 20 Search check 
of any of these rooms finds a few drops of blood near each bed in 
question -- the only sign of the violent death of the guest who once 
lived here -- but no trail to be followed.</p>
<p align="left">Whatever the means used, the PCs eventually discover the
 hidden staircase and head down into the darkness. Be sure to stress the
 sensory components of this place -- the smell (even taste) of blood and
 rot, the still air, the utter quiet (until an attack is sprung), and so
 on. Turn down the lights a bit, maybe put on some eerie music 
(personally, I like <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> or the first few tracks from <i>Aliens</i>).
 Be slow and methodical in your delivery (again, until a fight starts). 
Your goal is to make the players feel like this dank hole is somehow 
different than all the others they've explored before now.</p>
<p align="left">When discovered, Vexan puts up a fight at first, since 
he hates to lose this prime laboratory space and hunting ground. Despite
 his evident symptoms of physical corruption (easily winded and 
suffering from joint pain), he's quite capable of unleashing significant
 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a> on the PCs. He prefers <i>scorching ray</i> (spending 1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoint')">hit point</a> to raise the CL to 8th to add a second ray and spending 2 points of Con to empower it) and either <i>fireball</i> and <i>lightning bolt </i>(again spending 1 hit point to add 1d6 to the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell's</a>
 damage), depending on who's standing where. The first two 
damage-dealing spells he casts will also be debilitating, which deals 4 
points of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Wisdom')">Wisdom</a> damage or 2 points of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Constitution')">Constitution</a> damage to one target of the spell (see the Debilitating Spell feat on page 120). With warning, he casts <i>blur</i> on himself. If outmatched, he doesn't hesitate to use <i>dimension door</i> (or <i>invisibility</i> and <i>expeditious retreat</i>)
 to flee rather than face capture or death. Any other tainted scholars 
encountered use similar tactics, though they avoid using area spells if 
those would catch their allies as well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="left">Vexan could escape the PCs' justice, at least for now. 
Unless the characters really made an impression, the tainted scholar 
isn't likely to seek them out for revenge, though he certainly holds a 
grudge. He could make quite a gruesome recurring villain, as his taint 
continues to affect his mind in unspeakable ways.</p>
<p align="left">Even if Vexan perishes here, he probably has powerful 
allies who eventually come looking for him. Other wizards, clerics, 
dread necromancers, tainted scholars, and similar characters could 
plague the PCs for a long time to come. Thavik of Donegan, the other 
sample tainted scholar, is an example of the top end of such allies (and
 shouldn't be used against the PCs for several levels unless you're 
looking to make enemies of your players).</p>
<p align="left">It's pretty obvious to anyone looking around the 
laboratory that this place has been used for some grisly experiments. 
Thumbing through the well-used books reveals a collection of 
particularly damnable research and theories. A Knowledge (arcana) check 
can reveal information about their owner as described under "Tainted 
Scholar Lore" on page 117.</p>
<p align="left">Exactly where this adventure leads, though, is up to you. Assuming your players enjoyed their brief walk on the horrible side, <i>Heroes of Horror</i> holds plenty more disturbing mysteries for them to explore -- if they dare!</p>
