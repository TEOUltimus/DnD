<p align="left">In the continuing spirit of helping out time-pressed <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">Dungeon Masters</a> with a brand-new book in their hands, this month's Use This Book Tonight column peruses <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/860900000">Heroes of Battle</a></i>.
 This tome, the first in Wizards of the Coast's genre series, explores 
what it means to add a theme of warfare to your campaign, both from a 
mechanical and roleplaying perspective. If you've ever wanted to drop 
your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a>
 into scenes of battlefield glory, this is the book for you. From 
military hierarchies to battlefield terrain, from pregenerated enemy 
units to new skill uses in warfare, <i>Heroes of Battle</i> covers the gamut of issues likely to arise in a warfare-based story arc or campaign.</p>
<p align="left">But PCs needn't be soldiers to get something out of this book. Not only are the feats, prestige classes, magic items, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> useful in a traditional <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, but this book also presents some new options for team-oriented 
PCs of any background. After all, you don't have to be saving a friendly
 soldier pinned behind enemy lines or defending Helm's Deep to know the 
value of teamwork. For your party leader, picking up a commander aura is
 a great way to support the rest of the characters. Teamwork benefits 
help everyone in a group to better accomplish crucial tasks, from 
infiltrating enemy encampments to dodging friendly <i>fireballs</i>.</p>
<p align="left">The encounter presented in this column works regardless 
of whether your PCs are actively involved in military activities. 
Sometimes you don't need to be a soldier for the war to find you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What You Need to Read</b></p>
<p align="left">Here's what you absolutely, positively have to read before running this encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li> Gregor Antus, the sample dread commando <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonplayercharacter')">nonplayer character</a> in Chapter 5, and the stat block for the warriors in his garrison (below). <br><br></li>
<li>Gregor has the Bloodthirsty Commander aura, and the group has 
learned the Superior Flank teamwork benefit; the effects of both are 
summarized below and likely needn't be referenced for this fight.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>The Encounter (EL 9)</b></p>
<p align="left">Without realizing it, the player characters have become 
the target of a local duke or warlord. According to intelligence 
gathered by this individual, the PCs are working as agents for his enemy
 (another nearby ruler or rival to power). It's up to you whether this 
is true; perhaps one of the PCs' mentors or employers is (or has ties 
to) this enemy, or maybe the intelligence is just flat-out wrong. It's 
even possible that someone the characters wronged in a previous 
adventure has set them up. Regardless, the characters are now marked as 
targets, and their new enemy has called in some favors to put a 
professional on their trail. </p>
<p align="left">Gregor Antus is one of the sample dread commandos 
detailed in Chapter 5. For the purpose of this encounter, Gregor is a 
vicious, bloodthirsty commander of troops and currently leads a team of 
six well-trained 3rd-level human warriors (see stat block below). The DM
 should change his <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_alignment')">alignment</a>
 to neutral evil to reflect this. This is a challenging encounter for a 
four-person group of 6th- to 8th-level PCs, and even 9th- or 10th-level 
characters may have a tough time dealing with Gregor's Garrison. 
Consider increasing <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_experiencepoints')">experience point</a> rewards by 10% or so for this team due to their extra abilities.</p>
<p align="left">For lower-level groups, you can reduce the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>
 of the NPCs to reflect the fact that they've already fought a battle or
 two before encountering the PCs. Drop Gregor's hit points to 40, the 
warriors' hit points to 10, and eliminate all <i>potions of cure wounds</i>
 carried by the NPCs. You should also reduce XP rewards for these foes 
by 20%, which lowers the EL to about 7. Be aware that while this makes 
Gregor and his troops more vulnerable to defeat, it doesn't make them 
any less capable of dealing <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a> to the PCs; a single full attack by Gregor against a flanked PC could easily drop that character. </p>
<p align="left">Luckily (?) for the PCs, Gregor is not out to kill them.
 His employer wants to learn more about the characters' activities and 
intentions, and so Gregor seeks to capture one or more of them alive for
 questioning. Thus, he arms himself with a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_masterwork')">masterwork</a> sap (add to his possessions) to use in combat. (Add the following to Gregor's statistics: <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">Atk</a> +9 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee</a> [masterwork sap, 1d6+1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonlethal')">nonlethal</a>];
 Full Atk +9/+4 melee [masterwork sap, 1d6+1 nonlethal].) The rest of 
his garrison attacks normally, relying on Gregor to deal sufficient 
nonlethal damage to render at least one foe <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_unconscious')">unconscious</a> but alive.</p>
<p align="left">The encounter can take place just about anywhere, though
 whatever location is chosen should allow plenty of hiding places (such 
as shadowy alleyways or underbrush) to maximize the ambush potential of 
the NPCs. Gregor's employer has informed him of the PCs' general suite 
of abilities, though newly gained talents (such as a new feat or spell 
known) may be unknown to the dread commando and his team.</p>
<p align="left">This group has spent long hours practicing tactics and 
techniques, making them a well-honed unit. Even if spotted from their 
positions of hiding, the garrison still has a good chance of beating 
some or all of the PCs on their <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> checks; thanks to Gregor's team initiative <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a>
 (a dread commando class feature), he and his allies gain a +2 bonus on 
this roll (included in the statistics). The garrison begins the assault 
with a spread of ranged attacks, preferably from hiding, against as many
 foes as possible (to wound as many as they can before closing to 
melee). This allows them to take advantage of Gregor's Bloodthirsty 
Commander aura, which allows allies within 30 feet of him to deal +1d6 
points of damage to a wounded foe. Remember that any successful attack 
Gregor makes against a flat-footed foe adds not only his own +4d6 points
 of sneak attack damage but also his +1d6 points of sudden strike damage
 (which functions similarly to sneak attack but applies only against <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flatfooted')">flat-footed</a> opponents, not <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flank')">flanked</a> enemies); he doesn't benefit from his own commander aura.</p>
<p align="left">Once the fight has begun, the warriors close to melee 
and concentrate their attacks on wounded enemies. The entire group 
(including Gregor) shares the Superior Flank teamwork benefit. When two 
members of the team flank the same enemy, all members of the team can 
make melee attacks against that enemy as if they also flanked the enemy.
 Not only does this increase more NPCs' chance of hitting, it often 
means that Gregor can deliver a deadly (and surprising) sneak attack 
against a target that he wouldn't otherwise be flanking. For his part, 
Gregor tries to deal at least some amount of nonlethal damage to two or 
more PCs (increasing the chances of taking a living prisoner).</p>
<p align="left">The warriors fight to the death or until Gregor flees or
 is defeated (at which point they scatter). If captured and questioned, 
the warriors have no useful information regarding Gregor's employer -- 
Gregor never told them who was footing the bill -- though they can 
confirm (under duress) that their unit was hired to capture one or more 
of the PCs "because somebody doesn't like who you're working for."</p>
<p align="left">Gregor, on the other hand, doesn't believe he's being 
paid enough to throw his life away. If reduced to 10 or fewer hit 
points, Gregor suggests a truce, offering the knowledge of his 
employer's identity in exchange for his life (and the lives of his 
garrison). If accepted, he orders his warriors to lay down their swords;
 otherwise he endeavors to escape at any cost. He's true to his word -- 
he is far more willing to save his own life than protect the one who 
hired him.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="left">In the likely event that the PCs learn the identity of 
their new enemy, they'll almost certainly seek a reckoning with this 
individual. Depending on the enemy's status, that may or may not be 
prudent (or even possible). It's one thing to take on a ferocious dragon
 in its lair, but going up against a powerful political figure is asking
 for trouble. The PCs may well have to go back to a mentor or other ally
 for assistance, and may even find themselves volunteering for service 
to get their revenge. Whether or not your campaign features an actual 
ongoing war, various military operations are certainly a reality of any 
world with rival factions, so this is a great way to get your players 
interested in the options offered by <i>Heroes of Battle</i>.</p>
<p align="left">If Gregor or any of his garrison survives, word soon 
gets back to his employer about the failure. Unless the PCs have done 
something unusual to anger or embarrass Gregor, he won't seek vengeance 
upon them. Of course, that doesn't mean they won't cross paths with this
 dread commando at some point in the future. It's even conceivable that 
they might end up on the same side of a fight -- Gregor's not picky 
about who fills his purse with gold.</p>
<p align="left">In the event that Gregor's Garrison defeats the PCs, 
they carry off anyone who sustained nonlethal damage. Those reduced to 
negative hit points are left behind and assumed dead (which means the 
PCs could well stabilize and recover on their own). Surviving PCs will 
have to track down their attacker and, eventually, his employer to 
rescue their friends. To keep the players of captured characters 
involved, you can allow them to create new characters -- perhaps sent by
 the NPC ally who inadvertently got them into all this mess -- or you 
can run the infiltration while simultaneously interweaving some 
roleplaying-heavy interludes featuring a confrontation between the 
captured PCs and their new enemy!</p>
