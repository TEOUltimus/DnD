<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2001-20%20-%20Complete%20Adventurer_files/compadv_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="195" width="152">Last month, we presented the first installment of <i>Use This Book Tonight</i>, which showed the DM who had just purchased <i>Races of Destiny</i> how to use it in his game with virtually no prep work.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This month, we take a look at another brand-new title: <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/177290000">Complete Adventurer</a></i>. In the vein of previous titles in the series (such as <i>Complete Warrior</i>),
 this book explores a variety of topics of interest to those characters 
who focus on skills over sword or spell, but also holds plenty of 
options for fighters and wizards looking to branch out a bit. From feats
 and skill uses to spells, exotic gear, and prestige classes, this book 
is absolutely loaded with options.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Take the beastmaster prestige class, for example. If 
your barbarian or fighter has ever envied the druid's ferocious pet 
wolf, or even if you already have an animal companion but want to amp up
 the ability (or perhaps gain additional companions), this class is for 
you. With prerequisites that can be met by just about any martial- or 
nature-oriented character by 5th level, the beastmaster offers plenty of
 payoff -- full base attack bonus, four skill points per level, and of 
course, a loyal animal companion that is nearly the equal of the 
druid's. (And no, you don't have to dress in a loincloth -- unless you 
want to, of course!)</p>
<p align="LEFT">To support this character (as well as all the many other characters who bring pets to the dungeon) <i>Complete Adventurer</i> also presents additional information on the Handle Animal skill, including 10 tricks that you won't find in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 If you've ever wanted to teach your dire bear to grapple the enemy 
spellcaster or train your pet monkey to swipe the evil high priest's <i>rod of rulership</i> from his pack, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What You Need to Read</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here's what you absolutely, positively have to read before running this encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li> Sample beastmaster NPC in Chapter 2. No way to get around this one,
 since you'll need the stat block for the encounter. Thankfully, though,
 all the class features are familiar even without reading the rest of 
the book, so you should be able to run this one without any significant 
cross-referencing. See "The Encounter," below, for details on using the 
NPC.<br><br></li>
<li> Consider reviewing the "Assist Attack" trick in Chapter 3; it's also summarized below.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Encounter</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Eventually, every team of adventurers visits a town or 
city, and that's where this encounter occurs. Whether the PCs have just 
returned from delving into a ruined temple or living the high life 
thanks to the loads of gold they've "liberated" from dragon lairs is 
immaterial -- this encounter doesn't involve their past activities. 
Nope, this time the PCs are just innocent victims of a ranger who has 
gone a little feral. If this encounter can take place while the 
characters are otherwise involved in an adventure, so much the better --
 it gives you some breathing room should they get interested in Leena's 
past.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Leena of the Mean Streets is the sample beastmaster 
detailed in Chapter 2. Though her default alignment is neutral good, 
change that to neutral for the purpose of this encounter. She doesn't 
have to be evil to have formed a negative opinion of her own race, but 
she's definitely not a good person any more (assuming she ever was). 
Whether wronged once too many times by a conniving merchant, abused by 
the local constabulary, or just not quite right in the head, Leena has 
decided that humanity simply can't be trusted any longer. For the last 
several months, she has been hunting her fellow humans in the town or 
city currently occupied by the characters. So far, authorities have just
 chalked up the deaths to sewer rats, not suspecting that a more 
intelligent villain is behind the scheme.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Two other minor adjustments are necessary to run this encounter. First, increase Leena's speed to 40 feet (thanks to her <i>longstrider</i>
 spell, which has a duration of 2 hours). Second, add "assist attack" to
 the list of tricks known by Manster, Leena's dire rat companion. The 
dire rat currently knows three tricks, but is eligible for up to two 
more based on Leena's animal companion class feature. (The fifth trick 
doesn't really matter, but feel free to add another to the rat's list if
 desired.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">A 7th-level NPC, Leena is a reasonable challenge for a 
group of 5th- to 7th-level PCs, particularly since she'll be attacking 
from ambush. Against 3rd- or 4th-level characters, she represents a 
severe challenge, but still isn't an unreasonable encounter; that said, 
you might choose to have the PCs run into her right after she has killed
 another victim (reducing her hit points to 40 due to injuries from the 
fight). If your PCs are 8th level or higher, consider adding a pack of 
dire rats (say, a half-dozen per level above 7th) to her entourage -- 
though these animals aren't loyal companions, and they enjoy none of the
 benefits that Manster does, they have been taught the attack and assist
 attack tricks by Leena and follow her for the reward of food. 
Characters above 10th level probably won't find any variation of this 
encounter challenging (though a trio of beastmasters with similar 
statistics might give even 12th-level PCs a run for their money, 
particularly if the PCs are coming off another encounter).</p>
<p align="LEFT">As the encounter begins, the characters are on a quiet 
city street after dark. Maybe they're exploring the seedy side of town, 
but that's not necessary -- Leena takes her prey wherever she can. The 
important point is that no help will arrive for at least a minute after 
the fight begins. Leena knows nothing about the PCs -- she just doesn't 
like people.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While Leena waits around a corner in a nearby alley (30 
to 40 feet from the party), Manster scuttles from her position across 
the street into another alley. Any character who succeeds at a DC 10 
Knowledge (local) check (or a DC 10 Intelligence check) remembers that 
the city has suffered a rash of dire rat attacks recently. If they don't
 immediately follow the rat, it pokes its head out as if to taunt them. 
It retreats if ranged attacks are used, but the characters can still 
hear it scratching and gnawing.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eventually, the characters move to investigate, and 
that's when Leena springs her trap. From opposite sides of the street, 
she (possibly with dire rats in tow) and Manster move to flank a lone 
opponent. She delays her attack until after Manster moves into position.
 For its part, the dire rat doesn't try to injure characters directly, 
instead using aid another to assist Leena's attack (see Chapter 8: 
Combat in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Chances are that the characters
 haven't ever seen a rat use tactics, so this in itself might be enough 
to set them on edge. Any other rats present use similar tactics, which 
should dramatically improve Leena's ability to deal damage in combat. 
Even with only Manster flanking and aiding, her attack bonuses go up to 
+14/7 with her scimitar and +12 with her short sword (only the first 
attack gets the bonus from aid another). And if that foe happens to be a
 human, she adds +4 on all her damage rolls!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Leena fights until reduced to less than 20 hp, then 
takes off running while ordering any remaining dire rats to scatter. If 
Manster is slain, she focuses her attacks on the character that killed 
Manster, but not to the point of stupidity (there are plenty more rats 
in the sewers, after all). Thanks to her speed of 40 feet, she's 
probably capable of getting away from all but the most determined (and 
fleet-footed) pursuers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aftermath</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Should Leena escape, the dire-rat-aided killings 
continue. She bears no special grudge toward the characters (she won't 
try to hunt them down, for example), and avoids them if she fears the 
result of a rematch. Tracking her down quickly might be a tough endeavor
 unless the PCs have someone capable at gathering information or 
otherwise following her trail. Eventually, though, she'll be back out on
 the street hunting human prey, so it's probably only a matter of time 
before dedicated investigators run her to ground.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If and when the PCs defeat Leena, they've solved a local
 mystery of some significance. A reward for the group is almost 
certainly in order -- something in the neighborhood of 100 gp times the 
average party level is probably appropriate. If the DM wants to extend 
this chance encounter into a full-blown adventure, perhaps one of the 
victims' family members approaches them with a request to recover some 
item carried by the victim (but not held by Leena when defeated). This 
might take the form of a locket, a diary, or some other personal 
possession of emotional value, and would require locating Leena's 
hideout (probably an abandoned building, sewer tunnel, or similarly 
unpleasant location that is almost certainly teeming with dire rats 
and/or rat swarms).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Or perhaps the characters find Leena's own journal among
 her possessions, which details her hatred for the human race, including
 specific names of those who forged this emotion. This diary might 
reveal the identity of a corrupt government official, guildmaster, or 
other figure of power, which leads the characters in an entirely 
different direction.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Regardless of the direction this encounter leads, 
consider putting the investigation in the background while the 
characters pursue other adventures. Let them make a few Gather 
Information checks and tell them you'll get back to them with the 
results at the next game. That gives you plenty of time to read through 
more of the book to find more material to use in the newly inspired 
adventure, whether that's a bloodhound on the same trail as the PCs, a 
pack of streetfighters laying claim to the turf that the PCs are 
investigating, or a team of ninjas sent to retrieve Leena's damning 
journal before it surfaces and ruins the reputation of a powerful lord.</p>
