<p align="CENTER"><b></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>W</b>elcome to the first of what will hopefully be several, or even many, columns that focus on playing a bard in the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> game. You've likely read, or heard it said, bards make some of the best solo-style characters in <b>D&amp;D</b>.
 They're second best at just about everything: They fight respectably, 
cast spells from a decent spell list, perform some roguelike trickery, 
and even chime in with a valuable piece of obscure information once in a
 while. This makes for a well-rounded character with few exploitable 
weaknesses, but there's a drawback to that, as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Being second best at everything makes you first best at nothing. In a party with a skull-cracking fighter, a <i>fireball</i>-throwing
 wizard, and the greatest pickpocketing rogue in three counties, finding
 your place in the party can be a little intimidating. Don't let this 
distress you. There's quite a few ways a bard can make his or her unique
 abilities felt.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2001-03%20-%20The%20Beginning%20Bard_files/bk_devis_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="245" width="161">At
 the end of the day, it's all about beatin' up on the bad guys, isn't 
it? As a beginning bard, you'll be happy to hear some good news and not 
so thrilled at the bad news. The bard base attack bonus progression 
isn't bad; it's on par with the other half-casters. However, you are 
tied with the rogue for the smallest Hit Die in that group (d6) and you 
won't see a sneak attack in your future to make up for this lack of hit 
points. You also have one, and only one, weapon proficiency beyond 
simple weapons. Unless you have a cool story reason for choosing the 
whip, your weapon choice rapidly narrows down to the composite longbow 
or the rapier. As much as I like the rapier, it's one of those up-close 
weapons, and you'll recall the thing I mentioned about the Hit Die 
earlier.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For my money, archery is the way to go, and the reasons 
are simple. First, you're only two feats away from a second attack by 
taking Point Blank Shot and Rapid Shot, and thus you can have that 
second attack even before the pure fighters, regardless of your race. 
Rapid Shot gives both of your attacks a -2 penalty, but Point Blank Shot
 mitigates this somewhat by granting a +1 bonus if the target is within 
30 feet. Combine that with the bardic music inspire courage ability, 
which grants a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, among other things, and a
 singing bard can make two ranged attacks at targets within 30 feet at 
no penalty to hit. Even more importantly, being an archer keeps you off 
the front lines, which is where those d10 and d12 HD fighters and 
barbarians (respectively) get paid to stand. In addition, magic bows are
 exceptionally potent since they transfer their magic and additional 
damage bonuses onto the arrows they fire.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bardic Music</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Many people often overlook the benefits of bardic music.
 The reason it's overlooked is pretty obvious: the phrase "once per day 
per level." That's a pretty rough restriction at 1st level, but the 
benefits of making good use of your bardic music ability more than make 
up for the frustration of not getting to use it all that often. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A 1st level, the bard has the capacity for three different bardic music effects: inspire courage, countersong, and <i>fascinate</i>.
 Of these three, inspire courage is the clear leader in pure usefulness.
 It grants a +1 bonus on both attack and damage rolls, in addition to a 
+2 bonus against fear and charm effects. That's a +1 on attack and 
damage rolls -- for everyone in the party AND for a minimum of 5 rounds 
-- at 1st level. Not too shabby. <i>Countersong</i> does exactly what it
 sounds like it does, and when you can perform your music only once or 
twice per day, it doesn't see a lot of use. You should, however, keep it
 in mind for later levels since you never know when it will save your 
party from a <i>sound burst</i> or something similar. <i>Fascinate</i> 
is a great little ability in the right circumstances. Successfully 
fascinating a creature applies a -4 penalty on the creature's Spot and 
Listen checks for as long as its attention remains focused on you. You 
should have a lot of uses for this ability, but perhaps the best part of
 it is that it encourages a bit of teamwork within the party. Sing a 
little song for the noble of ill-repute while the rogue checks her 
baggage for stolen items and if any are found, the paladin can have a 
little talk with her.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Roleplay</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">My very favorite aspect of playing a bard is the 
opportunity for roleplaying that it provides. While any character can be
 fun to roleplay, bards have the advantage of a few built in hooks that 
can be pretty entertaining. For my favorite, I refer you back to the 
beginning of this column: Bards make great solo characters. Sure, he's 
in a party now, but a bard has been around the block a few times and can
 take care of himself. Your character might exhibit this in many ways. 
Maybe he's got a story for every occasion: "Wow, that's a lot of orcs 
out there. Reminds me of this one time near the Silver Marches -- orcs 
as far as the eye could see. Big orcs, too, not like these guys. You 
should'a seen it." Or maybe he couches all of his advice in a story of 
his glorious past: "'Bout three years ago I freed this small village 
down south from the clutches of some evil bandits. These bandits set 
their camp up very much like our enemies here have. Here's what worked 
for me when I attacked those bandits." Or maybe he just likes to remind 
everyone that he's multitalented: "Well, maybe if someone had spent more
 time learning the tales of her people instead simply swinging a sword 
around like a lunatic every day, then someone wouldn't need my help to 
get out of this mess, eh?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">Next time we'll hit on a few more roleplaying ideas and look at the bard's ability and skill selection.</p>
