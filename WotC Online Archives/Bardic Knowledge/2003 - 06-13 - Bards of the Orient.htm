<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The <i>Oriental Adventures</i> book brings the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>
 game system to the world of Rokugan, a land of fantasy and adventure 
based on the stories and writings of Japan, China, India, and the 
greater region known to us westerners as the Far East. This is all well 
and good, but as you peruse the <i>Oriental Adventures</i> book, you may notice one little problem -- no bards.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The <i>Oriental Adventures</i> book explains that the bard and a few other classes from the <i>Player's Handbook</i> are not appropriate to the setting of Rokugan. The world of <b>Greyhawk, </b>the default setting for<b> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>, is culturally very different from Rokugan, and <i>Oriental Adventures</i> says that while traveling performers/adventurers make a good deal of sense within the <b>Greyhawk</b> setting, they don't fit in the world of Rokugan.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 I certainly wouldn't argue with the book's position on this issue, I 
also hate to see my favorite class absent from this rich world. So, 
while a bard may not be appropriate for Rokugan, I see no reason why all
 adventures set in the Orient also have to be set in Rokugan, and I'd 
like to see what kind of bard I can bring to the Far East and what kind 
of bard I can get out of <i>Oriental Adventures</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Taking Mohammed to the Mountain</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First, let's see how we can bring our <b>D&amp;D</b> bard over to the Orient (as in bringing it to the<i> Oriental Adventures</i>
 setting, not just bringing a bard character to the actual Orient; I'm 
fairly certain someone's already done that). The first obstacle is 
concept: the standard bard idea of the roving minstrel wandering the 
countryside in search of adventure, excitement, songs, and magic has a 
few problems in this new setting. While entertainment is certainly 
highly valued, the entertainers of this fantasy Far East setting rarely 
rove. Instead a valued singer or musician would be tied to a major clan 
or castle, and hearing them perform would be seen as an attraction of 
visiting that castle, bringing honor and prestige to the castle and its 
lord. Such a performer would spend the majority of his time perfecting 
his art, with little time left over for adventuring, even if he were to 
travel. Since freedom of spirit and lifestyle are as central to the bard
 concept as performing, what we need to find is a group of people who 
can move about freely within the <i>Oriental Adventures</i> setting in the same way a bard moves about in the core <b>D&amp;D</b> world. As it turns out, there is such a group: monks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Monk may well be a class both in regular <b>D&amp;D</b> and in <i>Oriental Adventures</i>,
 but it's also a social class, and not all of them necessarily fall 
under what our game would call the monk class. To say it another way, 
not all monks know kung fu. In the Eastern cultures upon which our 
setting is based, the term monk covers a wide variety of people. 
Oftentimes when fighting men retired, they became monks and sought inner
 peace in their remaining years. Also, orphaned children might be raised
 as monks by the monks of a monastery. Someone pursuing religion full 
time would be a monk, and since neither the monasteries nor the 
orphanages were the most formal of places, anyone who wanted to look and
 act like a monk could be, more or less by default, a monk. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 monk stands apart from the social order of peasants and samurai. By not
 being a peasant, a monk is not expected to farm, but not being a 
samurai or noble the monk also doesn't own anything, like food or 
somewhere to sleep. A monk's survival is in the hands of those around 
him. In short, he begs. In the <i>Oriental Adventures</i> society, 
begging does not carry with it the same connotations that exist in 
Western culture. Here begging is seen as good for the soul; it teaches 
humility and reminds you that if you're not working the fields or 
fighting to protect them, you're living on the good will of those who 
do. Fortunately, the culture encourages that good will since it's 
considered good luck to give to one attempting to learn humility in such
 a way. By giving to those who beg, you remind yourself why it is you 
toil in the fields or risk your life with the sword, and you continue a 
tradition that may well benefit you later in life should you decide that
 the way of the monk is a path you wish to pursue. (Yes, this is a 
vastly simplified explanation of a very complicated social, religious, 
and economic system, but it's good enough for our purposes here today.) </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 it's a long way from an easy life, this is the only real social class 
that affords the type of freedom that a bard needs to be a bard, so 
let's say that our <i>Oriental Adventures</i> bards shave their heads 
and move about the countryside looking very much like monks. Since this 
entails a few lifestyle changes, I'll take this opportunity to do a 
quick class write-up on the new <i>Oriental Adventures</i> bard, while sticking as close to the original bard as possible and making changes where needed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><i><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Oriental Adventures</span></i><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;"> Bard</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wandering
 across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with 
his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience: Such is the life
 of a bard. When chance or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards
 serve as diplomats, negotiators, messengers, advisors, and teachers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Like other bards, the <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 bard's magic also comes from the heart. With a good heart, a bard can 
use his knowledge and abilities to aid the people his journeys bring him
 to and, with an evil heart, he can use those same skills to confound 
and deceive. At all times, though, the bard remembers that it is his 
audience, and only his audience, that sustains him by keeping him fed 
when hungry and sheltered when cold.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Adventures:</b>
 Bards see adventures as opportunities both to learn and to teach. By 
participating in these adventures, a bard hones his skills, increases 
his knowledge, and encounters new lands, people, and ideas. The more 
exotic and rare the knowledge gained, the more exciting it is to the 
bard. A bard often accompanies heroes, or villains, to experience their 
deeds firsthand, offering what advice or assistance he can to be an 
active participant whenever possible, and then sharing the tales and 
lessons learned there with others he encounters. It is this desire to 
experience, and then to share these experiences, that separates the bard
 from the monk or rogue.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Races:</b>
 Most bards are human, although it's not unheard of to encounter a 
hengeyokai or spirit folk bard and the natural curiosity of the nezumi 
occasionally draws one of them into the life of a bard for a time. For a
 human bard, the opportunity to meet and exchange stories with one of 
these nonhuman bards is a rare treat indeed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Characteristics:</b><i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 bards have the same characteristics as normal bards, but their music 
often takes the form of ritual chants for the more religious bards or 
epic or travel poetry for the more scholarly bards.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In all other ways, the <i>Oriental Adventures</i> bard follows the bard rules guidelines as listed in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> with the following exception:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b>
 A bard is proficient with all simple weapons. Additionally, the bard is
 proficient with one of the following weapons: composite longbow, 
composite shortbow, kama, kawanaga, kusari-gama, or whip. Bards are 
proficient with light armor and medium armor. Armor check penalties 
apply as listed in the bard entry in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Taking the Mountain to Mohammed</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While tweaking the bard class to fit the <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 setting is one way to go about playing a bard with a Far East flavor, 
there is another way. Let's take a look at the classes available to us 
in <i>Oriental Adventures</i> and see if we can find a character in there that's a bard in spirit, if not in name.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Having decided that the monk social class was a good place in which to put the bard in the <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 world, I wanted to start my search for the hidden bard in the monk 
class -- and the three monk prestige classes -- listed in the book. We 
start off with a very basic clash: The bard alignment restriction is any
 nonlawful while the monk alignment restriction is any lawful. However, 
despite this fundamental difference of outlook, there may well be some 
common ground from which to work. For instance, in the monk class 
description it says, "In Rokugan, although monks tend to have different 
goals and values than members of the other classes, they believe that 
they have an obligation to teach and work among the broader population 
of the Empire." That's a decent start, and if one of the monk prestige 
classes builds on that, we might have a good match.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Henshin Mystic:</b>
 The henshin mystics believe in and seek out enlightenment to achieve 
perfection. They often wander the Empire teaching others and helping 
them on their own road to enlightenment. The wandering teacher part is 
cool, but it's not quite what I was looking for. Looking at the stat 
requirements for this prestige class, I find that you need 6 ranks in 
Knowledge (arcane) and 13 ranks in Knowledge (religion), along with a +7
 base attack. That's 10 levels of monk before you begin wandering around
 to teach enlightenment, and 10 levels of monk is a whole lot of kung fu
 (something I was trying to avoid). Looking at the level progression, 
the first level in henshin mystic grants a spell-like ability, and every
 level thereafter grants more kung fu. I don't think this is the class 
I'm looking for.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Shintao Monk:</b> Concerned about not being able to avoid the kung fu, I looked at the stat requirements right away.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Alignment:</b> Lawful good.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Base Will Save Bonus:</b> +4.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skills:</b> Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Special:</b> Still mind class ability.</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="right" bgcolor="#F5F5F5" width="250"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>About that Gather Information Skill</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you decide to make your character take on aspects of the bard in a setting similar to that presented in <i>Oriental Adventures,</i> here is an instrument to assist in that regard!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Biwa of Listening: </b>The biwa is a stringed instrument similar to a lute. When played, the <i>biwa of lore gathering</i>
 produces mellow, muted tones. If the performer makes a successful 
Perform check (DC 15), the tones elevate the performer's ability to hear
 nearby conversations (+4 bonus on Listen checks). Upon command, and if 
the performer succeeds at an additional Perform check (DC 20) after at 
least 1 round of playing, he or she also gains the benefit of bardic 
knowledge with a bonus equal to half the performer's ranks in the 
Perform skill (round down) + his or her Intelligence modifier for 1 
hour. For instance, a performer with 9 ranks in Perform and who has an 
Intelligence of 14 has a +6 bonus. (See Chapter 3 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more on bardic knowledge.) Merely holding the biwa grants the user a +4 bonus on Gather Information checks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 10th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>legend lore,</i> Gather Information skill, Listen skill, Perform skill; <i>Market Price:</i> 29,600 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 3 lb.</span></p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That's
 pretty good. Monks pick up still mind at 3rd level, and they get the 
Will save required at 4th level. That's very little kung fu -- 
comparatively speaking, of course. The description of this prestige 
class reads, "NPC Shintao monks serve as teachers and guides on the path
 of enlightenment. Many are advisors to daimyos or lesser nobles, but 
most live fairly reclusive lives in their monasteries and temples." 
Teachers, advisors, low kung fu . . . if it weren't for that whole 
"lawful good" thing, this prestige class would be a real contender. As 
you progress as a Shintao monk, you gain a few fighting abilities, but 
mostly you gain things that look suspiciously like spells, and some of 
them look like spells a bard would cast. For instance: Touch the Void 
dragon raises one ability score by 1d4+1, much the way <i>cat's grace</i>, a 2nd-level bard spell, raises Dexterity. So far, as long as you want to be a good bard, this is the closest we can get.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tattooed Monk:</b>
 The tattooed monks come from specialized schools where they receive, 
you guessed it, tattoos. The most striking thing about this prestige 
class is the special abilities gained during level progression. Starting
 at 1st level, and every other level thereafter, you gain a tattoo. 
Choose from a list of tattoos; they all do different spell-like or 
ability stuff, and you can take the same one more than once. If that's 
not customization, I don't know what is. You'll still have to be lawful,
 though, but this class does have one of the cooler requirements for 
entry: You have to be accepted to one of the Tattooed monk schools. A 
roleplay-based requirement -- what could be better? It may not be 
overtly bardlike, but it's neat.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I did see one other place where we might find <i>Oriental Adventures'</i> built-in bard: the shaman class. A shaman in <i>Oriental Adventures </i>is
 pretty much a low-combat-ability, wide-concept-range cleric. So, for 
the most part, he's really more like a cleric than a bard, but clerics 
are not entirely unlike bards and the freedom granted in the flavor of 
the shaman allows for a great deal of customization. Shamans are found 
among all the races, may be of any alignment, and cast spells from a 
decent spell list as well as gain spells from your choice of two of the 
twenty available domains. With the wide-open nature of the shaman, you 
could quite possibly create a shaman character and play it largely as 
you would a bard, and still be well within the shaman concept. If only 
the shaman had some sort of ability to use Gather Information more 
easily.</span></p>
