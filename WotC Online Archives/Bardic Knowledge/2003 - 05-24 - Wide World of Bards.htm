<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 diversity is the strength of the bard, then a column that examines just
 how diverse bards can be ought to be fairly interesting. That, at 
least, is the idea with which I started. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I
 said earlier in the Phenomenal Cosmic Power article that I thought that
 7th level was among the best of the bard levels, so I set out to build 
three different bard characters at 7th level to see how different the 
faces of a bard can be. Obviously, whenever you make a character, there 
is a lot of give and take and numerous judgment calls to make. I've made
 these characters using just the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide, </i>and
 I stuck to fairly standard rules and items. Since I can't be there with
 everyone who might read this to flip through books and debate the finer
 points of character building, I've gone with a simplicity-first 
strategy so that even people who have never made a bard character before
 can follow along fairly easily. I don't claim that these are the best 
characters in the world; they're just the ones I made.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Bard-Archer</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To
 me, the default direction you should go with a bard is as a combat 
support archer and a support caster that can fill either role in a 
pinch, but who is outclassed by the pure warriors or the pure casters in
 a side-by-side comparison. I used the standard point-buy system found 
in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> at 25 points for all the characters. For the most part, I focused on high Charisma and Dexterity.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Take a look at the stat block below, and then we'll check out the basic highlights.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bard-Archer:</b>
 Male elf Bard7; CR 7; Medium-size humanoid; HD 7d6; hp 24; Init +3; Spd
 30 ft.; AC 19, touch 13, flat-footed 16; Atk +5 melee (1d6/19-20, short
 sword), or +12 ranged (1d8+2/x3, <i>+1 composite longbow </i>with <i>+1 shock arrows</i>); SQ bardic knowledge +8, bardic music (countersong, <i>fascinate,</i> inspire competence, inspire courage, <i>suggestion</i>) 7/day, elf traits; AL CG; SV Fort +2, Ref +8, Will +4; Str 10, Dex 16, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 8, Cha 16. </span></p>

 Balance +5, Concentration +10, Gather Information +13, Hide +13, Jump 
+2, Listen +1, Perform +13, Search +3, Spot +1, Tumble +13; Point Blank 
Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b>
 The bard-archer may make a bardic knowledge check with a +8 bonus to 
see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable 
people, legendary items, or noteworthy places.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Music:</b> The bard-archer can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Countersong (Su):</i>
 The bard can counter magical effects that depend on sound by making a 
Perform check for each round of countersong. Any creature within 30 feet
 of the bard who is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical 
attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of his or her 
saving throw if desired. Countersong lasts for 10 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fascinate <i>(Sp):</i>
 The bard can cause a single creature within 90 feet that can see and 
hear him to become fascinated with him. The bard's Perform check result 
is the DC for the opponent's Will save. Any obvious threat breaks the 
effect. Fascination lasts 7 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Competence (Su):</i>
 An ally within 30 feet who can see and hear the bard gets a +2 
competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill for as long as 
he or she can hear the music. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i>
 Allies who can hear the bard receive a +2 morale bonus to saves against
 charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus to attack and weapon 
damage rolls The effect lasts for 5 rounds after the ally can no longer 
hear the bard. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Suggestion <i>(Sp):</i> The bard can make a <i>suggestion</i> (as the spell) to a creature he has already fascinated. A Will save with (DC 16) negates the effect.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Elf Traits:</b>
 The bard-archer is immune to magic sleep spells and effects. He has a 
+2 racial bonus on saves against enchantment spells or effects and 
low-light vision (can see twice as far as a human in low-light 
conditions). The bard-archer is entitled to a Search check when within 5
 feet of a secret or concealed door as though actively looking for it. 
He has Martial Weapon Proficiency (composite longbow, composite 
shortbow, longbow, longsword, and rapier) as bonus feats. The 
bard-archer also has a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search 
checks (already figured into the statistics given above).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bard Spells Known</b> (3/4/3/1; save DC 13 + spell level; 15% chance of spell failure): 0 -- <i>daze, detect magic, flare, ghost sound, mage hand, prestidigitation; </i>1st -- <i>charm person, expeditious retreat, mage armor, sleep;</i> 2nd -- <i>cat's grace, invisibility, see invisibility, sound burst;</i> 3rd -- <i>greater magic weapon, haste.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Possessions: +1 buckler, mithral shirt, +1 composite longbow, shock arrows </i>(50),<i> potion of haste </i>(2),<i> ring of swimming, wand of cure light wounds </i>(50 charges),<i> bracers of archery, Heward's handy haversack, </i>bedroll,

<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>AC:</b> 19.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Attack:</b> +12 with <i>+1 composite longbow</i> (not counting Rapid Shot or Point Blank Shot) with a +2 enhancement bonus coming from <i>greater magic weapon</i> cast on the arrows. (As a reminder, if the bard uses <i>greater magic weapon</i> on the arrows, the +1 bonus from the arrows no longer applies since the bonuses don't stack.)</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Damage:</b> 1d8+2 + 1d6 (<i>shock arrow</i>) (with an additional +1 from the <i>bracers of archery </i>if within 30 feet).</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell DC:</b> 14 for 1st-level spells.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spells:</b><i>Cat's grace, expeditious retreat, greater magic weapon, haste, invisibility, mage armor, sound burst.</i></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skills:</b> Nothing of real note, +13 on Hide, Gather Information, and Perform.</span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Heward's handy haversack</i> filled lots of things a bard adventurer might need and the item I consider obligatory: a <i>wand of</i><i>cure light wounds</i>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All
 in all, I'd call this pretty much what I expected, and about average. 
Of course, I tend to play a lot of bards and rogues, so my expectations 
might be a bit different than those of someone used to seeing the damage
 dealt out by fighters and barbarians.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm
 pretty much always happy with an Armor Class near 20, especially on 
someone not intended to be on the front lines and who has the ability to
 either become invisible or beat a decent retreat with <i>expeditious retreat</i> or <i>haste</i>.
 He can take two shots at targets within 30 feet at +12 and deal an 
average of 10 points of damage per hit. How good these attack and damage
 stats are depends on what you're comparing them to, but it's safe to 
say that they're likely better than a wizard and worse than a barbarian.
 A 1st-level spell DC of 14 is not great, but very few of the bard's 
spells allow for a saving throw, so it doesn't come up all that often. <i>Sound burst</i> and <i>sleep</i> are the only offensive spells in this bard's arsenal, and if this bard cast <i>sound burst</i>
 on himself (or someone just like him), he'd save against the stunning 
effect about half the time. A more well-rounded bard might have his 
skill points distributed a bit more evenly, with some points in Climb 
and Swim or wherever seems appropriate to you.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm
 not including the bonuses from bardic music because my plan is to 
compare between bards, but if I was comparing with other classes, I 
would want to include the +1 on attack and damage rolls from <i>inspire courage</i>, and the <i>fascinate</i> and <i>suggestion</i> abilities in the tally, as well.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Bard-Spellslinger</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 idea of a dedicated spellcasting bard has always seemed a bit shaky to 
me, but no one I know has ever actually tried it, so I was curious to 
give it a shot. My goal was to increase the bard's spell save DC as high
 as I could with Charisma-boosting items and anything else I could think
 of, and then find as many ways as possible on the bard spell list to be
 an active spellcasting member of a party. In retrospect, I'm not 
completely convinced this was the best of all possible strategies, but 
let's check it out and see how it stacks up to the archer.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Take a look at the statistics, or just check out the highlights:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>AC:</b> 13 (17 with <i>mage armor </i>and up to 24 when also using the <i>wand of</i><i>shield</i>)</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Attack:</b> +6 with a whip.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Damage:</b> 1d2.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell DC:</b> 16 for 1st-level spells.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spells:</b><i>Bestow curse, blindness/deafness, charm person, hold person, sleep, summon monster III.</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bard-Spellslinger:</b>
 Female human Bard 7; CR 7; Medium-size humanoid; HD 7d6; hp 24; Init 
+1; Spd 30 ft.; AC 13, touch 13, flat-footed 12; Atk +6 ranged (1d2,

 Concentration +10, Decipher Script +11, Knowledge (arcana) +11, Perform
 +15, Spellcraft +11, Use Magic Device +15; Combat Casting, Spell Focus 
(Enchantment), Spell Focus (Transmutation), Spell Penetration.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b>
 The bard-spellslinger may make a bardic knowledge check with a +8 bonus
 to see whether she knows some relevant information about local notable 
people, legendary items, or noteworthy places.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Music:</b> The bard-spellslinger can use her song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around her. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Countersong (Su):</i>
 The bard-spellslinger can counter magical effects that depend on sound 
by making a Perform check for each round of countersong. Any creature 
within 30 feet of the bard who is affected by a sonic or 
language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check 
result in place of his or her saving throw if desired. Countersong lasts
 for 10 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fascinate <i>(Sp):</i>
 The bard-spellslinger can cause a single creature within 90 feet that 
can see and hear her to become fascinated with her. The bard's Perform 
check result is the DC for the opponent's Will save. Any obvious threat 
breaks the effect. Fascination lasts 7 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Competence (Su):</i>
 An ally within 30 feet who can see and hear the bard-spellslinger gets a
 +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill for as long
 as he or she can hear the music. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i>
 Allies who can hear the bard-spellslinger receive a +2 morale bonus to 
saves against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus to attack and
 weapon damage rolls The effect lasts for 5 rounds after the ally can no
 longer hear the bard. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Suggestion <i>(Sp):</i> The bard-spellslinger can make a <i>suggestion</i> (as the spell) to a creature he has already fascinated. A Will save with (DC 18) negates the effect.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bard Spells Known</b> (3/5/3/1; save DC 15 + spell level, or 17 + spell level for enchantment and transmutation spells): 0 -- <i>detect magic, light, mage hand, open/close, prestidigitation, read magic; </i>1st -- <i>charm person, mage armor, sleep, summon monster I; </i>2nd -- <i>blindness/deafness, blur, hold person, invisibility;</i> 3rd -- <i>bestow curse, summon monster III.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Possessions:</i> dagger (2), whip, masterwork shortbow, arrows (50), <i>ring of protection +2,</i><i>wand of cure light wounds</i> (50 charges), <i>wand of shield</i> (50 charges), <i>circlet of persuasion, cloak of Charisma</i>
 (+2)*, belt pouch (3), backpack, candle, explorer's outfit, hooded 
lantern, inkpen, masterwork musical instrument, musical instrument (2), 
paper (3 sheets), parchment (1 sheet), scroll cases (3), small steel 
mirror, vial of ink, 514 gp.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">*Already figured into stats above.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Clearly
 we're giving up a lot in the normal attack department, but that's not 
inherently a bad thing. We're also losing a little in AC when we're 
unprepared, so it's pretty important to stay away from the front lines, 
at least until you have <i>mage armor</i> and <i>shield</i> up. Since <i>shield</i>
 isn't on the bard spell list, she's going to need to activate it with 
her Use Magic Device skill. The DC for this is 20, but with a +17 to her
 roll (remember the <i>circlet of persuasion</i>?), this bard can count on being protected most of the time.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 the bard-spellslinger isn't any better in melee than a wizard, and 
there's always the option of not taking the whip as the bard weapon 
proficiency and actually being decent, I just thought it would be fun to
 abandon mundane combat all together. Taking the whip as your primary 
weapon is a good way to do that. Where we hope to make up this loss in 
attack power is with the spells.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even
 with a Charisma of 20, our 1st-level spell DC is still only 16, but all
 of our offensive spells that allow saves fit nicely into two schools, 
which allows us to take the Spell Focus feat for Enchantment and 
Transmutation and gain a +2 to the DC for <i>charm person, sleep, blindness/deafness, hold person, </i>and<i> bestow curse</i>. On a per day basis, here's what we're looking at: <i>charm person</i> or <i>sleep</i> at DC 18 up to 5 times per day, <i>blindness/deafness</i> or <i>hold person</i> at DC 19 up to 4 times per day, and <i>bestow curse</i>
 at DC 20 up to once per day. All of these spells, should they work, 
could really ruin an enemy's day, and with a DC in the 18-20 range, 
they're likely to work quite a bit. I've included two of the <i>summon monster</i> spells because they can be cast from <i>invisibility</i> without breaking the effects of <i>invisibility</i>.
 The big weakness with this character is the inability to deal damage, 
but with a party of fellow adventurers around you and a few summoned 
creatures to help out, it's entirely possible that there's a niche for 
the bard-spellslinger. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 I'd want to play a character like this a few times before deciding for 
certain how playable it is, I can say without a doubt that it's very 
little like the bard-archer listed above, so from the perspective of 
showing off the bard's diversity, I'd have to call this character a 
success.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Roguish Bard</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Unlike
 the dedicated spellcaster, this is a concept I'm fairly familiar with. 
The questions here are exactly how much rogue can you get from your 
bard, and is it worth the effort of finding this out? When trying to 
match up against the rogue, the first things you know you're going to 
give up are the rogue's sneak attack dice. The second thing that goes 
are the rogue's skill points. But is it possible to be within the theme 
of a thief without needing the rogue's class benefits? Let's take a 
look.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Roguish Bard:</b>
 Male elf Bard 7; CR 7; Medium-size humanoid; HD 7d6-7; hp 18; Init +4; 
Spd 30 ft.; AC 20, touch 14, flat-footed 16; Atk +10 melee (1d6+1/18-20,
 <i>+1 frost rapier</i>), or +10 ranged (1d8/x3, masterwork longbow); SQ bardic knowledge +9, bardic music (countersong, <i>fascinate,</i>
 inspire competence, inspire courage) 7/day, elf traits; AL CG; SV Fort 
+1, Ref +9, Will +4; Str 10, Dex 18, Con 8, Int 14, Wis 8, Cha 16. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Skills and Feats:</i>
 Balance +6, Climb +2, Concentration +2, Craft (trapmaking) +9, Disguise

+24, Perform +9, Pick Pocket +6, Search +4, Spot +1, Swim +1, Tumble 
+14, Use Magic Device +4; Dodge, Expertise, Weapon Finesse (rapier).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b>
 The roguish bard may make a bardic knowledge check with a +9 bonus to 
see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable 
people, legendary items, or noteworthy places.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Music:</b> The roguish bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Countersong (Su):</i>
 The roguish bard can counter magical effects that depend on sound by 
making a Perform check for each round of countersong. Any creature 
within 30 feet of the bard who is affected by a sonic or 
language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check 
result in place of his or her saving throw if desired. Countersong lasts
 for 10 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fascinate <i>(Sp):</i>
 The roguish bard can cause a single creature within 90 feet that can 
see and hear him to become fascinated with him. The bard's Perform check
 result is the DC for the opponent's Will save. Any obvious threat 
breaks the effect. Fascination lasts 7 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Competence (Su):</i>
 An ally within 30 feet who can see and hear the roguish bard gets a +2 
competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill for as long as 
he or she can hear the music. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i>
 Allies who can hear the roguish bard receive a +2 morale bonus to saves
 against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus to attack and 
weapon damage rolls The effect lasts for 5 rounds after the ally can no 
longer hear the bard. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Elf Traits:</b> The roguish bard is immune to magic <i>sleep</i>
 spells and effects. He has a +2 racial bonus on saves against 
enchantment spells or effects and low-light vision (can see twice as far
 as a human in low-light conditions). The roguish bard is entitled to a 
Search check when within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door as though 
actively looking for it. He has Martial Weapon Proficiency (composite 
longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, longsword, and rapier) as bonus 
feats. The bard-archer also has a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and 
Search checks (already figured into the statistics given above).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bard Spells Known</b> (3/4/3/1; save DC 13 + spell level; 15% chance of spell failure): 0 -- <i>daze, detect magic, ghost sound, mage hand, open/close, prestidigitation; </i>1st -- <i>charm person, detect secret doors, identify, sleep; </i>2nd -- <i>invisibility, locate object, shatter, silence; </i>3rd -- <i>displacement, gaseous form.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Possessions: </i>Mithral shirt,<i> +1 buckler, +1 frost rapier, </i>masterwork longbow, arrows (50),<i> boots of elvenkind, cloak of elvenkind, gloves of Dexterity </i>(+2)*,<i></i>backpack, belt pouch, caltrops, chalk, musical instruments (2), silk rope (50 feet), 13 gp.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">*Already figured into stats above.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As before, here are the character statistics and the highlights:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>AC:</b> 20 (w/ the option to sacrifice Attack for AC using Expertise).</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Attack:</b> +10 with a rapier, +10 with a longbow.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Damage:</b> 1d6+1.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell DC:</b> 14 for 1st-level spells.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spells:</b><i>Charm person, darkness, detect secret doors, displacement, gaseous form, identify, invisibility, locate object, shatter, sleep.</i></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skills:</b> Hide and Move Silently at +24 each (the cloak and boots definitely help here!), Tumble with a +14, and a bunch of other stuff.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 AC here is good -- a solid 20 that doesn't include the potential bonus 
from using Expertise. In exchange, we're giving up several points of 
damage. With the <i>cloak</i> and <i>boots of elvenkind</i> we pick up 
the ability to sneak just about anywhere, just so long as there's enough
 cover and shadows for us to stay hidden in. Add <i>invisibility</i> and <i>silence</i> to that and sneakiness is all but assured.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 compared to a rogue, the bard with rogue tendencies you see here isn't 
likely to perform the same functions in an adventuring party. He has no 
sneak attack dice, no lockpicking ability, and no way to disarm those 
tricky traps. However, as an outright thief, I think the bard might 
actually be better at sneaking into people's places and stealing their 
stuff. How? Let me show you.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First let's look at the spells <i>invisibility</i> and <i>silence</i>.
 A +24 bonus on a Move Silently roll is fine and good, but even better 
is not having to make a roll at all. While under the effects of <i>silence</i>
 you can't cast further spells, so cast it upon a rock or something that
 you keep in your hand so that you can hurl it out a window or down a 
long hall should you need to be outside of the <i>silence </i>spell's area in a hurry. Next is the spell <i>locate object</i>. Now, cast your <i>locate object</i>
 to locate the nearest trap. You need to be fairly specific about the 
kind of trap, such as a tripwire or pit. The spell can give you advance 
warning of a trap nearby, which might allow you to avoid it. Finally, 
should you encounter a lock you find yourself unable to get through, why
 not <i>shatter</i> it instead? Keep in mind that you have to drop the 
rock to cast the spell, and the spell itself is not exactly the 
sneakiest one around, but sometimes you do what you have to do. Just be 
prepared for your foes to come and find you.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Does
 any of this mean the other classes aren't diverse? No, of course not, 
but it does show that there's a lot of range to the bard class, and it 
might help you see some uses for your bard character that you hadn't 
considered yet. More tweaking could take a bard character further in any
 of these directions, or it could send them off in some other direction 
entirely.</span></p>
