<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last
 time we left off with some ideas for roleplaying the beginning bard, 
but we have some more to cover on that topic, so let's jump right in and
 continue!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>More on Roleplaying</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 it may not be mentioned on your equipment list, every bard character 
has, stuffed into a pocket somewhere, a little note that reads: "Welcome
 in taverns everywhere." For many bards, this note takes the form of a 
lute or other favorite instrument, but the form isn't important. What IS
 important is that bards and taverns go together like all-night gaming 
sessions and Mountain Dew (or other favorite caffeinated beverage). The 
life of your average inhabitant of the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> 
universe is rough, and when she wants to unwind after a hard day of 
doing whatever it is she does, she heads to the local tavern and hopes 
that maybe, just maybe, a traveling minstrel, a teller of tales, a 
musician of incredible skill with stories of heroic adventures and far 
off lands and deeds great and small awaits her. The day a new bard comes
 to town is a big deal, so why not have some fun with it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In many <b>D&amp;D</b>
 towns, the local inn or tavern is a social hub, so your bard should 
make a habit of dropping by as soon as the he enters town to let the 
owner of the establishment know he will be back later to perform. The 
first time a bard does this might not mean much, but if you're lucky 
enough to have your bard return to the same town several times, maybe he
 will start to draw a crowd. Once word of your arrival has spread, make 
the best use of your bard's performance time. If your party has an 
agenda that you can help along, go with that, but even if you have no 
big group goals, there's still a lot you can do with your bard. Sing the
 praises of your fellow adventurers -- they love that. In the sad event 
an adventurer in your party met with an unfortunate end in your recent 
travels, the bard can tell rousing tales of the fallen member's bravery 
and the dramatic story of her heroic death. This keeps the memories of 
old characters alive, and it's likely the player will appreciate it, as 
well. Your bard can also sneak in a few less benevolent acts, too. If 
you don't think the half-orc barbarian is pulling his weight, maybe a 
few choruses of "Song of the Yellow Orc" will motivate him.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 other thing you can have your bard do in the local tavern, in addition 
to performing, is to listen. This is where bardic knowledge comes in.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Bardic Knowledge</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 lifetime spent swapping stories with people in taverns and the few 
chance encounters with other traveling performers leaves a bard with a 
lot of information floating around in his head. With all of that 
information, there's always a chance some of it may actually be useful. A
 bard can make a Bardic Knowledge check, adding his level and 
Intelligence modifier, to determine if he knows some information about a
 topic. The DC for the check varies between 10 and 30, depending on the 
obscurity of the knowledge you're looking for. It's a very simple 
mechanic and has the potential to reveal some interesting facts. It also
 serves as a great way for a DM to introduce subplots or to drop an 
important clue to help a party that's struggling with something. The 
difficulty I find in using this ability is that if the knowledge is 
obscure enough for your bard to need to roll for it, you often don't 
know that you need to ask for it. Here's how I get around that: When 
something interesting comes into conversation -- an event, location, 
important person, whatever -- I'll ask the DM if my character has heard 
any mention of that thing in any songs or stories he has heard over the 
years. If the DM looks uncertain or is thinking about it, I offer to 
roll bardic knowledge as an indicator. Most DMs are fine with that as a 
solution, although it's not exactly what the system intended.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Abilities</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At
 first glance, the ability selection for a bard is pretty simple, and 
the first glance is pretty accurate. Charisma is obviously huge since 
all things related to spells are attached to it. The level of spells the
 bard can cast, the number of spells he knows, the number of spells he 
can cast per day, and the DC to resist those spells are all linked to 
Charisma. In every case that I can think of, Charisma is going to be 
your starting bard's highest ability and, as the game goes on, 
Charisma-increasing items are up near the top of every bard's Christmas 
list.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Close
 behind Charisma in importance is Dexterity. Just as Charisma links to 
spell-related things, Dexterity can relate to all those combat-related 
things. The Dexterity modifier adds directly to AC, which is reason 
enough to get as much as you can, but in addition to that huge benefit, 
Dexterity is also the key ability used to hit in ranged combat, which 
you'll be using all the time if you took my advice last month and had 
your bard focus on archery. Even if you don't have your bard go the 
archery route, the best close-combat weapon on your bard's proficiency 
list is the rapier, and the rapier has the distinction of being the 
largest weapon that your bard can use with the Weapon Finesse feat. The 
Weapon Finesse feat allows you to use your bard's Dexterity modifier, 
instead of your bard's Strength modifier, to determine if your bard hits
 in melee combat. There are two downsides to this: The first is your 
bard will still be using his Strength modifier for damage with a melee 
weapon, and the second is that you can't give a 1st-level bard Weapon 
Finesse since it requires a base attack bonus of +1 and a bard won't get
 that until 2nd level.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Next
 up on the useful abilities list are Intelligence and Constitution. 
Intelligence is good to have because it helps increase the small number 
of skill points your bard gets per level (4 + Intelligence modifier). 
Constitution helps with the bard's small Hit Die (d6). I rate 
Intelligence higher than Constitution because I plan to be in the back 
shooting arrows and because the bard skill selection is pretty wide, and
 I know of several skills that I want to build ranks in.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bringing
 up the rear are Strength and Wisdom. Ranged weapon damage isn't 
increased by a high Strength the way melee damage is, and Wisdom is . . .
 well, it's the stat that gets tanked so you can have a high Charisma 
and Dexterity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Skills</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Skills
 are so much a matter of personal taste and vary so widely based on the 
individual campaign that I'll mention only a few of the universal skill 
choices that I think are important. First of all, take a look at Perform
 since that's the skill bardic music is based on, then pick Gather 
Information for its obvious information-gathering abilities. From there 
you may want to add a few ranks in Use Magic Device, not because I've 
found it to be overly useful but because bard is the only class other 
than rogue that can buy it at all. After adding ranks in those key three
 skills, I like to choose a group of skills associated with whatever 
high ability scores I have that I'd like to focus on and go with those. 
These are either the Charisma-based skills of Bluff, Diplomacy, and 
Disguise, or the Dexterity-based skills of Hide, Move Silently, and 
Tumble. In the unlikely event you find yourself with extra skill points 
after purchasing ranks in these skills, the different Knowledge skills 
are great places to put some ranks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Like
 my bard character, I enjoy a good epic poem, but even by those 
standards, this article is beginning to run a little long. Next time 
we'll get away from this low-level stuff and focus on spells: from 
starting spell selection to spell progression up through the levels.</span></p>
