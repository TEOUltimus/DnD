<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As you read this, it's the beginning of July, the month <b>D&amp;D</b>
 3.5 comes out, but as I write this, it's the end of April, and the big 
question for me is this: What exactly will you know when you read this? 
Why is this important? Here, I'll show you:</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Big News</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b><i>Player's Handbook</i> 3.5 is written the following:</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Gnome Racial Traits<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Favored Class: Bard</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 see? If 3.5 isn't on the shelves yet, and if we haven't released that 
information some other way, that's a pretty big spoiler. If, on the 
other hand, the new <i>Player's Handbook</i> has been out a week, or if one of the 3.5 spoiler articles on the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 website or any of the fan sites has already told you that, well, then 
it's not very interesting. (Well, it might be interesting, but it's not 
new to you.) Such is the joy of writing for the future. Who knows, maybe
 there'll be a fire at the printer's and 3.5 will be delayed 6 months. 
Since there's no way to know, I'll just have to press ahead with the 
idea that you haven't already read the new <i>Player's Handbook</i> and that some, if not all, of this is news to you.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">What's New</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 many have speculated, it's the half-casters, like the bard, that see 
the most changes in 3.5. Given all the possible variants and ideas I've 
seen tossed about on the message boards, fan sites, and email, I don't 
know how many of these changes were expected by most people. I imagine 
that if you gathered all the guesses and requests out there together 
you'd likely find pretty much everything that has been changed listed 
somewhere at least once. Let's start with one that I think everyone 
expected and most people I know have been using for a while now:</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skill Points:</b> 6 + Int modifier per level (with the traditional x 4 at 1st-level, of course).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is a long time in coming and I'm sure everyone appreciates it.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bardic
 music also got an overhaul. It's not the total rewrite I saw suggested 
some places on the Internet, but it has had some expansion and a slight 
mechanic alteration here and there. The bardic music abilities are now 
level-dependent, as well as dependent on ranks in Perform. This doesn't 
change much of anything for the pure bard character, but it does mean 
that you can no longer take just one level in bard and gain all the 
bardic music abilities by simply buying up your Perform ranks 
cross-class (or taking the Cosmopolitan feat and making it in-class). 
Countersong, <i>fascinate,</i> and inspire courage are all back as the 
1st-level bardic music abilities, and every application of bardic music 
received at least some small modification or clarification to its 
effects. Mostly this was just little stuff, like clarifying that using <i>suggestion</i> does not count as a use of the bardic music ability for the day (since you already have to <i>fascinate</i> a target before you can use <i>suggestion</i>),
 and a few slightly larger modifications, like inspire courage, which 
becomes more effective as you rise in bard levels. Inspire greatness, 
however, got a bit larger of a change and three new possible uses for 
bardic music are introduced: <i>song of freedom, </i>inspire heroics,<i></i>and <i>mass suggestion</i>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I
 had one other thing to mention before I move on to spells, which I know
 you're all curious about. A couple of neat things are awaiting you 
under the header "Weapon and Armor Proficiency." First, you don't have 
to pick just one weapon from a small list to be proficient with because 
you get 'em all. The list has been shortened a bit, though; it drops 
longbow and composite longbow. That's okay, though, since elves are 
still proficient in all bows, which raises the question of what gnomes 
are proficient with. The answer: nothing, that's what. Moving on in the 
weapons and armor section there's also this: "a bard can cast bard 
spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane 
spell failure chance." Since very little makes me want to beat my head 
against the table more than losing one of my precious high-level spells 
to spell failure just because I refuse to let my bard run around without
 at least some armor, I was pretty stoked to read that.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Spells</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now for the moment for which you've all been waiting. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Short
 of completely changing the class, the largest changes that can be made 
to the bard are in its spell selection. It's pretty easy to find the 
bard spell list section of my preview copy of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 since it practically glows in the dark with highlighter ink. At a 
glance, the spell selection is more rounded, with a broader range of 
spell types to choose from. I, for one, am very excited about this since
 it allows not only for a deeper, more useful, jack-of-all-trades type 
of character, which I'm very fond of, but it also allows for a wider 
range of different types of bard characters should you choose to 
specialize your bard. I've already written an article about the 
different directions you can take the bard in by focusing on one of 
several possible aspects of the class, and, seeing the 3.5 version of 
the bard, I'm looking forward to trying that again and finding new and 
different aspects of the bard class to explore.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 first thing I noticed when I got into specifics was that the bard has a
 greater number of higher level spells: twenty different 6th-level 
spells are available to choose from. Missing from the spell list is one 
thing I never thought was appropriate, which was the tendency toward 
illusion spells at the higher levels (which now becomes somewhat ironic 
when you think about the whole gnome thing). In fact, when I look for a 
theme among the spells available to the bard, I now see spells like <i>shout, greater shout, </i>my old favorites <i>shatter </i>and <i>sound burst</i>, along with <i>sculpt sound, song of discord, </i>and <i>sympathetic vibration</i>. Sound manipulation and sonic damage all over the place -- what could be more appropriate for a bard?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On
 the other side of the coin, we did lose some stuff. Here's an actual 
quote from me as I skimmed the new spell list for the first time, "Ack! 
My <i>mage armor</i>, where's my <i>mage armor</i>? And <i>greater magic weapon</i> . . . not <i>greater magic weapon</i>!"
 Yes, these staples are gone, but you have to look at that as a good 
thing, since it forces you to look elsewhere and be creative, and being 
creative is always a good thing. Also, I guess we know now why bards 
don't suffer arcane spell failure for light armor any more. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In a general sense, the bard has lost most, if not all, of its direct strength and damage boosting spells (<i>bull's strength, magic weapon, greater magic weapon, keen edge</i>)
 but has gained a wide variety of different types of spells in return, 
including some direct damage sonic spells and some other boost type 
spells such as <i>rage</i> and <i>good hope</i>. <i>Wind wall</i> and <i>gust of wind</i> are gone, so my dreams of a "wind" themed bard are gone, if indeed I ever had any. <i>Undetectable alignment</i> has moved down to 1st level, while <i>see invisibility</i> and <i>daylight</i> have moved up from 2nd to 3rd level, and bards have gained the option to <i>speak with animals</i> and <i>speak with plants</i> as 3rd- and 4th-level spells, respectively. You might find <i>disguise self</i> handy as a 1st-level spell, or <i>alter self</i> at 2nd level, or you just may prefer <i>glibness</i>
 in the spell form instead of potion, and you can find this available as
 a 3rd-level spell. The 2nd-level spell list added four new buffs: <i>eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, heroism, </i>and<i> rage</i>, while at 6th-level you'll see <i>Otto's irresistible dance</i>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 best part is that even with all this, there's still plenty left for you
 to find for yourself when you get the book. The new bard looks like it 
will continue to be the "second best at everything, first best at 
nothing" class that we've become accustomed to, but I think we're going 
to see that the larger spell selection and new bardic music effects 
allow the bard to be the second best at many more things than before. 
This expands on the idea of a class that has few direct weaknesses and 
who can exploit the weakness in a wide range of opponents. It also looks
 like there's going to be a bard buff machine concept coming in the near
 future, with more ways to add +1 and +2 on attacks, saves, skill 
checks, and abilities than ever before. Even if you're not interested in
 playing a bard, you may find a bard would make a good selection for 
your Leadership feat -- smells like a future article coming on.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Erik Olsen thinks that far and away the best improvement in the 3.5 <b>D&amp;D</b>
 is that they started to list terms like "Greater," and "Lesser" as 
descriptors after the main spell name. No longer will you need to look 
under "L" for <i>lesser planar binding</i>, under "P" for <i>planar binding, </i>or under "G" for <i>greater planar binding</i>. Now they're listed together as "<i>planar binding,</i>" "<i>planar binding, lesser</i>," and "<i>planar binding, greater</i>."</span></p>
