A dragonborn or kobold, from <i>Races of the Dragon</i>; a minotaur, from <i>Savage Species</i>; or a <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fc/20060728a">ambush drake</a>,
 from our Creature Incarnation series? Feral races make for exceptional 
warriors--and become even more ferocious when taking on the Thayan 
gladiator prestige class, as its designer, Wil Upchurch, explains.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Thayan gladiator prestige class from <i>Champions of Ruin</i>
 turns an already fearsome creature into a more lethal conveyor of 
death. They hone their ability to fight with their natural weapons, 
eventually gaining extraordinary powers thanks to the arcane rituals of 
their masters. They alternately chafe against the bonds that force them 
to fight, and revel in the glory and adulation they win from 
appreciative crowds. When a Thayan gladiator is unleashed on the world 
at large, his presence causes fear and awe wherever he appears.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Playing a character race with a natural attack? In the 
following article, we examine the creation of the Thayan gladiator, a 
powerful prestige class for any such race to take on.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Development Notes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When I was asked to write for <i>Champions of Ruin</i>, I
 jumped at the chance because I saw the opportunity to look at the 
Forgotten Realms as it had never been looked at before--through the eyes
 of evil player characters. Sure, there had been books on evil in the 
Realms (i.e., <i>Lords of Darkness</i>) and books about evil NPCs (<i>Villains' Lorebook</i>), but they weren't exactly geared toward allowing players to cause mayhem across the continent.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When I began to think about prestige classes for <i>Champions of Ruin</i>,
 I wanted to differentiate them from something you might find in a book 
for typically heroic PCs. One concept that arose out of my brainstorming
 was that of a powerful monstrous fighter that utilized natural weaponry
 to shred his foes. If you judge by recommended alignment, there aren't 
all that many cool monstrous humanoids you can play if you want to be 
heroic, and even the good or neutral ones certainly face a social 
disadvantage in most areas of Faerun. Evil, however, opens up a 
menagerie of options that has me rubbing my hands together gleefully 
whenever I think about it. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>From Concept to Execution</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2009-20%20-%20Thayan%20Gladiator_files/dx0919prc_redwizard.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="199" width="200">I
 had the basic idea in hand, but how was I going to make it come alive 
into an exciting class? More importantly, how was I going to tie it 
explicitly into the Realms? I knew I wanted the class to grant the 
character's main natural weapon extraordinary abilities. Minotaurs with 
flaming horns? Check. Lizardmen with blindingly fast talon strikes? Heck
 yes! Since this PrC's focus was going to be purely offensive, and 
offense does no good if you can't survive, I threw in some bonuses to 
natural armor to go along with superlative hit die to make sure these 
gladiators could survive in constant melee.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Thayan gladiator's abilities basically come from two
 sources: his training as a gladiator, and the evolution of his body's 
natural gifts. The first source presented no inherent problems (beyond 
it possibly being difficult to justify that training in the middle of a 
campaign), but I also wanted the latter to have some justification. I 
don't like spontaneous magical transformations as a result of class 
levels, so I needed this to be the result of something--transformative 
draughts, prayers and sacrifice to elder spirits, or maybe even the 
effects of a magical location. I found an answer in the Red Wizards of 
Thay that fit both thematically and was very appropriate for the 
setting. Let's look at how and why the Thay connection works so well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thay is one of the few slaveholding regions in Faerun.</li>
<li>Thay is ruled by and populated heavily by wizards.</li>
<li>Thay features a diverse array of humanoids, most of whom are slaves.</li>
<li>Being openly evil doesn't really disadvantage you in Thay.</li>
<li>The politics of the Red Wizards and Tharchions are so intense that 
they need alternative ways of establishing dominance other than outright
 force.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This last was important in developing the class's background--<i>why</i>
 exactly would the Thayans develop a ritual for transforming their 
slaves in this manner? Ego, greed, political and social 
stratification... right up the alley of your average Thayan power 
player. Of course, the Zulkir of Transmutation wasn't averse to growing 
his power and wealth by creating the ritual that gives the gladiators 
their abilities.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Becoming a Thayan Gladiator</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This prestige class is perfect for players who want to 
be in the middle of the action all the time, every time. You're tough, 
potent, and have flashy abilities that draw attention to your character.
 You're the party's meat grinder, and there's nothing you love better 
than wading into a sea of enemies to spill their blood. Here are the 
prerequisites for becoming a Thayan gladiator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evil alignment</li>
<li>Base attack bonus +5</li>
<li>At least one natural weapon</li>
<li>Feats: Toughness, Weapon Focus (any natural weapon)</li>
<li>You must undergo a ritual developed by the Zulkir of Transmutation</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">In order to enter this prestige class, you must focus on
 combat training and readiness, with an emphasis on one of your natural 
weapons. This natural weapon is the one that will be enhanced by the 
Zulkir's ritual. It might seem like barbarians are the best route to get
 the prerequisites taken care of, and a strong argument could be made 
that their rage and fast movement abilities complement the Thayan 
gladiator's melee prowess quite well. But, don't overlook the fighter as
 a viable alternative. The bonus fighter feats you gain make it less 
burdensome to meet the Thayan gladiator's prerequisites, and your base 
attack progresses at the same quick rate. Perhaps most importantly, 
fighters wear heavy armor, which can significantly increase your 
survivability rate against tough or numerous opponents. As a ranger, you
 may also be interested in the path of the Thayan gladiator. You can use
 your stealth and high Wisdom to take full advantage of your ability to 
study your opponents, and then use your enhancements to neutralize 
enemies before the alarm can be raised.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, you've still got to worry about how you're 
going to find someone to sponsor you for the ritual that causes your 
body to transform. Not to mention the fact that you, as a Thayan 
gladiator, are a slave to one of Thay's elite politicians or Red 
Wizards. Some might be willing to trade your temporary services for 
access to the ritual, or allow you to buy partial freedom for a certain 
amount of gold. You may be asked or allowed to leave for other reasons 
as well, but the specter of your former master will never quite leave 
you. He can reenter your life at any time, and complicate matters for 
yourself and those with whom you travel.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Playing a Thayan Gladiator</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">People who play effective Thayan gladiators usually keep the following in mind:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Do What You Do Best</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You have a high base attack bonus, great hit dice, and a
 savage melee weapon that can never be taken from you... so get out 
there and use them! Look for opportunities to join melee combat whenever
 possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Know Your Limitations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Spellcasters can be your bane, thanks to your weak 
Reflex and Will saves, so avoid direct confrontations with them if 
possible. You aren't going to have many skill points to spend, so use 
them wisely (movement skills such as Climb and Jump are your most 
effective choices, especially to offset the penalties for wearing 
armor).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Be Aggressive but Selective</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Your primary asset is your ferocious melee ability, no 
doubt about it, but you're far from invulnerable. Traps that 
incapacitate you without relying on damage, such as pits, can take you 
out of combat long enough for the rest of your party to be taken apart. 
Clever magic-using opponents will also try to neutralize physical 
threats with area and mind-affecting spells, so making yourself a big 
target right out of the gate can do more harm than good. The same can be
 said for advertising obvious magical enhancements such as <i>flaming</i> or <i>shock</i>. It's best to let opponents underestimate you (if that's possible) for as long as possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once you engage in combat, however, let nothing stop you
 from wreaking havoc in the ranks of your enemies. You've got plenty of 
hit points to withstand front-line engagement, probably more effectively
 than anyone you're adventuring with, and in your case the best defense 
is definitely a good offense.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even though you're a mighty force, it's not always 
wisest for you to try to take on the most powerful opponent by yourself 
(especially if that opponent is a spellcaster). You <i>do</i> have 
friends, after all, and they can hold their own as well. In large 
encounters, it's sometimes more beneficial if you wade into a group of 
lesser monsters or minions, keeping them off your companions, who can 
then gang up on a more powerful foe. Being in the midst of minions also 
protects you against area attacks (from all but the most dastardly of 
villains), and to an extent ranged attacks as well, letting you fight 
your enemies on your own terms.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Some Key Equipment</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Thayan gladiators pride themselves on using their bodies
 to dispatch opponents, but that doesn't mean they can overlook their 
equipment entirely. Here are a few things to keep in mind when spending 
your hard-earned gold:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Defense First: </b>Although at higher levels it's 
good to supplement your natural weapon with a powerful melee 
alternative, you should be thinking primarily about how to stay in 
combat longer. If you wear armor, which you should, then you should add 
as many enhancement bonuses as you can afford. And choose a <i>cloak of resistance</i> over something like a <i>cloak of displacement</i>... you're more worried about spells and special abilities taking you out of the fight than damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mobility is Key:</b> Items that aid you in getting to
 the battlefield and then maneuvering around it will help you utilize 
your strengths. Try to find <i>boots of striding and springing</i> and a <i>ring of freedom of movement</i>, and keep a <i>potion of fly</i>
 on your belt for getting into and out of really tricky situations. 
Anything that helps you hide or otherwise gain surprise, such as shadow 
armor or <i>potions of invisibility</i>, is also a handy addition to your arsenal.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Backup Melee Weapon:</b> This would be most folks' 
primary weapon, but you've got something better. This might be the 
weapon you used before becoming a Thayan gladiator. Even though it would
 be stylish to match your weapon's special qualities to those of your 
natural weapon, it makes more sense to use your backup weapon to fill in
 the gap (perhaps making it a <i>ghost touch</i> weapon or giving it elemental damage that your natural weapon doesn't have).</p>
