<p align="LEFT">The <i>PHB II</i> introduced the knight, a champion of 
the battlefield, effective in heavy armor and able to challenge the 
field's strongest opponent. Looking for these strengths in an 
evil-aligned character? <i>Champions of Ruin</i>'s vengeance knight may just be the way to go--and its designer, Wil Upchurch, explains how.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The vengeance knight prestige class from <i>Champions of Ruin</i>
 makes an already effective fighter into a brutal killing machine. They 
hunt their master's enemies relentlessly and pursue opponents in 
personal combat until one or the other no longer breathes the same air. 
The vengeance knight's single-mindedness can be his greatest strength, 
but it can also be a glaring liability to a party whose goals diverge 
too far from the task to which he has been set.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the following article, we examine the genesis of the 
vengeance knight, and offer strategy for effective adopting this 
prestige class.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Development Notes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2010-17%20-%20Vengeance%20Knight_files/prc_vengeanceknight.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="285" width="240">As I said in my last article, <i>Champions of Ruin</i>
 gave me the opportunity to view the Realms through the lens of evil 
player characters, rather than within the traditional heroic 
PC/villainous NPC paradigm. It's fun (and feels slightly devious after 
all these years of having my PCs protect the Realms) to give players the
 tools to try and dominate Faerun, to crush all good and civilized 
opposition, and to clear the way of any do-gooders that have plans to 
get in their way.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When you conjure heroic images, one of the most powerful
 archetypes is that of the knight, dressed in full armor defending the 
weak and helpless against great evils no matter the peril. Of course, 
the reverse is the black knight, a selfish bully who uses his strength 
and training to dominate all those around him. In between those two 
extremes lies a wealth of interpretations and gradations of the knight's
 code. You've got the hedge knight, a wanderer who protects travelers 
for money; the country knight who protects and leads his home region out
 of a sense of duty; or the crusading knight, a landed servant of the 
king who fights abroad for gold and glory.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since knights are archetypal, I knew I wanted to include some variation in <i>Champions of Ruin</i>.
 After all, just because the players will be taking on anti-heroic or 
even villainous roles doesn't mean they're not going to be driven by the
 same core desires. Some players enjoy tying their character to an 
ideology, organization, or strong leader--something greater than 
themselves that they exalt by adventuring and acting upon their 
principles.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>From Concept to Execution</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> already presented <b>D&amp;D</b>'s
 version of the black knight in the blackguard, and I didn't want to 
step on its toes. An anti-heroic hedge knight was not that interesting a
 concept, and a bit too generic for a Forgotten Realms book, so I shied 
away from that route. I finally decided to tie the knight to an 
organization, so that he'd have somewhere from which to derive his code 
of behavior. I've always loved the Lands of Intrigue, and felt like they
 were getting a bit shortchanged with the new edition, so I looked there
 for inspiration--and found the Knights of the Shield. A group like 
that, with its long-ranging mercantile interests and powerful rivals 
(the Rundeen, the Shadow Thieves, and others), could definitely use some
 independent enforcers that worked alone and ranged out all over the 
Knights' territory.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once again, the idea was formed, but a prestige class's 
abilities are of equal importance to its background and role. How could I
 make this class knightly, flavorful, and innovative? I really had two 
things in mind when I started determining the vengeance knight's 
abilities: he should excel at things that are traditionally knightly, 
and he should be able to stand on his own against anything his employers
 sent him up against. The latter would prove especially problematic, 
since it's always difficult to prepare a combat class to fully stand 
against supernatural and magical threats.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alleviating the difficulties of wearing heavy armor 
seemed a no-brainer to me, and was a stark way to mechanically link the 
class to its theme. Plus, I always wondered why there hadn't been a 
"heavy armor specialist" class presented before... so I decided to add 
one to the mix (although, named aptly enough, the <i>PHB II</i>'s knight class tackles this heavy armor role as well).</p>
<p align="LEFT">After that, I focused on the vengeance knight's 
single-mindedness. Once they are set to a task, generally threatening or
 enacting physical violence on an enemy or debtor, they carry it out 
with dogged determination. I really wanted the notion that you might be a
 vengeance knight's target to carry with it a certain amount of fear and
 inevitability. The bringer of vengeance and counterstrike abilities are
 interesting because they reward the vengeance knight that picks (or is 
given) a target and sticks to that foe until it is dead, or at least 
properly intimidated.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Finally, in order to help them guard against magical 
domination and firepower, I gave the class the arcane backlash ability. 
Sure, it doesn't do that much damage, but it's a passive ability that's 
always functioning, and serves to put any opposition mage on 
notice--you're messing with someone who's soon going to turn his 
attention to <i>you</i>. As an intimidating effect, I thought it met this purpose well.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Becoming a Vengeance Knight</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The vengeance knight is geared toward those players that
 want to feel like their characters are a part of the larger world, or 
who want their characters to be individualistic, goal-driven, and 
governed by a code or directive from above. You help keep your party's 
focus on the task at hand, and you raise their status (or at least that 
status born of fear) by your very presence. Here are the prerequisites 
for becoming a vengeance knight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lawful evil, lawful neutral, or neutral evil alignment</li>
<li>Base attack bonus +5</li>
<li>Intimidate 6 ranks, Ride 4 ranks, Sense Motive 2 ranks</li>
<li>Feats: Iron Will, Weapon Focus (any sword)</li>
<li>Heavy armor and shield proficiency</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This class forces you to at least focus some combat 
training with a sword, which is expected to be your primary weapon. You 
also have to be proficient with the armor and shield that you'll learn 
how to utilize better than others with similar training. Fighters are 
most commonly recruited by the Knights of the Shield, since they 
naturally fit most of the class's requirements, but ex-paladins and even
 blackguards seeking a new master have been known to take up the group's
 standard. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Playing a Classy Vengeance Knight</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2010-17%20-%20Vengeance%20Knight_files/prc_vengeanceknight2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="330" width="240">People who play great vengeance knights usually keep the following in mind:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Do What You Do Best</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Your singular focus is a great strength... although it 
can also get you in trouble when you're outmatched but compelled to 
fight on. Look for opportunities to take advantage of your increased 
mobility in your armor. Attack on horseback when possible, or feign the 
weaknesses of a heavily armored opponent until your target overextends 
himself.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Know Your Limitations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Even though your saving throws are weak against most 
spells, mages don't worry you as much as other fighters because of your 
arcane backlash ability, which deters them from attempting too many 
targeted spells. Still, you should always have a backup plan in case 
your target has too many friends to deal with. Don't get overconfident 
in your armor, either--you're still going to be somewhat impaired next 
to someone in lighter or no armor. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Don't Lose Focus</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Some of your best abilities kick in when you're fighting
 one opponent specifically, especially if it's a target you've been 
given by the Knights of the Shield or one of your temporary employers. 
Even if you don't have a specific target, you should look for the most 
powerful creature on the battlefield and attempt to isolate it in single
 combat (another comparative point to <i>PHB II</i>'s knight). That 
makes it more likely that your counterstrike ability will kick in, 
allowing you to maximize your damage-dealing capability each round. 
You've likely got the best armor class in your party, anyway, so why not
 utilize it by occupying a major threat while they deal with any other 
threats that might distract you from your target.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Some Key Equipment</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Vengeance knights must remain equipped with the best 
armor, shield, and sword that money can buy. Since they never know what 
kind of adversary they'll be asked to face next, they should also keep a
 variety of other magic and equipment around so they're ever prepared. 
Here are a few things to keep in mind when stocking up:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Armor All: </b>Since you'll be in armor almost all of
 the time, it makes sense to pour as much into it as possible. 
Enhancement bonuses are important, but at the upper end it makes more 
sense to spend your money adding special abilities to the armor instead.
 After all, you're getting less benefit as a ratio from enhancement 
bonuses than armors with lower bonuses to AC. <i>Slick</i> armor will help you avoid one of the most effective ways to neutralize you--grappling. <i>Invulnerability</i> can help you build the image of being a juggernaut, and <i>fortification</i> lessens the chances of you being taken out of a fight with a lucky blow.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Don't forget your shield, either. Adding <i>bashing</i> to your shield synergizes well with the Improved Shield Bash feat, while <i>dancing</i>
 might free you up to use a larger sword in both hands to deal even 
greater damage. Enhancement bonuses to your shield also increase your AC
 at a cheaper rate than adding more to your armor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Potions, Potions, Potions:</b> Because you're going 
to need different abilities to deal with different targets--and your 
employers don't really care what dangers you face, just that you face 
them--the best way to stay prepared is by keeping a variety of potions 
on hand (besides, a masterwork potion belt is a must-have for front-line
 fighters anyway). Defensive potions such as <i>shield of faith</i> are good, while some potions such as <i>enlarge person</i> can help you intimidate your foes. <i>Blur</i> and <i>displacement</i> will help you survive, while <i>haste</i> and <i>heroism</i> can make you even more fearsome in melee combat. A variety of healing and effect removal (<i>remove blindness/deafness, neutralize poison, remove curse</i>, etc.) can help you deal with unexpected setbacks.</p>
