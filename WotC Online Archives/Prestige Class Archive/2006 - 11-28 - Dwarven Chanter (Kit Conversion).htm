 once again for this week's column (see also Halfling Whistler), as well
 as spicing up my favorite demihuman race of all time—dwarves. I always 
thought there should be a special role for dwarven bards in the game, 
because I see them as a deeply spiritual race whose natural environment 
has great acoustic potential. The dwarven chanter is a fascinating 
archetype, but the question on the table: can you make a playable 
character based around chanting and endurance-based abilities? Well, 
that's what I'm here to find out.</p>
<p>As always, feel free to leave feedback over on the message boards, or to me directly via email at <a href="mailto:magewebmaster@yahoo.com">magewebmaster@yahoo.com</a>.
 Also, let me know which kits, classes, and prestige classes from 
earlier editions of the game you'd like to see me take on for an update.
 Now, what's that deep droning sound I hear coming down the hall...?</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Dwarven Chanter</b></p>
<p>The legendary power of the dwarven chanters has been the source of 
much scholarly and religious speculation. Many attribute the very 
success of the dwarven race to this special gift. Ancient dwarven lore 
speaks of chanters who led their people through the cavernous trails for
 weeks at a time, allowing them to outpace enemies who would have surely
 destroyed them. Other tales speak of incredible mining expeditions that
 returned with five times the yield thought possible, made possible by 
employing chanters with their mining groups.</p>
<p>Chanters work as foremen, clergy, advisors, and military personnel. 
Wherever they go, chanters are able to bring aid and prosperity with 
them, and no large dwarven army or community is without several of these
 powerful allies. Some chanters choose to take up the adventuring life, 
often to spread the word of their gods or assert the power and relevancy
 of the dwarven race. Many were adventurers before they were called to 
this path and are simply continuing their journeys, albeit with newfound
 abilities and powers far surpassing what they had achieved before.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Becoming a Dwarven Chanter</b></p>
<p><b>Entry Requirements:</b> dwarf; Constitution 13; Concentration 8 
ranks, Perform 8 ranks (chant, percussion); Great Fortitude; bardic 
music class ability.</p>

<p><b>Class Skills (6 + Int modifier per level):</b> Appraise, Balance, 
Bluff, Climb, Concentration, Craft, Decipher Script, Diplomacy, 
Disguise, Escape Artist, Gather Information, Hide, Jump, Knowledge (all 
skills, taken individually), Listen, Move Silently, Perform, Profession,
 Sense Motive, Speak Language, Spellcraft, Survival, and Use Magic 
Device.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<p>As they advance in level, dwarven chanters grow stronger and sturdier
 as the tones of their chants penetrate the core of their being.</p>
<p><b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a chanter gains new spells per 
day and spells known (if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in
 a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige 
class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of
 that class would have gained. If he had more than one spellcasting 
class before becoming a chanter, he must decide to which class to add 
each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells 
known.</p>
<p><b>Chanting: </b>A chanter uses percussion and rhythmic vocalizations
 to produce magical effects. Chanting follows the same rules as bardic 
music (see page 29 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Each use of 
chanting costs one daily use of bardic music to activate. Dwarven 
chanter levels stack with bard levels for purposes of determining the 
number of daily uses of bardic music and chanting.</p>
<p><i>Timing Chant (Su):</i> A chanter with 8 or more ranks in a Perform
 skill can use his rhythmic chanting to aid laborers in tedious, 
repetitive work. The four most common timing chants are the Miner's 
Song, the Forger's Steel, the Marching Tune, and the Labor Song. In 
order to initiate a timing chant, the chanter must chant for a full 
minute while accompanying himself on a percussion instrument. During 
this time, all who wish to be affected must join the chant and continue 
to accompany the chanter for the duration of the effect.</p>
<p>The effect of this chanting is to increase the speed and production 
capabilities of the affected individuals. A chanter confers a +2 bonus 
per class level to any checks related to the activity at hand. A 
military unit might gain a bonus on Constitution checks on a forced 
march, or a group of miners might receive a bonus to their Profession 
checks to determine the value of their work.</p>
<p>The timing chant is not without a physical toll for those involved, 
however. At the beginning of each new hour, the chanter must make a 
Perform check (DC 10 + number of hours worked). If successful, he 
continues to inspire his fellows. If he fails his check, however, the 
chant falters. Anyone affected by the timing chant (including the 
chanter) must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 5 + number of hours 
worked) or be forced to stop whatever he is doing and rest as if the 
timing chant had ended (see below). The chanter may continue the chant 
with a DC 20 Perform check, and all who succeeded on their Fortitude 
saves can continue their task; if he fails, the timing chant ends 
immediately.</p>
<p>At the end of a timing chant, all affected individuals are dazed 
until they rest completely for one hour per hour worked. No magical 
healing or abilities such as the soothing chant will reduce the amount 
of time needed to shake off the effects of a timing chant.</p>
<p><i>Soothing Chant (Su):</i> A chanter of at least 2nd level with 10 
or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his chanting to calm and relax 
his comrades, speeding the natural healing process.</p>
<p>To activate this ability, the chanter must chant for one full hour 
and be within 60 feet of any character that he wishes to affect. 
Characters under the influence of a soothing chant may not walk around, 
memorize spells, heal themselves, eat, or perform any activity other 
than rest; otherwise they lose the benefits of the chant.</p>
<p>At the end of the chant, beings affected by the soothing chant 
recover one hit point per hit die and recover all nonlethal damage. 
Also, any exhausted, fatigued, or nauseated characters are relieved of 
those conditions. All Heal checks made within 10 minutes of the end of a
 soothing chant gain a +2 circumstance bonus.</p>
<p><i>War Chant (Su):</i> A chanter of at least 3rd level with 11 or 
more ranks in a Perform skill can inspire his allies and demoralize his 
foes by leading a fearsome chant in combat. Similar to the bard's 
inspire courage ability, a war chant not only provides bonuses to his 
allies but also imposes penalties on his enemies due to the fearsome 
effect of the chant. Allies of the chanter must participate in the chant
 and be able to hear the chanter to be affected; enemies must only be 
able to hear the chanting.</p>
<p>Affected allies gain a +1 bonus morale bonus on attack rolls, damage 
rolls, and saving throws against charm and fear effects. Enemies suffer a
 –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The war chant lasts as long as 
the chanter maintains his song, during which time he may fight but 
cannot cast spells, or activate magic items by spell completion or 
command word.</p>
<p><i>Healing Chant (Su):</i> A chanter of at least 8th level with 16 or
 more ranks in a Perform skill can use his rhythmic song as a method for
 biofeedback. By attuning his chant to the natural rhythms of his body, 
he stimulates his body to hear damage very quickly.</p>
<p>It is a full round action to initiate the healing chant, which can be
 sustained until the chanter is at full hit points, at which time it 
fails. During the healing chant, the character has fast healing 1.</p>
<p><i>Dwarf Lord's Wrath (Su):</i> A chanter of 10th level with 18 or 
more ranks in a Perform skill can channel the power of the earth itself 
by vocalizing the natural vibrations of the land around him.</p>
<p>He must be in contact with the earth for five consecutive rounds 
while he chants this powerful song, and if he takes damage during this 
time he must make a Concentration check as if casting a spell. After the
 5th round, the chanter channels the power he's summoned to shake the 
foundations of any structure in contact with the earth. </p>
<p>During each round that the chant continues, to a maximum number of 
rounds equal to his Constitution score, the chanter may deal 10d6 points
 of damage to one natural or constructed structure within 500 feet. This
 may include trees, a mountain, a castle, a building, or any other such 
structure in contact with the ground. Obviously the chanter will not be 
able to topple a mountain, but he may deal it enough damage to allow 
entry into a formerly blocked passage, or create a massive cave-in to 
impede some subterranean horror. He may shift targets as often as he 
likes as a full-round action as long as the chant remains unbroken.</p>
<p>Other than changing targets, the chanter may perform no action other than moving his base speed each round.</p>
<p><b>Endurance: </b>At 2nd level, the chanter gains Endurance as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><b>Counter Chant (Su): </b>At 4th level, the chanter gains the 
ability to "attack" existing spells. By performing a powerful counter 
chant, the chanter can temporarily suspend magical effects. This works 
exactly as if the character was casting <i>dispel magic</i>, except that
 it does not actually dispel the effects on a successful level check, it
 merely suspends them for as long as he continues to chant. The chanter 
can only attempt this once per magical effect. Note that it is a 
standard action to continue the counter chant each round.</p>
<p>Each use of counter chant takes one daily use of bardic music to activate.</p>
<p><b>Die Hard: </b>At 6th level, the chanter gains Die Hard as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><b>Continuous Spellcasting (Ex): </b>At 5th level, the chanter is 
able to boost his concentration by focusing his mind on his song, thus 
ignoring distractions while spellcasting.</p>
<p>While he is reciting this special song, the chanter need not make 
additional Concentration checks when casting spells for the duration of 
the chant. In addition, the chant acts as the verbal component of any 
spell he casts for its duration.</p>
<p>The chanter begins this chant by making a DC 15 Concentration check 
as a standard action; he is able to maintain incredible focus for one 
round per point by which he succeeds on this check.</p>
<p><b>Trance:</b> At 7th level, the chanter learns to focus his mind so 
keenly on one task that he can perform the task indefinitely. After 10 
minutes of uninterrupted meditation, the chanter shuts down all mental 
and physical functions that aren't necessary for the task at hand. At 
this point the chanter will begin the set activity (marching, mining, 
studying, combat, etc.) until a preset condition occurs. For instance, 
the chanter may have entered a trance to "read until I have read every 
book in the library."</p>
<p>Trances are never entered lightly, however, because they present a 
danger to the chanter. The chanter does not eat, drink, or sleep during 
the trance, straining his body to endure the lack of these vital 
functions. For every four hours that go by, the chanter must make a 
Fortitude save (DC 15 + number of previous saves). On a failure, he 
takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A character brought to 0 
Constitution in this way dies immediately. A character may not 
voluntarily end a trance until the preset condition occurs.</p>
