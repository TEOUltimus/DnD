<p><i>Kaavel stood quietly as the hunting party of orcs stormed past the
 tree he stood behind. They almost caught the swiftblade by surprise 
before he was able to call upon the one spell that bore him through 
every challenge. In an instant, the entire world slowed as if mired in a
 thick morass. The orcs in front of him moved at a fraction of their 
normal speed. The swiftblade unsheathed his elegant rapier and steeled 
himself for the grisly task that followed. In truth, Kaavel enjoyed this
 part more than he ever admitted. They were orcs, after all, and 
deserved to be treated like vermin.</i></p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#f2f2f2" width="300" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>The following prestige class offers new material in conjunction with the release of <i>Complete Mage</i>.
 Please bear in mind, to quote the DMG pg. 176 -- "Prestige classes are

tightly limit the prestige classes available in your campaign." If

<p>While sorcerers and wizards consider <i>haste</i> one of many spells in their repertoire, swiftblades covet <i>haste</i>
 above all others. As a swiftblade, your arcane-assisted speed combined 
with melee skill can turn your first strike into a deadly assault. 
Swiftblades discover unconventional ways to utilize the <i>haste</i> 
spell, permanently augmenting their speed and fusing complimentary spell
 effects into each casting. In a very real sense, swiftblades bond to 
their chosen spell until the two become immutable. </p>
<h4>Becoming a Swiftblade</h4>
<p>Bards, sorcerers, and wizards are the three most obvious candidates 
for swiftblades. Bards can easily fulfill the martial weapon proficiency
 requirement, but sorcerers and wizards do not share their expertise. 
Elf candidates are naturally proficient with racial martial weapons and 
human candidates can take Martial Weapon Proficiency with their extra 
feat to avoid losing a level of spellcasting. A sorcerer or wizard might
 otherwise multiclass into a warrior class for one level. </p>
<p>Besides their spellcasting ability score, Dexterity is the second 
most important attribute for swiftblades. It allows them to avoid blows 
and potentially strike first in combat. Strength and Constitution are 
also important to swiftblades, who are largely melee characters. Not 
having the resilience of pure warriors, Tumble is an ideal skill choice 
for swiftblades to avoid attacks of opportunity. </p>
<p><b>Entry Requirements</b></p>
<p><b>Base Attack Bonus: </b>+3.<br><b>Skills: </b>Concentration 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks.<br><b>Spellcasting: </b>Ability to cast <i><i>haste</i></i>.<br><b>Feats: </b>Dodge, Mobility.<br><b>Weapon Proficiency: </b>Must be proficient with at least one martial weapon.<br><b>Special: </b>Must have spent the entire previous level using all 3rd level spell slots to exclusively cast <i><i>haste</i></i>.</p>

<p><b>Class Skills </b>(4 + Int modifier per level) -- Balance, Craft, 
Concentration, Gather Information, Jump, Knowledge (arcana), Listen, 
Profession, Spot, Spellcraft, Swim, Tumble. </p>
<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p>As they advance in level, swiftblades gain increased spellcasting 
abilities, heightened speed, and unparalleled understanding of the <i>haste</i> spell. They eventually learn how to subsume the <i>haste</i> spell in higher level spell slots to powerful effect. </p>
<p><b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level indicated on the swiftblade table,
 you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells
 known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane 
spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige 
class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of 
that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane 
spellcasting class before becoming a swiftblade, they must decide which 
class gains each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, 
caster level, and spells known. </p>
<p><b>Spring Attack:</b> Beginning at 1st level, you gain Spring Attack (see page 100 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>) as a bonus feat. If you already have Spring Attack, choose a different feat for which you do meet the prerequisites. </p>
<p><b>Swift Surge (Ex):</b> Your body is augmented with the residual energy of previous <i>haste</i>
 castings. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to 
AC and Reflex saves. At 7th level, these bonuses increase to +2. At 4th 
level, you gain a +10 foot enhancement bonus to all of your modes of 
movement and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage during any round in 
which you move at least 10 feet. At 10th level, this bonus increases to 
+20 feet and an extra 2d6 points of damage during any round in which you
 move at least 20 feet. These bonuses stack with the bonuses gained from
 the <i>haste</i> spell and skirmish ability. </p>
<p><b>Blurred Alacrity (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, your understanding of the <i>haste</i> spell makes you difficult to target with melee and ranged attacks. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i>
 spell that you cast yourself, you gain concealment (20% miss chance). 
This miss chance increases by +10% at 3rd, 4th, and 5th level. The 
effect of this ability does not stack with <i>blur, displacement</i>, or similar spell effects. </p>
<p><b>Sudden Casting (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, you learn how to seamlessly cast the <i>haste</i> spell. You can cast <i>haste</i>
 as a free action once per round, as if augmented by the Quicken Spell 
metamagic feat, but without using up higher-level spell slots. </p>
<p><b>Arcane Reflexes (Ex):</b> At 4th level, you infuse the energy of previous <i>haste</i>
 castings into your natural reaction time. You receive a competence 
bonus on initiative rolls equal to your arcane spellcasting ability 
modifier. </p>
<p><b>Evasive Celerity (Ex):</b> At 5th level, your knowledge of the <i>haste</i> spell makes you difficult to target with spells. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i>
 spell that you cast yourself, individually targeted spells have a 20% 
chance of failing against you. This spell failure chance increases by 
+10% at 6th, 7th, and 8th level. The effect of this ability does not 
stack with <i>blink </i>or similar spell effects. </p>
<p><b>Fortified Hustle (Ex):</b> At 6th level, you learn how to intuitively absorb the <i>haste</i> spell into your body. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i>
 spell that you cast yourself, the effect becomes extraordinary rather 
than a continuous spell effect, and therefore cannot be dispelled by any
 means. The <i>haste</i> spell otherwise functions as it normally would,
 is expended normally, and can be countered as a spell at the moment of 
casting. </p>
<p><b>Bounding Assault:</b> At 7th level, you gain Bounding Assault (see page 75 of <i>Player's Handbook II</i>)
 as a bonus feat. You need not have the prerequisites normally required 
for Bounding Assault to gain this feat. If you already have Bounding 
Assault, choose a different feat for which you do meet the 
prerequisites. </p>
<p><b>Diligent Rapidity (Ex):</b> At 8th level, you automatically overcome magic and mundane obstacles with the <i>haste</i> spell. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i>
 spell that you cast yourself, you can move and attack normally, even 
under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, as the <i>freedom of movement</i> spell. See the spell description on page 233 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 As an additional effect, you can also move across the surface of placid
 or flowing water, but not whitewater rapids or stormy water, by making 
two move actions in a round. You immediately sink any time you make a 
single move action in a round or come to a complete stop while 
traversing water. </p>
<p><b>Perpetual Options (Ex):</b> At 9th level, you can perform even more actions with the <i>haste</i> spell. Instead of making one extra attack at your highest base attack bonus while under the effect of a <i>haste</i>
 spell that you cast yourself, you now have the choice of making one 
extra move action or one extra standard action. For example, you could 
make three consecutive move actions with this ability, two move actions 
and one standard action, one move action and two standard actions, a 
full attack action and a move action, a full attack action and a 
standard action, a full round action and a move action, or a full round 
action and a standard action. </p>
<p><b>Innervated Speed (Ex):</b> At 10th level, your mastery of the <i>haste</i> spell can bring the world around you to a standstill. Any time you prepare or spontaneously cast <i>haste</i>
 in a 6th level spell slot, you can subsume the spell at the moment of 
casting instead, increasing your speed so greatly that other creatures 
seem frozen in time, as the <i>time stop</i> spell, but for one round. See the spell description on page 294 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 For each spell slot level higher than 6th level, you can extend 
innervated speed by 1 additional round. For example, a sorcerer could 
subsume <i>haste</i> in an 8th level spell slot to create three rounds of innervated speed. You cannot subsume a new <i>haste</i>
 spell until the original innervated speed duration expires and your 
turn ends. Moreover, you cannot subsume a metamagic version of <i>haste</i>. </p>
<h4>Playing a Swiftblade</h4>
<p>As a swiftblade, you have embraced a highly specialized branch of 
arcane study. Traditional arcane spellcasters will scoff at your 
techniques, considering your spellcasting methods to be cutthroat and 
stunted. They could not be both more right and wrong at the same time. 
Being a swiftblade requires more discrimination than being a generic 
spellcaster, as your single-minded devotion unlocks a host of new 
applications for the <i>haste</i> spell. Moreover, your ability to caste <i>haste</i> as a free action allows you to activate your abilities quickly in combat. As your familiarity with the <i>haste</i>
 spell grows, the physical world around you appears to slow down. Taking
 advantage of this perception, you are virtually assured to react first 
in every encounter. </p>
<p><b>Combat</b></p>
<p>Few creatures are faster than you. When reaction time plays an 
important role in combat, you are at a definite advantage. As a natural 
skirmisher, you are acutely aware of how quickly sustained combat can 
end your life. Your speed lets you to close or widen melee distance to 
suit your needs on a round-by-round basis. This versatility is further 
augmented with Spring Attack and Bounding Assault as bonus feats. </p>
<p>Because you can fight well in melee, members of this prestige class 
have more options than most arcane spellcasters. This allows you to 
benefit from buffing spells such as <i>bull's strength </i>and <i>shield</i>.
 With such spells active, you become an even more formidable and 
untouchable foe. As another option, you can hold yourself back and 
punish enemies with area effect spells before closing in for the kill. </p>
<p>Most importantly, your incredible speed causes attacks and targeted 
spells to outright miss. This ability progresses until spells that are 
specifically designed to hamper your movement automatically fail while 
under the effects of your own <i>haste</i> spell. </p>
<p><b>Advancement</b></p>
<p>Speed and mobility are your best assets at lower levels. Constantly 
moving around will serve you more than making continuous attacks, 
especially in conjunction with the combat benefits and extra damage 
offered by swift surge. </p>
<p>Another aspect of advancement to keep in mind is multiclassing. Your 
survivability is greatly improved by taking a level or two of a martial 
class. This grants you a wide range of weapon proficiencies as well as 
combat-oriented feats from which to choose, both of which improve your 
overall effectiveness. </p>
<p>Attaining higher levels of swiftblade expertise eventually grants you
 the ability to make one extra move or standard action while under the 
effects of your own <i>haste</i> spell. There is, of course, no advantage greater than completing the swiftblade prestige class, at which point you can caste <i>haste</i> in higher level spell slots to make time seemingly stand still. </p>
<p><b>Resources</b></p>
<p>Following this prestige class quickly leads one to realize that there
 are few resources available to help you, as your dedicated focus to one
 spell is highly irregular among spellcasters. Short of making contact 
with another swiftblade, you must forge ahead largely alone. Not 
surprisingly, this revelation has inspired many swiftblades to embrace a
 nomadic lifestyle in search of obscure, arcane lore. This is one of the
 main reasons why swiftblades are wanderers at heart, constantly seeking
 new adventurous challenges against which to measure their emerging 
abilities. The monetary reward of treasure hunting is often what fuels 
swiftblades most. </p>
<h4>Swiftblades in the World</h4>
<p>The swiftblade is an excellent choice for martially-orientated arcane
 spellcasters. Although the swiftblade requires spellcasting 
compromises, it does empower the character with the ability to switch 
between melee and spell combat. When compared to more studious arcane 
practitioners, swiftblades are better able to survive encounters after 
all their spells have been used for the day. This allows the members of 
this prestige class to fill multiple rolls within an adventuring party. </p>
<p>While most swiftblades are resolved to lives of danger and 
excitement, some darker members of this prestige class resort to working
 as assassins. It's also not uncommon to find swiftblades among rangers 
and scouts, as they are well suited to skirmish warfare. </p>
<p><b>Organization</b></p>
<p>The wandering nature of swiftblades makes it hard for this prestige 
class to centralize its teachings. At best, a master and apprentice 
might be encountered traveling together. On the few occasions when a 
formal school has been established, devoted arcane spellcasters have 
gone out of their way to discredit such institutions and discourage 
students from embracing their teachings. The reason behind such attacks 
is both edifying and surprising. Powerful spellcasters quickly realize 
how effective swiftblades could be in combat without ever mastering the 
higher-level spells. Swiftblades are thus a wildcard that threatens to 
destroy those standards. Without turning swiftblades into an alluring, 
forbidden practice, they slander the schools publicly and outlaw their 
expansion privately. </p>
<p><b>NPC Reactions</b></p>
<p>Adepts have a starting attitude of unfriendly toward swiftblades, 
being more acquainted with the disrepute heaped onto their kind by 
higher-level spellcasters. Few adepts ever take the time to understand 
why swiftblades are so preoccupied with a single spell. </p>
<p>Aristocrats have a starting attitude of indifferent to friendly 
toward swiftblades. Young aristocrats in particular are fatalistically 
attracted to the excitement and speed that seems to govern the lives of 
swiftblades. </p>
<p>Commoners have a starting attitude of indifferent toward swiftblades,
 having never really heard of them before. They are more likely to judge
 swiftblades by appearance, which typically resembles an 
adventure-seeking roustabout (probably up to no good). </p>
<p>Experts have a starting attitude of indifferent to unfriendly toward 
swiftblades, having heard distant rumblings of trouble caused by their 
kind. As a result, experts tend to keep their guard up around 
swiftblades and remain mindful of their business. </p>
<p>Warriors have a starting attitude of indifferent to friendly towards 
swiftblades, in recognition of their martial talents. Warriors respect 
swiftblades for being willing to get their hands dirty in combat and 
lacking the pretensions that are normally associated with arcane 
spellcasters. </p>
<h4>Swiftblade Lore</h4>
<p>Characters with Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history) can 
research swiftblades to learn more about them. When a character makes a 
skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the information
 from lower DCs. </p>
<p><b>DC 10:</b> "Swiftblades are a radical style of spellcasting whereby the practitioner focuses on enhancing their martial speed." </p>
<p><b>DC 15:</b> "Swiftblades focus on the <i>haste</i> spell to such an extent that their appearance blurs and no spell effect can impede them." </p>
<p><b>DC 20:</b> "Swiftblades trade spellcasting ability for specialized applications of the <i>haste</i> spell and the ability to make time stand still." </p>
<p><b>DC 30:</b> Characters who achieve this level of success can learn 
important details about specific swiftblades, including notable 
accomplishments and mentors from whom they studied. </p>
<p>Player characters trying to locate swiftblades must make a DC 20 
Gather Information check to discover the necessary intermediaries and 
protocols for contacting one. If the player characters are searching for
 a swiftblade among soldier garrisons, give them a +2 circumstance bonus
 on the check. </p>
<h4>Swiftblades in the Game</h4>
<p>Balance is key to playing an effective swiftblade. You can hold your 
own in the fray of battle but must be wary of so doing. For this reason,
 it is crucial to properly prepare for combat with the appropriate 
spells. Weakening the enemy with area effect spells such as <i>cone of cold</i> or <i>fireball</i> is always a good opening tactic. Spells that hamper your opponents, such as <i>slow</i>, are also effective choices. Then, when you move into close combat with your <i>haste</i> spell active, the enemy is already softened up. </p>
<p>You will face difficulty deciding what equipment to purchase. As a 
hybrid spellcaster/warrior, deciding which role to pursue more actively 
depends entirely on the encountered situation. Your most important boon 
is speed, along with the ability to cast <i>haste</i> as a free action. As well, keep in mind that although your companions cannot benefit from <i>haste</i> as you do, they will nonetheless appreciate the regular bonuses of that spell. </p>
<p><b>Adaptation</b></p>
<p>Swiftblades can easily be incorporated into highly developed magical 
societies. As practitioners of an exceedingly focused type of 
spellcasting, swiftblades most naturally fit into campaigns where many 
disciplines and schools of magic already exist. In campaigns where 
arcane spellcasting is less common, swiftblades become highly irregular.
 Regardless of the setting, a swiftblade might also be encountered as 
the personal guard to an important dignitary or among a group of elite 
warriors who pledged their services to a specific kingdom. </p>
<p><b>Encounters</b></p>
<p>Swiftblades can be encountered anywhere. They could be adventuring 
for gold or traveling in the hope of broadening their arcane 
understanding. Swiftblades are proud of their abilities and invite 
challenges to test their mettle. </p>
<p><b>EL 12: </b>The player characters enter an inn and are directed to 
the only available seats by the tavern wench. An elf by the name of 
Kaavel Blackstone already sits at this table. After introductions are 
made, he asks if the group is here to enjoy or participate in the local 
marathon -- a yearly event which tests the resolve and speed of all 
contestants. Kaavel is a participant in the race with high hopes of 
winning, and he suggests that the characters place a wager on him (if 
they hope to increase the weight of their pouches). Little does Kaavel 
realize that a rival competitor plans to ambush him with hired thugs 
before the race. The first wave of this ambush is about to be launched 
in the tavern. </p>
