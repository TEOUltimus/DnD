<p>This column aims to provide players with tips on creating effective 
and interesting characters of various types. Whether you're a beginning 
player creating your very first character or an experienced gamer 
looking to put some punch into an old standby, this column is for you.</p>
<h4>Assets</h4>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2007-17%20-%20Knight%20Protector%20--%20Honor,%20Honesty,%20Chivalry,%20Courage_files/dnd_prc_20070717.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="160" width="300"> Knight Protectors from <i>Complete Warrior</i> have many useful abilities. Here are a few things to consider when building a knight protector:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Good Base Attack Bonus: </b>A knight protector's base attack bonus progresses as that of a fighter.</li>
<li><b>Good Hit Dice: </b>Knight protectors use 10-sided hit dice, making them tougher than most other characters.</li>
<li><b>Good Will Saves: </b>Knight protectors have good Will saving 
throws (PHB 22). Neither fighters nor paladins have good Will saves, 
making this a real plus for prospective members.</li>
<li><b>Special Abilities: </b>Knight protectors gain a whole range of 
special abilities that augment their offensive and defensive 
capabilities as they progress in levels.</li>
<ul>
<li>At 1st level, they gain defensive stance, which allows them to 
augment an ally's armor class by transferring up to 2 points of their 
own armor class to him. Every three levels (4th, 7th, and 10th) 
afterward, they gain the ability to transfer 1 additional point of armor
 class. They also gain the shining beacon ability, which grants all 
nearby allies a bonus to resist fear effects.</li>
<li>At 2nd level, they gain Iron Will as a bonus feat and the best 
effort ability, which enables them to add a +2 bonus to one skill check 
per day. This bonus increases by one every three levels (at 5th and 
8th).</li>
<li>At 3rd level, they gain supreme cleave, allowing them to make a 5-foot step between attacks when using Cleave or Great Cleave.</li>
<li>At 6th level, a knight protector gains the ability to make one 
additional attack of opportunity per round; at 9th level, he can make an
 additional two such attacks per round.</li>
<li>At 10th level, a knight protector can make one retributive strike 
against an opponent that renders an ally unconscious or helpless. He can
 make a number of these attacks per day equal to his Charisma modifier.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<p>The knight protector's advantages come at a price. Here are a few things to consider when thinking about such a character:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hard Qualification: </b>Only a select few individuals qualify to 
become knight protectors. Prospective members must be either lawful good
 or lawful neutral and have a base attack bonus of +5. Additionally, 
they must have Armor Proficiency (heavy), Cleave, Great Cleave, Mounted 
Combat, and Power Attack, as well as six ranks in Diplomacy, four ranks 
in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), and six ranks in Ride.</li>
<li><b>Poor Fortitude Saves: </b>Knight protectors have poor Fortitude 
saving throws (PHB 22). However, some of the classes required to qualify
 for the prestige class -- fighters and paladins, for example -- have 
good Fortitude saves, offsetting this weakness to some degree.</li>
<li><b>Poor Reflex Saves: </b>Knight protectors have poor Reflex saving 
throws (PHB 22). Unfortunately, many individuals qualifying for this 
prestige class have levels in classes -- particularly fighter and 
paladin -- that also have poor Reflex saves making this a major weakness
 of the prestige class.</li>
<li><b>Skill Points: </b>A knight protector receives 2 (+ Int bonus) skill points at every class level.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Knight Protectors in Greyhawk</b></p>
<p>In the <i>World of Greyhawk</i>, the Knight Protectors of the Great 
Kingdom were once a mighty order of knighthood famed for its member's 
honor and skill at arms. At its zenith, many hundreds of skilled 
fighters bore the order's device (the great crowned sun of Aerdy guarded
 by a white axe and red arrow) into battle. Now the order has fallen 
into disfavor, shattered by the foulest treachery from within its own 
ranks. Almost 400 years ago, Sir Kargoth -- one of the greatest of the 
order -- betrayed his honor and the order by making a pact with 
Demogorgon, Prince of Demons. As well as unleashing a terrible demon 
into the Great Kingdom, he seduced 13 of his fellow knights to join him 
in his dark compact. Their betrayal (and subsequent grizzly deaths) 
powered the creation of the first and most powerful death knights. The 
hunt for these renegade knights and political changes within the Great 
Kingdom tipped the order into slow decline. Now, barely two dozen 
scattered knights claim membership.</p>
<p>For more information on the Knight Protectors, check out <i>Dragon Magazine </i>issues 290, 291, and 293; the <i>Living Greyhawk Gazetteer, Living Greyhawk Journal </i>issue 5, and the <i>World of Greyhawk </i>boxed set. A 3.0 ruleset version of this prestige class appeared in <i>Sword and Fist</i>.</p>

<h4>Playing a Knight Protector</h4>
<p>Knight protectors are dedicated to the ideals of chivalry and honor, 
fighting moral decay wherever they find it. They adhere to a rigid code 
of honor which they are charged to defend above all other things. (This 
code is described on page 56 of <i>Complete Warrior</i>). Paladins, 
ex-paladins, fighters, and knights (PHB II) are most commonly associated
 with this class, but duskblades (PHB II) and samurai (<i>Complete Warrior</i>) also occasionally join this elite order.</p>
<p><b>Skills and Feats</b></p>
<p>While knight protectors are essentially armored killing machines 
adept at dealing a lot of damage, choosing the right selection of skills
 and feats can give them a significant advantage in battle. Remember 
that a prospective member of the order must have the following feats and
 skills:</p>
<p><b>Skills: </b>Diplomacy 6, Knowledge (nobility and royalty) 4, and Ride 6.</p>
<p><b>Feats: </b>Armor Proficiency (heavy), Cleave, Great Cleave, Mounted Combat, and Power Attack.</p>
<p>The combination of Mounted Combat and Ride gives them useful mobility
 in large open areas (and extra attacks if they are riding a warhorse or
 paladin's mount). Cleave and Great Cleave make them particularly 
effective at slaughtering large numbers of lesser foes such as goblins 
and orcs. Unfortunately, the large number of required feats for this 
prestige class makes any meaningful customization of prospective members
 difficult unless they are human fighters.</p>
<p>Other useful feats for knight protectors include Lightning Reflexes 
(to offset one of their main weaknesses), Improved Toughness (<i>Complete Warrior</i>
 -- bestows more hit points), and Weapon Focus. A knight protector 
planning to fight from horseback should take Spirited Charge (used in 
conjunction with a lance), Ride-By Attack, Trample, and Cavalry Charger 
(a tactical feat from <i>Complete Warrior</i>).</p>
<p><b>In Battle </b></p>
<p>Knight protectors lead from the front, getting into melee combat as 
quickly as possible. They often assume positions of leadership in an 
adventuring group. This is particularly true for knight protectors with 
levels of paladin.</p>
<p>Knight protectors encountered above ground are often mounted, 
allowing them to make good use of their lances and mobility to defeat 
their opponents. Whenever they fight, they wear the best armor and carry
 the best shield that they can afford; many use tower shields. Their 
armor and weapons are often enchanted. When choosing their weapon of 
choice, many knights pick the favored weapon of their patron deity. 
Thus, followers of Heironeous wield battleaxes or longswords, Hextor's 
faithful use flails, and St Cuthbert's adherents use clubs or other 
bludgeoning weapons.</p>
<p>Because he is often in battle, a knight protector should look to 
augment his defensive and offensive capabilities as much as possible by 
enchanting his armor and weapons. They should also carry several backup 
weapons in case they are disarmed or they meet a foe with damage 
reduction. A cold iron or adamantine morningstar (dealing bludgeoning 
and piercing damage) is a fantastic backup weapon. Similarly, they 
should carry a light slashing weapon to use while grappled or while 
cutting their way out of the belly of some terrifying beast (such as the
 dreaded purple worm).</p>
<p>A knight protector should also carry some healing magic. Allied 
clerics cannot always reach a compatriot who has cut a swath through the
 enemy's ranks.</p>
<h4>Sample Knight Protector: Sir Elliast Cranden</h4>

 the beginning of his turn, Sir Elliast can transfer up to 2 points of 
Armor Class to any ally within 5 ft. who has less Hit Dice than him. 
This reduces his armor class by the amount. <br><b>Shield Block (Ex) </b>During his turn, Sir Elliast can designate a single opponent. Against that opponent, his shield bonus increases by 1. <br><b>Fighting Challenge (Ex) </b>As
 a swift action, Sir Elliast can challenge a single opponent with an 
Intelligence of 5 or higher, a language of sorts, and a CR greater than 
or equal to 6. Against such an opponent, Sir Elliast gains a +1 morale 
bonus on Will saves, attack rolls, and damage rolls. This effect lasts 
for 7 rounds and expends one use of Sir Elliast's knight's challenge. If
 Sir Elliast is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points as a result of this 
challenge, he loses two daily uses of his knight's challenge. <br><b>Test of Mettle (Ex) </b>As
 a swift action, Sir Eliast can spend one of his fighting challenges to 
challenge all enemies within 100 ft. that have Intelligence of 5 or 
higher and a language of sorts to which he has line of sight and line of
 effect. Affected individuals must have a CR greater than or equal to 6.
 Targets failing a DC 14 Will save are forced to attack Sir Elliast with
 ranged or melee attacks in preference to all other targets. Foes using 
spells must include Sir Elliast in the area of affect. If reduced to 0 
hit points or fewer as a result of this, Sir Elliant gains one use of 
knight's challenge. <br><b>Bulwark of Defense (Ex) </b>An opponent that 
starts its turn in Sir Elliast's threatened area treats all the squares 
that he threatens as difficult terrain. <br><b>Armor Mastery (Ex) </b>Sir Elliast ignores the speed reduction of medium armor.</p>
<p>Sir Elliast Cranden had the following ability scores before racial 
adjustments, Hit Die ability score increases, and stat boosting items: 
Str 15, Dex 8, Con 13, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 14.</p>
