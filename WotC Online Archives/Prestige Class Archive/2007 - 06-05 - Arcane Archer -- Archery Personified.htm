<p> Arcane archers (DMG 176) are peerless archers able to interweave 
their magic and ranged attacks into a deadly barrage of arrows to strike
 down their enemies. They ward the borders of their forest homes as 
commanders of deadly elven warbands.</p>
<h4>Assets</h4>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2006-05%20-%20Arcane%20Archer%20--%20Archery%20Personified_files/dnd_prc_20070605_archer.jpg" alt="Arcane Archer" title="Arcane Archer" align="right" border="0" height="340" width="200"> Arcane archers have many useful abilities. Here are a few things to consider when building an arcane archer:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Good Base Attack Bonus:</b> An arcane archer's base attack bonus progresses as that of a fighter.</li>
<li><b>Good Hit Dice:</b> Arcane archers use eight-sided hit dice, making them tougher than many other characters.</li>
<li><b>Good Fortitude Saves:</b> Arcane archers have good Fortitude 
saving throws (PH 22). Fighters and rangers also have good Fortitude 
saving throws, making this a particular strength of the class.</li>
<li><b>Good Reflex Saves:</b> Arcane archers have good Reflex saving 
throws (PH 22). None of the classes normally associated with this 
prestige class -- fighter, ranger, sorcerer, or wizard -- havegood 
Reflex saving throws, which means that levels of arcane archer help to 
improve this vital defense.</li>
<li><b>Skill Points:</b> Arcane archers receive 4 (+ Int bonus) skill 
points at every class level and have a number of very useful skills 
including: Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot.</li>
<li><b>Special Abilities:</b> At each new level, an arcane archer gains a
 useful ability that augments his ranged attacks. At 1st level, he gains
 the enhance arrow ability, which transforms his nonmagical arrows into 
magical weapons. For every two additional levels he gains, his arrows 
gain an additional enhancement bonus (for example, +1 at 1st level, +2 
at 3rd level, and so on). At every even-numbered level, he gains 
additional powers. Imbue arrow enables an arcane archer to place an area
 spell on an arrow centered on where the arrow lands. At 4th level he 
can fire a seeker arrow once per day that strikes a known target in 
range even if it must fly around corners! Phase arrow (6th level) allows
 the arcane archer to fire one arrow a day that strikes a known target, 
bypassing any intervening nonmagical barrier such as a wall. At 8th 
level, he can unleash a hail of arrows instead of his normal attack, 
firing a single shot at every target in range (up to a number equal to 
his class level). Finally, at 10th level, an arcane archer can create an
 arrow of death that forces the target struck to make a DC 20 Fortitude 
saving throw or die.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<p>The arcane archer's advantages come at a price. Here are a few things to consider when thinking about such a character:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hard Qualification:</b> Only a select few individuals qualify to 
become arcane archers. A prospective arcane archer must be either an elf
 or half-elf and have a base attack bonus of +6. Additionally, he must 
have Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow),
 and be able to cast 1st-level arcane spells.</li>
<li><b>Poor Will Saves:</b> Arcane archers have poor Will saving throws 
(PH 22). However, many of the classes that are required to qualify for 
arcane archer -- for example, sorcerer and wizard -- have good Will 
saves, offsetting this weakness to some degree.</li>
<li><b>Spellcasting:</b> Arcane archers do not gain any additional spellcasting abilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Playing an Arcane Archer</h4>
<p>Most characters (particularly elves) that become arcane archers are 
fighter/wizards. Half-elves have slightly more flexibility when 
qualifying for this prestige class because they designate their 
highest-level class as favored, whereas an elf's favored class is 
wizard. All arcane archers must be able to cast 1st-level arcane spells 
and thus must have at least one level of sorcerer or wizard (from the <i>Player's Handbook</i>), warmage or wu jen (both from <i>Complete Arcane</i>),
 or beguiler or duskblade (both from PH II). Alternatively, characters 
taking a less traditional route to qualify for this prestige class could
 have two levels in bard or four levels in hexblade (<i>Complete Warrior</i>) or spellthief (<i>Complete Adventurer</i>).</p>
<p>Arcane archers must also have a base attack bonus of +6 and three 
archery-related feats, meaning that most archers have at least four 
levels of fighter.</p>
<p>Several other prestige classes mesh well with arcane archer, notably darkwood sniper and order of the bow initiate (<i>Complete Warrior</i> 24 and 68 respectively). Alternatively, if an arcane archer is proficient with the greatbow or composite greatbow (<i>Complete Warrior</i> 154 and 156), then llll <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/prc/20061004a">exotic weapon master</a> (<i>Complete Warrior</i> 30) is an interesting choice. For an example of this build, check out <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/prc/20061010a">Exotic Weapon Masters Three</a>.</p>
<p><b>Skills and Feats</b></p>
<p>Arcane archers need to plan their feat acquisition carefully to get 
the most out of their ranged attacks. Beyond Point Blank Shot, Precise 
Shot, and Weapon Focus, several other options exist.</p>
<p><b>Skirmishing Arcane Archer:</b> Dodge, Mobility, and Shot on the Run.</p>
<p><b>High Damage Output Arcane Archer:</b> Rapid Shot, Manyshot, and Improved Precise Shot.</p>
<p>Several feats from <i>Complete Warrior</i> provide further 
interesting tactical options: Improved Rapid Shot, Ranged Disarm, Ranged
 Pin, Ranged Sunder, and Sharpshooting (unless the character has 
Improved Precise Shot). Finally, <i>Races of the Wild</i> also features three feats useful to an archer: Able Sniper, Plunging Shot, and Woodland Archer.</p>
<p>Arcane archers with four levels of fighter should take Weapon 
Specialization. Improved Initiative is also a good choice; acting before
 enemy spellcasters and readying an action to shoot them when they start
 spellcasting can pay rich dividends.</p>
<p>Arcane archers should also look to their defenses. Depending on their
 class mix, they may find it worthwhile to invest in Iron Will or 
Lightning Reflexes to boost these potentially low saving throws.</p>
<p>Listen and Spot are useful for arcane archers, as are Hide and Move 
Silently. Additionally, Climb and Jump enable an arcane archer to move 
into a good shooting position, while Spellcraft lets the character 
identify what spell enemy spellcasters are preparing.</p>
<p><b>In Battle </b></p>
<p>Arcane archers, obviously, are excellent ranged combatants. As such, 
they should not allow themselves to get drawn into melee. Instead, they 
should use their mobility and stealth to skirt the edges of a fight 
while firing at exposed opponents. Enemy spellcasters make excellent and
 easy targets for arcane archers, as they are often slightly removed 
from the battle.</p>
<p>Members of this prestige class should use a composite bow to benefit 
from the extra damage potential, enchanting it as quickly as possible. 
Adding special abilities to the bow such as <i>flaming </i>or <i>frost </i>further
 adds to an arcane archer's damage potential. An arcane archer should be
 sure to carry arrows of different types -- adamantine, cold iron, and 
silver -- to overcome foes' damage reduction. A <i>quiver of Ehlonna </i>is the perfect item to carry dozens of arrows (and a spare bow, just in case).</p>
<p>Armor can be a tricky subject for arcane archers, because it can 
interfere with spellcasting. Some classes, such as the beguiler, 
duskblade and warmage, have a limited ability to ignore this effect, but
 more traditional arcane spellcasting classes run into problems when 
casting spells while wearing armor. Refer to the Arcane Spell Failure 
section of the recent <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/prc/20070403">bladesinger</a> article for strategies to reduce or eliminate this risk.</p>
