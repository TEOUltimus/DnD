<p>This column aims to provide players with tips on creating effective 
and interesting characters of various types. Whether you're a beginning 
player creating your very first character or an experienced gamer 
looking to put some punch into an old standby, this column is for you.</p>
<p>Radiant servants of Pelor (<i>Complete Divine</i>, page 52) are 
devoted servants of the Sun Father. They minister to the needs of good 
folk everywhere and protect them from the rising tide of evil. They hold
 a particular hatred for undead and are puissant healers.</p>
<h4>Assets</h4>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2008-07%20-%20Radiant%20Cleric%20of%20Pelor_files/dnd_cwc_20070807.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="250" width="200"> Radiant servants of Pelor have many useful abilities. Here are a few things to consider when building such a character: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Average Base Attack Bonus: </b>A radiant servant of Pelor's base attack bonus progresses as that of a cleric. </li>
<li><b>Good Fortitude Saves: </b>A radiant servant of Pelor has a good 
Fortitude saving throws (PH 22). Clerics also have good Fortitude saving
 throws, making radiant servants of Pelor very resistant to such 
affects. </li>
<li><b>Good Will Saves: </b>A radiant servant of Pelor has good Will 
saving throws (PH 22). Clerics also have good Will saving throws that, 
coupled with their high Wisdom, make radiant servants of Pelor 
particularly resistant to such attacks. </li>
<li><b>Good Spellcasting Progression: </b>When a character gains a new 
level in radiant servant of Pelor, he also gains new spells per day (and
 spells known, if applicable) as if he had gained a level in whatever 
class he belonged to before he became a radiant servant. </li>
<li><b>Special Abilities: </b>Along with his impressive spellcasting 
abilities, a radiant servant of Pelor gains a suite of special abilities
 that augment both his healing ability and his undead-destroying 
capability. Levels in radiant servant of Pelor stack with cleric levels 
for all purposes regards turning undead. </li>
<ul>
<li>At 1st level, he gains extra greater turning attempts, and any spell
 he casts with the light descriptor becomes larger and more powerful. </li>
<li>At 2nd level, a radiant servant of Pelor becomes immune to all 
diseases. Additionally, Empower Healing allows him to apply the affects 
of Empower Spell to any domain spell he casts from the Healing domain 
(without the spell using up a higher-level spell slot). </li>
<li>At 3rd level, a radiant servant of Pelor radiates an aura of warding, boosting his ally's Will saving throws. </li>
<li>At 5th level, he gains access to either the Glory or Purification domain (both from <i>Complete Divine</i>). </li>
<li>At 6th level, any domain spell a radiant servant of Pelor casts from
 the Healing domain is treated as if it were affected by Maximize Spell 
(without the spell using up a higher-level spell slot). This ability 
supersedes his empower healing ability. </li>
<li>At 8th level, a radiant servant of Pelor can spend two of his daily 
turning attempts to damage all undead within 100 ft. of him by releasing
 a burst of positive energy. </li>
<li>At 10th level, he gains the supreme healing ability, which enables 
him to apply the affects of Empower Spell and Maximize Spell to any 
domain spell he casts from the Healing domain. The spell does not take 
up a higher-level spell slot.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<p>The radiant servant of Pelor's advantages come at a price. Here are a
 few things to consider when thinking about such a character: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Restricted Qualification: </b>Only worshippers of Pelor able to 
cast 1st-level divine spells can qualify to become a radiant servant of 
Pelor. Prospective members must be neutral good, have access to the Sun 
domain, +5 base Will saving throw, 5 ranks in Heal, 9 ranks in Knowledge
 (religion), and Extra Turning (PH 94). In practice, this means that a 
radiant servant of Pelor must have at least one level of cleric. </li>
<li><b>Poor Hit Dice: </b>A radiant servant of Pelor use six-sided hit dice, making them less robust than normal clerics. </li>
<li><b>Poor Reflex Saves: </b>A radiant servant of Pelor has a poor 
Reflex saving throw (PH 22). Clerics also have poor Reflex saves, making
 this a major weakness of the prestige class. </li>
<li><b>Skill Points: </b>A radiant servant of Pelor receives only 2 (+ Int bonus) skill points at every class level. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Playing a Radiant Servant of Pelor</h4>
<p>All the general advice relating to <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20041125a">playing a cleric character</a>
 applies to a radiant servant of Pelor. However, radiant servants of 
Pelor are particular good at two things -- healing and turning undead. 
They should seek to do those things as often as possible. In many 
fights, a radiant servant's prodigious healing ability is all that 
stands between his companions and death, while his ability to turn 
undead can annihilate foes before they decimate the party. </p>
<p><b>Healing</b></p>
<p>A radiant servant of Pelor is almost certainly a party's main healer 
and should pick his spells and magic items appropriately. Using his 
domain spell slots to memorize healing spells allows him to make 
effective use of his Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, and supreme healing 
abilities. Combining such spells with Divine Metamagic provides powerful
 healing to those in dire need. </p>
<p>Radiant servants of Pelor specializing in the healing arts should consider the following feats: </p>
<p><b>Augment Healing(CD): </b>Healing spells do +2 per spell level.<br><b>Healing Devotion(CC): </b>Gain or grant fast healing for 1 minute. <br><b>Imbued Healing(CC): </b>Provide beneficial carrier effect with healing spells. <br><b>Reach Spell(CD, 1): </b>Touch spell becomes a ray with 30-ft. range. <br><b>Sacred Healing(CD): </b>Allies gain fast healing 3 for a short time. <br><b>Touch of Healing(CC): </b>Heal 3 points of damage per level of the highest-level healing spell you have available to cast.</p>
<p>1: Extremely useful for healing an ally you cannot reach. </p>
<p><b>Turning Undead</b></p>
<p>Radiant servants of Pelor live to battle undead and are normally the 
first into battle when such foes appear, using their divine powers to 
blast them out of existence. Such characters expecting to battle undead 
on a regular basis should consider the following feats: </p>
<p><b>Empower Turning(CD): </b>Can turn more undead.<br><b>Extra Turning(PH): </b>Turn undead an extra four times a day. <br><b>Discipline of the Sun(CD): </b>Spend an extra turn attempt to destroy undead instead of turning them. <br><b>Quicken Turning(CD): </b>Can turn undead as a free action. <br><b>Sacred Vengeance(CW): </b>Spend a turn undead attempt to deal an extra 2d6 points of damage on melee attacks against undead.</p>
<p><b>Divine Feats</b></p>
<p><i>Complete Divine </i>introduces a new kind of feat -- the divine 
feat. Simply put, these feats allow a cleric to spend one or more of his
 daily uses of turn undead to power an ability granted by a divine feat.
 Because a radiant servant of Pelor must have the Extra Turning feat, he
 has more turn attempts than normal for a cleric. Normally, he is 
unlikely to be in a situation where he can use all these attempts in any
 given adventure. Thus, taking one or more divine feats makes perfect 
sense, because it allows him to make use of his turn attempts even when 
undead are not present. Divine feats also appear in <i>Complete Warrior </i>and <i>Complete Champion</i>. A complete list appears below. </p>
<p><b>Discipline of the Sun(CD):</b> spend an extra turn attempt to destroy undead instead of turning them.<br><b>Divine Cleansing(CW):</b> Gain +2 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves. <br><b>Divine Metamagic(CD):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempts to enhance spells with a metamagic feat you know. <br><b>Divine Might(CW):</b> Add Cha bonus to weapon damage. <br><b>Divine Resistance(CW):</b> Gain resistance to cold 5, electricity 5, and fire 5. <br><b>Divine Shield(CW):</b> Add Cha bonus as sacred bonus to your shield's defense. <br><b>Divine Spell Power(CD):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempts to increase your caster level. <br><b>Divine Vigor(CW):</b> Increase base speed by 10 ft., gain +2 hp/level. <br><b>Domain Spontaneity(CD):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempt to spontaneously cast a domain spell. <br><b>Elemental Healing(CD):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempt to heal nearby elementals. <br><b>Elemental Smiting(CD):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempt to smite an elemental. <br><b>Glorious Weapons(CD):</b> Allies' weapons gain an alignment for overcoming DR. <br><b>Profane Bonus(CD):</b> Nearby inflict spells are maximized for 1 round. <br><b>Retrieve Spell(CC):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempts to regain a previously cast spell. <br><b>Sacred Boost(CD):</b> Nearby cure spells are maximized for 1 round. <br><b>Sacred Healing(CD):</b> Allies gain fast healing 3 for a short time. <br><b>Sacred Vengeance(CW):</b> +2d6 points of damage on melee attacks against undead. <br><b>Spiritual Counter(CC):</b> Spend turn/rebuke attempts to counterspell. <br><b>True Believer(CD):</b> Gain a +3 bonus on one save each day.</p>
<p>CD = <i>Complete Divine</i>, CW = <i>Complete Warrior</i>, CC = <i>Complete Champion</i></p>
