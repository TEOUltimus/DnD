<p>This column aims to provide players with tips on creating effective 
and interesting characters of various types. Whether you're a beginning 
player creating your very first character or an experienced gamer 
looking to put some punch into an old standby, this column is for you.</p>
<p>The first Suel arcanamach (<i>Complete Arcane </i>63) were skilled 
assassins and guards in the Suel Imperium, an ancient empire of 
unimaginable might. While the empire is now long dead -- destroyed by 
the Rain of Colorless Fire -- the teachings of the Suel arcanamach live 
on.</p>
<h4>Assets</h4>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2008-29%20-%20Suel%20Arcanamach_files/dnd_prc_20070829.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="350" width="200"> Suel Arcanamach have many useful abilities. Here are a few things to consider when building such a character.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Average Hit Dice:</b> Suel arcanamachs use eight-sided hit dice, making them more robust than rogues and wizards but less hardy than fighters.</li>
<li><b>Average Base Attack Bonus:</b> A Suel arcanamach's base attack bonus progresses as that of a cleric.</li>
<li><b>Good Reflex Saves:</b> A Suel arcanamanch has a good Reflex saving throw (PHB 22).</li>
<li><b>Good Will Save:</b> A Suel arcanamanch has a good Will saving throw (PHB 22).</li>
<li><b>Spellcasting Progression:</b> With every level of Suel arcanamach
 attained, a character gains the ability to cast a small number of 
sorcerer/wizard spells from the abjuration, divination, illusion, and 
transmutation schools.</li>
<li><b>Special Abilities:</b> Along with his spellcasting abilities, a Suel arcanamach gains a number of special abilities.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Ignore Arcane Spell Failure:</b> At 1st level, a Suel arcanamach 
begins to learn how to offset the arcane spell failure chance of armor. 
This ability increases by 5% every three levels (10% at 4th level, 15% 
at 7th level, and 20% at 10th level).</li>
<li><b>Tenacious Spells:</b> It is particularly hard to dispel a Suel 
arcanamach's class spells. Casters trying to negate them add 6 to the DC
 required to dispel such spells.</li>
<li><b>Dispelling Strike:</b> At 2nd level, a Suel arcanamach can use 
dispelling strike once per day. If he hits an opponent with a melee 
attack, he can target that individual with a targeted <i>greater dispel magic</i>.
 (His dispel check is equal to 1d20+class level+6). At 6th level, he can
 use this ability twice a day, and at 10th level, he can use it three 
times a day.</li>
<li><b>Extended Spellstrength:</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a Suel 
arcanamach learns to double the duration of spells he casts upon himself
 as if he had applied the Extend Spell feat to the spell (but this does 
not increase the spell's effective level or casting time).</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Skill Points:</b> Suel arcanamach gain four skill points a level to spend on a wide range of class skills.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<p>The Suel arcanamach's advantages come at a price. Here are a few things to consider when thinking about such a character:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Poor Fortitude Saves:</b> A Suel arcanamach has a poor Fortitude saving throw (PHB 22).</li>
<li><b>Restricted Qualification:</b> Qualifying to become a Suel 
arcanamach is difficult. A prospective member needs a base attack bonus 
of +6, four ranks in Concentration, Jump, and Tumble, five ranks in 
Spellcraft, the Combat Casting and Iron Will feats, proficiency with 
four martial or exotic weapons, and must speak Ancient Suloise. 
Additionally, the character must have read the <i>Grimoire Arcanamacha </i>or studied with a willing instructor who has done so.</li>
</ul>
<table bgcolor="#c3c3c3" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#f2f2f2">
<p><b>Suel Arcanamach and Greyhawk</b></p>
<p>In the World of Greyhawk, the overwhelming majority of Suel 
arcanamach serve the Scarlet Brotherhood, a secretive, racist 
organization dedicated to rekindling the glories of the Suel Imperium 
and to raising the Suel people above all others.</p>
<p>Some Suel arcanamanch, however, do not serve this evil group, having learned their skills from copies of the <i>Grimoire Arcanamacha </i>recovered
 from the few accessible ruins in the easternmost portions of the Sea of
 Dust. Such individuals are mercilessly hunted down by the Scarlet 
Brotherhood, which views them as a taint upon the pure and virtuous 
bloodline of the Suel.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous Suel arcanamach of all is Tyrum (detailed 
below), a member of the Scarlet Brotherhood. A devoted follower of The 
Blazing Killer (Pyremius, NE lesser Suel god of Fire, Poison, and 
Murder) and once the Foster Uncle of Faith, he is credited with (among 
many other things) the assassination of <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/prc/20070130">Graf Reydrich of Ahlissa</a> in 586 CY.</p>

<h4>Playing a Suel Arcanamach</h4>
<p>Equally skilled with blade and spell, Suel arcanamachs are normally 
spies, assassins, or elite guards. Many (like the sample Suel arcanamach
 detailed below) are mage-slayers well able to defeat a wizard's arcane 
defenses. Many of their abilities -- tenacious spells and dispelling 
strike, in particular -- make them well suited to taking down 
spellcasters.</p>
<p>Because of the prerequisites for the prestige class, many Suel 
arcanamanchs are multiclassed. Most have levels of ranger or fighter 
complemented by levels of rogue or a spellcasting class such as cleric 
or wizard.</p>
<p><b>Skills</b></p>
<p>Mobility and intelligence are central to a Suel arcanamach's ability 
to quickly disable and kill his foes. Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble 
allow him to move about the battlefield, while Spellcraft lets a Suel 
arcanamach know exactly what spell his opponent is casting. (If 
possible, a Suel Arcanamach should take five ranks in Knowledge [arcane]
 to gain the synergy bonus on Spellcraft).</p>
<p><b>Feats</b></p>
<p>Suel arcanamachs should focus on feats that increase their abilities 
to defeat a spellcaster. Great Fortitude, Iron will, and Lightning 
Reflexes all help a character resist enemy spellcasting, while Improved 
Initiative improves the chances of a Suel Arcanamach striking before his
 opponent. Mage Slayer and Pierce Magical Protection (both from <i>Complete Arcane</i>)
 provide potent attack options against spellcasters but reduce a Suel 
arcanamanch's caster level. Characters taking these feats should also 
select Practiced Spellcaster to offset this as much as possible. 
Additionally, Battlecaster Defense and Battlecaster Offense (both <i>Complete Mage</i>) provide useful offensive and defensive tactical options when mixing melee and spellcasting.</p>
<p><b>In Battle</b></p>
<p>To a certain extent, a Suel arcanamach's exact class mix defines his 
role within an adventuring party. Such characters should be crystal 
clear, however, on their role. Because they probably had to multiclass 
to qualify for the prestige class, they are unlikely to be the best 
fighter, scout, or spellcaster in the group. Rather, they are 
generalists with a wide range of skills. One thing they are not normally
 good at, however, is ranged combat. Dispelling strike, one of a Suel 
arcanamach's main offensive abilities against spellcasters, only works 
with melee attacks.</p>
<p>In battle, Suel arcanamachs need to engage their primary foe -- 
spellcasters -- as quickly as possible. They should use their skills 
such as Jump and Tumble to get over or around the foe's bodyguards or 
companions, leaving the arcanamach's companions to deal with them. 
Alternatively, particularly aggressive or strong Suel arcanamachs could 
use Improved Overrun to reach their target.</p>
<p><b>Equipment and Magic Items</b></p>
<p>When equipping themselves, a Suel arcanamach should purchase items 
that boost saving throws (they are undoubtedly going to have to resist 
many spells during their careers) and touch armor class (to avoid ray 
and touch spells). Thus, even more so than other characters, Suel 
arcanamachs want to invest in <i>rings of protection </i>and <i>cloaks of resistance </i>as well as <i>gloves of dexterity</i>. Potions of <i>blur</i> and <i>cat's grace</i> or a <i>cloak of displacement </i>(at higher level) are good purchases. Potions of <i>lesser restoration </i>are also useful to help shake off the effects of rays and such that do strike home.</p>
<p>Finally, if a Suel arcanamach is going after a specific wizard, he 
should take time to learn about his target's spellcasting proclivities. 
If he's going to be facing an evoker, he should buy lots of healing 
potions, while if he is going to fight a necromancer, more potions of <i>lesser restoration </i>would be in order. Those fighting a conjurer should look to equip their companions with scrolls of <i>fireball </i>or other area-affect spells so that the enemy's many summoned minions can be quickly slain.</p>
<h4>Sample Suel Arcanamach: Tyrum</h4>
<p><i>This charismatic, lean, and fair-skinned man is completely bald. 
His mien is cruel, and his deep blue eyes regard you emotionlessly. He 
wears several earrings in each ear and carries a wickedly sharp rapier.</i></p>

multiple targets are affected by this ability, but only Tyrun gains the 
extended duration. Spells that do not have a Target entry are unaffected
 by this ability even if Tyrun is the only one affected.<br><b>Tenacious Spells </b>Add 6 to the DC required to dispel Tyrun's Suel arcanamach spells.</p>
