<p align="LEFT">The following presents the eye of the Xanathar, a prestige class introduced in Wil Upchurch's <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/prc/20061107a">recent article</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Information is the lifeblood of our guild, which is 
why we are the most powerful faction within it. There is no place on 
Faerun that our eyes cannot reach--do not reach--and no secret is safe 
from our gaze.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">--Guillaume the Eighth Eye</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Eleven%20Eyes%20of%20Xanathar_files/dx1107_TheXanathar.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="302" width="240">As
 an eye of the Xanathar, you are one of eleven handpicked spy-assassins 
who serve the beholder lord known as the Xanathar. You are among his 
most trusted informants, assassins, and spies. You have access to the 
guild's innermost secrets, and eventually come to draw on the power of 
the Xanathar himself to help you complete your missions. You gain a 
powerful magic item called the <i>eye of the master</i> that helps you 
detect enemies and then defeat them. The Masters may be the open leaders
 of the guild, but you are the true power behind the Xanathar's mastery 
of his fortunes and operations.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Becoming an Eye of the Xanathar</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Entry Requirements:</b> Any evil alignment; sneak 
attack +1d6; Hide 6 ranks, Intimidate 4 ranks, Knowledge (local 
Waterdeep) 3 ranks, Move Silently 6 ranks, Spot 8 ranks; Great 
Fortitude, Iron Will.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Xanathar handpicks candidates from among the ranks 
of his guild, and most Eyes have at least one level of rogue. The rogue 
class is the easiest path to becoming an Eye; Hide, Move Silently, and 
Spot are all class skills, and the sneak attack from both classes stack.
 Thuggish fighter/rogues are sometimes chosen by the Xanathar, depending
 on his perceived needs, and bards make excellent spies because of their
 powers of persuasion. Dexterity (for stealth), Wisdom (for perception 
and eye ray abilities), and Intelligence (for skills) are key abilities 
for an Eye.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Skills (8 + Int modifier per level):</b> 
Balance, Bluff, Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Disable Device, Disguise, 
Escape Artist, Forgery, Gather Information, Hide, Intimidate, Jump, 
Knowledge (local Calimport, Waterdeep, Westgate), Listen, Move Silently,
 Open Lock, Perform, Profession, Search, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, 
Spot, Tumble.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As they advance in level, Eyes of the Xanathar gain 
abilities that help their spying and information gathering, as well as 
destructive eye rays that mimic the powers of their beholder lord. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eye of the Master:</b> Upon being named an Eye of the
 Xanathar, you are given a magic item that resembles a thick disc with 
one flat side and one convex side. This item is the focus for all of 
your <i>eye of the master</i> abilities. You must hold it up to one of your eyes when using any of the granted abilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>At 1st level, you gain low-light vision and a +4 bonus on all Spot checks.</li>
<li>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to <i>detect magic</i> as the spell three times per day as a supernatural ability.</li>
<li>At 5th level, you gain darkvision to a range of 60 ft. and the 
ability to determine a single creature's alignment once per day per 
point of Wisdom modifier (min. 1) as the <i>know alignment</i> spell.</li>
<li>At 7th level, you gain the ability to <i>see invisibility</i> as the spell once per day per point of Wisdom modifier (min. 1).</li>
<li>At 10th level, you gain the see through the eye as if with <i>true seeing</i> once per day per point of Wisdom modifier (min. 1).</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Portal Use:</b> You know the locations of and have 
free use of all of the Xanathar's guild portals, granting you easy 
travel between Skullport, Waterdeep, Westgate, and Calimport.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Release the Eye:</b> Beginning at 3rd level, you can release your <i>eye of the master</i> and it will float near your eye, allowing you to use its powers while keeping both hands free.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Attach the Eye:</b> Beginning at 4th level, you can attach your <i>eye of the master</i>
 to a tentacle that grows out of the back of your head on command. It 
takes a standard action to attach the eye and grow the tentacle, as well
 as to retract the tentacle and disengage the eye.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the <i>eye</i> is attached you may not use its 
detection powers (those granted by Eye of the Master), but you can shoot
 rays of magical energy that mimic some of a beholder's eye rays. 
Shooting a ray requires a standard action, has a range of 100 feet with 
no range penalty, and requires a ranged touch attack roll to hit your 
target. The save DC to resist these effects is 10 + your class level + 
your Charisma modifier. </p>
<p align="LEFT"> You may use the attached <i>eye</i><i>of the master </i>a
 number of times per day equal to 1/2 your class level (rounded up) + 
Wisdom modifier to cast any of the listed spell-like abilities. </p>
<ul>
<li>Starting at 4th level, you can cast <i>charm person</i>.</li>
<li>Starting at 6th level, you can cast <i>inflict moderate wounds</i>.</li>
<li>Starting at 8th level, you can cast <i>poison</i>.</li>
<li>Starting at 10th level, you can cast <i>hold monster</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sneak Attack:</b> You deal extra damage when you catch a foe flat-footed or flank a foe (as the rogue class feature described in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, pg. 50). Sneak attack dice attained from multiple sources stack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Perfect Sneak Attack:</b> When your <i>eye of the master</i>
 is released, it can help you find weaknesses in your opponent's 
defenses. As a standard action, you can make a sneak attack against an 
adjacent foe even if you are not flanking them or they have their 
Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Send the Eye:</b> Starting at 7th level, you can cause your <i>eye of the master</i> to float away from you to a range of 5 feet per class level. The <i>eye</i> flies at a rate of 30 feet per round and you can control it as a free action. While the <i>eye</i> is away from you, you can see through the <i>eye</i> as if you were standing in its position, and you can use any of the detection abilities the <i>eye</i> offers. You cannot use the <i>eye</i>'s rays or use it to make a perfect sneak attack while it is floating away from you in this manner.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Playing an Eye of the Xanathar</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The word of the Xanathar is your law, even though he 
usually gives you free reign to go about your business. As long as you 
continue to provide him with information and the timely deaths of his 
rivals and their interests, you can pursue your own interests as well. 
You are at your best operating behind the scenes, using stealth and the 
power of your <i>eye of the master</i> to cultivate contacts and to 
dispatch enemies who are unaware of your presence. It is important to 
surround yourself with loyal allies and minions for those times when you
 are discovered, for the presence of a beholder or its surrogate is sure
 to bring a city's "heroes" down upon you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Xanathar's organization is not yet so large that his
 minions must all work their own territories, thus the eyes of the 
Xanathar often work together on one or more missions. Alliances between 
more than two eyes at a time are rare, however, since too many cross 
purposes tend to work against each. The eyes are not insecure amongst 
themselves as are the Masters of the Xanathar's businesses. They know 
that they have been handpicked by the Xanathar, and the trials they 
undergo upon induction into this cabal only serve to strengthen their 
bond.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat:</b> Stealth is the key to survival for an eye
 of the Xanathar. Your combat skills do not progress as quickly once you
 pledge yourself to the Xanathar, but the abilities and contacts you 
gain more than make up for it. Eyes often choose the Leadership feat as 
soon as they can in order to attract a loyal fighter or wizard cohort. 
The powers of the <i>eye of the master</i> are best suited to hindering and disabling opponents (or converting them in the case of the <i>charm person</i>
 power), leaving them weakened for others to finish off. Each eye spends
 a fair amount of gold in the cities where they operate most, in order 
to maintain a network of thugs and informants that can be called into 
duty quickly and discretely. Even the lowest street thug can help you 
immensely in combat, giving you the chance to flank your targets and 
utilize your sneak attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As your eye rays get stronger, you can rely more on them and less on hired help. Starting at 6th level your <i>eye of the master</i>
 lets you flank opponents without having an ally present--this is 
perhaps the most key ability when you play the role of assassin. Your 
ability to <i>inflict moderate wounds</i> allows you to weaken enemies before you engage them, or to finish off foes from a safe distance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once you reach 8th level you have the ability to <i>poison</i>
 your foes from a distance, and if you are well hidden they might not 
even know what has happened. Taking the monstrous feat Ability Focus 
lets you increase the save DC against this powerful attack, while Weapon
 Focus increases your chances of hitting nimble targets.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Advancement:</b> Not long ago, the Xanathar commanded
 each of his eleven Masters to send him one of their finest operatives. 
These consummate rogues were tested for loyalty, prowess, and mental 
fortitude. Once assembled, these rogues became the Eleven Eyes of the 
Xanathar. It is a terrifying experience to stand before the Xanathar and
 be judged, but those who come through it are well rewarded.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As eyes are killed off on missions (or by the Xanathar),
 they are replaced by new recruits. Each eye is ranked by his seniority,
 from the Eleventh Eye up to the First Eye, and this system is never 
questioned even if lower-ranked Eyes manage to become more valuable to 
the organization than their more senior brethren. The lesser eyes are 
given mostly information gathering or bribery missions, using their 
abilities to spy on enemies or to charm merchants and political leaders 
into serving the Xanathar's Guild--although not by that name, to be 
sure. As eyes advance in levels, the missions they receive focus on more
 wealthy and powerful patrons, as well as potential enemies marked for 
elimination. An eye of the Xanathar might also be released from a 
specific duty to simply advance the interests of the guild in a 
particular area. This road is often chosen when too many eyes are 
operating in the same city at one time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As you gain levels in the eye of the Xanathar prestige 
class, you should keep your Hide and Spot skills as high as possible. 
These are the cornerstones of your profession, along with Knowledge 
(local) in the areas that you most often operate in. Negotiation skills 
such as Bluff and Diplomacy can help you where intimidation and coin 
fail, and skills and feats that help you avoid combat, like Tumble and 
Mobility, can help offset your lack of melee power. The Leadership feat 
is very useful to insure a steady supply of loyal underlings that can 
provide support when you find yourself in the thick of trouble.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Resources:</b> The eleven eyes of the Xanathar are a 
tight-knit group of individuals who are not opposed to helping their 
fellows. Even when you are not working with another eye, others in the 
area will likely be willing to help you with information or loans, 
assuming you can find them. Eyes always have an initial attitude of 
friendly toward other eyes; some eyes might even be helpful, especially 
if they have the chance to help an eye of a higher rank.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Xanathar does not feel the need to overly reward his servants--the <i>eye of the master</i>
 is already a powerful gift indeed. Anyone picked to become an eye is 
assumed to have the skills and means to acquire just about anything they
 might need. The Xanathar is also hesitant to use his own contacts to 
aid an eye, especially since he might be sending that same agent against
 the contact at some time in the future. Eyes that serve the Xanathar 
for a year or more, regardless of rank, are given a special suit of 
masterwork studded leather armor that can be enchanted by guild wizards 
for a 20% discount. This suit is jet black and has a subtle eye, raised 
like a brand near the chest, that seems to drink in darkness, granting 
the wearer a +2 bonus on Hide checks in areas of no greater than shadowy
 illumination.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eyes of the Xanathar in the World</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"It was not until I had a personal audience with the 
new guild's representative that I realized the slaving market was... 
much better to the east.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">--Ali Qalar, Calishite slaver, from his new home in Mintar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Xanathar's Guild controls much of the illicit 
activity in and around Waterdeep from its base of operations in the 
subterranean city of Skullport. The guild has recently taken control of 
several portals hidden away in the caverns and tunnels, which has 
granted its operatives easier access to Waterdeep as well as allowed 
them to expand their activities beyond its borders. Not one to rush into
 new situations blind, the Xanathar commanded each of his eleven Masters
 to send him one of their finest operatives. These consummate rogues 
were tested for loyalty, prowess, and mental fortitude (the invasive 
psychological techniques used by the Xanathar disqualified several 
candidates and left them completely insane). </p>
<p align="LEFT">The eyes are drawn from all facets of the Xanathar's 
business, from smuggling and slavery to thievery and assassination. 
Despite their varied backgrounds, all of those chosen by the beholder 
lord are versed in the skills necessary to carry out his will. An eye is
 first and foremost a spy, gathering information in all of the areas in 
which the Xanathar has interests. The Xanathar also grants each eye some
 of his own powers so that they can carry out important assassinations 
and extortions, the details of which he might want to hide from even his
 most trusted Masters. Because of this, the eyes are distrusted or 
disliked by almost all of the Masters, but as the personal servants of 
the Xanathar they are beyond most plots.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There is no "leader" among the eleven; they are all 
independent agents. They do feel some loyalty to the group, however, and
 the most senior members are respected and given aid under most 
circumstance. The eyes are ranked in order of seniority, with the 
longest-serving member being known as the First Eye, the second longest 
the Second Eye, and so on. The Xanathar sees all of them equally, 
however, and does not become attached to any particular eye or enjoy a 
personal relationship with any of them. The guild is a business, and he 
and his minions treat it as such.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Xanathar oversees all missions that he gives to his 
eyes. Each eye reports directly to him, although frequent reports are 
not commanded so as to give the operatives enough freedom to quietly and
 thoroughly complete their duties. When the agents choose to work 
together, they must still accept individual responsibility for their 
current missions; the Xanathar has no patience for excuses. Once the 
Xanathar turns an agent loose, he expects to hear from him again only 
when his business has been conducted. He will not turn an eye with a 
legitimate need for help away, but he looks down upon those who must 
continually ask for emergency assistance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The previous Eleventh Eye, a drow assassin known as 
Korask Nevae, was guilty of failing to plan for missions and proved 
incapable of dealing with adversity on his own. The other eyes sensed 
this weakness and steered as clear of his missions as they could, 
despite their normally tight-knit relations. It did not take long for 
the Xanathar to tire of Korask's complaining and excuse making, and 
after one partially successful mission, the beholder ate the drow as an 
example. The eyes always warn new recruits that their independence is as
 much a leash as it is a freedom, and that it is better to go into debt 
with another eye than to risk being seen as weak by their master.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Korask's final mission was typical of what the eyes are 
expected to do. He was tasked with gathering information about the power
 brokers of Calimport's slave trade, their habits, their desires, and 
their fears. One trader in particular was of interest to the Xanathar, 
since it was well known that he smuggled young children from Waterdeep 
and its surrounding settlements in order to sell them to select clients 
around the Shining Sea.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Korask spent his first few days under the hot sun 
gathering contacts, some of which had been suggested by fellow eyes. He 
made contact with an ex-slave who proved all too willing to sell his 
fellows out to the "new interest," and soon had enough information to 
begin what he thought would be a wise repositioning of the Xanathar's 
Guild. Korask assassinated key slaves from each of the most powerful 
slave masters, a dire warning that a war might be brewing. He was 
careful to leave no trace of his identity, while spreading rumors that 
implicated the other slave masters in the killings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unfortunately for Korask, his plan went awry. The 
assassinations were skillfully done, but his clumsy attempts to spread 
rumors and misinformation led to his identification. He was forced to 
retreat through the portal back to Skullport, where he related his 
misadventure to the other eyes, and then to the Xanathar himself. Rather
 than granting Korask the aid of a more experienced eye, as he had in 
the past, the Xanathar paralyzed him and then ate him while several of 
the other eyes watched. The lesson has not been lost, and whoever 
becomes the next Eleventh Eye will be well warned against overstepping 
the bounds of his assigned tasks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Much loyalty exists between the various eyes, although 
some do carry old prejudices into their new positions, making some 
pairings unlikely at best. Besides the daily threat that is a function 
of their occupation, the eyes must be on guard from treacheries from the
 Masters of the Xanathar's businesses. For the most part those men have 
worked their entire lives for the Xanathar's Guild, and the idea that 
recruits from their own ranks would rise above them to become the 
Xanathar's personal servants does not sit well with some. While fear of 
the beholder's wrath or loyalty to the Guild often override these 
feelings of jealousy, some Masters are always on the lookout for a 
chance to undermine the eyes--especially the eye that came from his men.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition to these internal threats, the Rundeen and 
other notable trading factions have begun to take notice of the 
Xanathar's emergence into Calimport and Westgate. While nothing has come
 of this yet, it is quite possible that one of the eyes may be used as 
an example warning the Xanathar to take his business elsewhere.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>NPC Reactions</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Because secrecy is paramount to an eye's business, most 
NPCs are indifferent to the appearance of what they see as just another 
citizen among their ranks. Those who deal with an eye on a regular 
basis, whether they know their true identity or not, are generally 
friendly toward the eye--this especially holds true for contacts, who 
tend to be well paid and well treated in exchange for their information 
and material aid.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xanathar guildmembers and those on good terms with the 
guild in general will also be friendly toward the eyes, who carry 
symbols of high rank within the guild even without identifying 
themselves as the beholder's right hand men.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eye of the Xanathar Lore</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Characters with Knowledge (local Waterdeep) can research
 the Xanathar's Guild, and may even turn up some information about the 
eyes of the Xanathar. Add +10 to the DC for characters using Knowledge 
(local Calimport or Westgate). When a character makes a skill check, 
read or paraphrase the following, including the information from lower 
DCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC 10:</b> "The Xanathar's Guild has agents all around Waterdeep as well as deep beneath its surface."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC 15:</b> "It is said that the Xanathar's Guild has 
been seen in other cities to the south and east, but their purpose is as
 yet unknown."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC 20:</b> "The Xanathar uses special agents known 
only to him for his most delicate missions. These agents are well versed
 in all of the Guild's business, and have the authority to carry out 
their master's will."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC 30:</b> This level of information will net a 
character the name of at least one active eye in the area, and possibly 
contacts that can lead a character to the agent. Of course, the fact 
that this information has been leaked will likely get back to the eye as
 well, so it is in the character's best interest to make sure he finds 
the eye before the eye finds him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Attempting to make contact with an eye of the Xanathar 
requires a Gather Information check (DC 30), while contacting lesser 
guild members requires DC 20 in Waterdeep or DC 15 in Skullport. 
Contacting a lesser member does not guarantee contact with an eye, but 
it is a good place to start. Eyes of the Xanathar are not open to 
accepting outside jobs, or to sharing information with characters in 
exchange for money. A character will have to demonstrate a clear benefit
 to the Xanathar or the Guild in order to gain the temporary help of an 
eye.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eyes of the Xanathar in Your Game</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">An eye of the Xanathar can enter your game at any time. 
Due to their secretive nature, one might have been there all along, or 
at the very least have been so well disguised that the characters would 
not have known him for what he is. He might even be the driving force 
behind the characters' adventures, or may be gauging them as possible 
contacts, minions, or guild recruits.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Players who enjoy intrigues and NPC interaction will be 
attracted to this class for its utilization of both. The strange powers 
will appeal to players who like "strange" classes, or like to explore 
monstrous PCs. Make sure that an eye of the Xanathar in your game has 
plenty of time to find and cultivate contacts, and to perform missions 
that aid the guild in some way.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adaptation:</b> Eyes of the Xanathar are specific to a
 particular beholder that operates from Skullport, below Waterdeep, but 
any beholder cult in your game might have an elite team of spies or 
assassins.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Encounters:</b> Eyes of the Xanathar are rarely 
encountered by accident; more commonly, they make contact or allow 
themselves to be found so that they can initiate a relationship of some 
kind.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>EL 7</i>: Garag the Ninth Eye contacts the PCs to 
gather information for him about a wizard who is visiting Waterdeep for 
an annual conclave. If they are discovered, he may have to dispatch them
 in order to maintain his anonymity. If it comes to violence, Garag 
brings along a guild wizard (Wiz5 with an eyeball beholderkin familiar).</p>
