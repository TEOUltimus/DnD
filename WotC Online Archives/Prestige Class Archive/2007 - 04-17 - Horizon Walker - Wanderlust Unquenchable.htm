<p>This column aims to provide players with tips on creating effective 
and interesting characters of various types. Whether you're a beginning

looking to put some punch into an old standby, this column is for you. </p>
<p>Tireless travelers, horizon walkers (DMG 189) are always on the move,
 seeking out adventure and danger wherever they may be found.</p>
<h4>Assets</h4>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2004-17%20-%20Horizon%20Walker%20-%20Wanderlust%20Unquenchable_files/dnd_prc_20070417_hrznwlkr.jpg" alt="Horizon Walker" title="Horizon Walker" align="right" border="0" height="340" width="200"> The horizon walker has many useful abilities. Here are a few things to consider when building a horizon walker.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Good Base Attack Bonus: </b>A horizon walker's base attack bonus increases like that of a fighter, which is the best in the game.</li>
<li><b>Good Fortitude Saves: </b>Horizon walkers have good Fortitude saving throws (PH 22). Levels of ranger augment this further.</li>
<li><b>Good Skill Points: </b>Horizon walkers gain four skill points at 
every level, allowing them to increase a range of useful class skills 
including Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival.</li>
<li><b>Terrain Mastery: </b>At 1st- through 5th-level, horizon walkers 
gain terrain mastery. At each level, they choose an additional type of 
terrain (forest, hills, mountain, and so on) to master. Normally, this 
grants a +4 competence bonus to one type of skill check and a +1 insight
 bonus on attack and damage rolls to creatures from that terrain type. A
 notable exception to this is underground terrain mastery, which grants 
darkvision (or extends existing darkvision to 120 ft.) as well as 
granting the normal attack and damage bonuses.</li>
<li><b>Planar Terrain Master: </b>Skilled horizon walkers (6th-level or 
higher) get access to planar terrain master with every class level. 
Essentially, this is an improved version of terrain mastery that allows 
them to draw from a mystical connection they develop with the relevant 
plane. These abilities often grant a range of powers as well as 
(normally) an insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures
 native to the chosen plane.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<p>The horizon walker's advantages come at a price. Here are a few things to consider when thinking about such a character. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Poor Reflex Saves: </b>Horizon walkers have poor Reflex saving throws (PH 22). Levels of bard, ranger, or scout (<i>Complete Adventurer</i>) offset this to a certain degree.</li>
<li><b>Poor Will Saves: </b>Horizon walkers have poor Will saving throws (PH 22). Levels of bard offset this to a certain degree.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Playing a Horizon Walker</h4>
<p>People who play efficient horizon walkers should keep the following in mind. </p>
<p><b>Advancement and Build</b></p>
<p>Rangers, bards, and wizards can all qualify for this prestige class easily because they are the only classes from the <i>Player's Handbook </i>with
 Knowledge (geography) as a class skill. (Rangers have a significant 
advantage when qualifying for this class because they gain Endurance as a
 bonus feat at 3rd level). The scout (<i>Complete Adventurer</i>) also 
has Knowledge (geography) as a class skill, and so can easily qualify 
for horizon walker. Characters with Knowledge (geography) as a 
cross-class skill must wait until 13th level to qualify for this 
prestige class, making such individuals rare. It is for this reason that
 most horizon walkers have levels in bard, ranger, or scout. While 
wizards can qualify for this class, they rarely do so -- the lack of 
augmented spellcasting abilities seriously hinders their development. </p>
<p>Halflings often become horizon walkers because their nomadic lifestyle fits perfectly with the horizon walker's ethos. In the <i>World of Greyhawk</i>, many horizon walkers worship Fharlanghn, god of horizons, distance, travel, and roads. </p>
<p>Horizon walker has 10 class levels. Given that it is possible for a 
5th-level ranger to qualify for this prestige class, prospective horizon
 walkers must give some thought regarding what additional class levels 
to take. Scout and fighter are good choices, as are arcane archer, 
darkwood sniper (<i>Complete Warrior</i>), bloodhound, and highland stalker (both <i>Complete Adventurer</i>).</p>
<p><b>Feats, Skills, and Combat</b></p>
<p>The classes he took levels in to qualify for this prestige class 
defines a horizon walker's role in combat. He is rarely, however, a 
front-line combatant. Almost all horizon walkers have a good Dexterity 
score, because it is uniformly an important statistic for abilities 
granted by their previous class(es). Combined with an average or low hit
 point score and light armor, this means they normally prefer ranged 
combat over melee. Horizon walkers with levels in bard and scout are 
better suited to a supporting role in combat, while horizon 
walker/rangers often specialize in the archery combat style. (As 
archers, they should consider taking Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Far
 Shot, Shot on the Run, and so on.) Horizon walkers intent on entering 
melee should seriously consider wielding a rapier or light weapon and 
taking Weapon Finesse. </p>
<p>It is likely that a horizon walker will have one or more poor saving 
throws. (The exception to this is ranger/bards, who have good saving 
throws in all categories). He should cover such weaknesses by taking the
 relevant feats -- Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes. 
Stealthy is a good choice for those expecting to fill a scouting role, 
while Dodge and Mobility allow an archer specialist to disengage from 
combat without getting injured so often. </p>
<p><b>Equipment</b></p>
<p>Horizon walkers are attracted to items that improve their 
survivability as well as their scouting and reconnaissance skills. Thus,
 they find <i>cloaks of elvenkind, boots of elvenkind, gauntlets of dexterity, eyes of the eagle</i>, and so on particularly attractive. </p>
<p>They likely wear light armor so as not to restrict class abilities 
and skills gained from previous classes. Many wear (at the least) 
masterwork studded leather armor because of its lack of an armor check 
penalty, while those that can afford it buy a mithral shirt or suit of 
elven chain. Horizon walkers/archer specialists use a buckler, but 
others should invest in a shield. Once their armor is enchanted, the <i>shadow</i> and <i>silent moves</i> special abilities aid stealthy scouting while the <i>arrow deflection </i>ability added to their buckler or shield offers additional protection from ranged attacks. </p>
<p>Because horizon walkers spend most of their time traveling, they 
often purchase items that ease their travels and improve their mobility.
 Good examples of these include <i>bags of holding, quivers of Ehlonna, slippers of spider climbing, decanters of endless water</i>, and the various <i>Quaal's feather tokens</i>. From the <i>Magic Item Compendium</i>, horizon walkers often purchase such seemingly minor (but jolly useful) items as <i>everfull mugs, everlasting feedbags, everlasting rations, field provisions boxes</i>, and <i>Daern's instant tent</i>.</p>
