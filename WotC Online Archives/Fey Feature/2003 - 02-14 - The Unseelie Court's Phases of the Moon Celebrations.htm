<p class="size2">While the Seelie Court celebrates the turning of the 
seasons, the Unseelie Court chooses the phases of the Moon as the focus 
of its merry-making. Much more comfortable with the shadows of the 
night, they feel a special kinship with the cold and harsh lunar 
mistress. These celebrations are sometimes a parody of the pomp and 
elegance of the Seelie Court, sometimes homage to their own twisted 
states of being, and at all times a chance to enjoy the misery of 
unfortunate "honored guests." </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Festival of the Blood Moon</b></p>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">When the unfortunate fey formed their own court, they 
took the traditions of the Seelie Court and twisted them to fit a more 
macabre sense of self. Hence the Festival of the Blood Moon, a version 
of the Seelie's Fall Equinox festival, has been celebrated nearly as 
long as the Fall Equinox itself. </p>
<p class="size2">Like its Seelie counterpart, the Festival of the Blood 
Moon centers on a grand hunt, presided over by the Master or Mistress of
 the Hunt. This person, appointed by the queen from among the most 
skillful Dark Hunters (see next month's article), is responsible for 
choosing the quarry. Generally, it is a humanoid from another realm who 
has been first tortured to the point of insanity, then enhanced with <i>camouflage, quickness</i>,
 and other spells to make it difficult to catch. Preparations for the 
festival require many weeks, as members of the Unseelie Court who wish 
to increase their standing seek suitable prey to offer to the Mistress 
of the Hunt. If their prey is chosen and provides a particularly 
stimulating hunt, they may even receive a small gift from the queen 
herself.</p>
<p class="size2">The Unseelie Court holds this seven-day gala beneath 
the oldest tree in the forest. The dark fey cast numerous magical spells
 (many Evil) upon this tree, and at the end of the gala the tree is 
chopped down and burned in a huge bonfire. The remaining charcoal fuses 
into a solid disc the size of a fist. Upon command, the lump of charred 
wood becomes a <i>forcecage</i>. The winner of the hunt receives the 
cage, which, the spells having rendered the wood nearly invincible and 
invisible, can be used to catch all kinds of creatures unaware.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blood Moon <i>Forcecage</i>:</b> This lump of charcoal transforms into an immobile cubical prison (per the <i>forcecage</i>
 spell) when the correct command is uttered. The cage can take either 
shape described by the spell; the utterer of the command word determines
 the shape when activating the <i>blood moon forcecage.</i> This item can be used only once.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 13th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>forcecage</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 33,350 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Ceremony of the Dark Moon</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Ceremony of the Dark Moon is held every four 
hundred and thirteenth year. The 41-day event is the most highly 
regarded by the Unseelie Court, for during this time two important 
astrological phenomenon occur simultaneously.</p>
<p class="size2">First, the comet Sharani Kel appears. Its orbit brings 
it close enough to be seen in both the day and night sky for forty days.
 Lying low on the horizon, its trailing asteroids and galactic dust 
create the effect of a red claw ripping a gash in the fabric of the 
universe. </p>
<p class="size2">During this event, the fey druids offer sacrifices of 
rare creatures, one for each of the elements (fire, water, earth and 
air) each day, thanking the deities for the fey's long life and health. 
The ceremony takes place at the ruins in the center of a large crater. 
The fey believe that the crater, caused by a bolt from the sky that 
destroyed the stone dwellings of an ancient religious order that had 
fallen into apostasy, was a warning from the deities against forgetting 
who granted the fey their powers. Each member of the fey is expected to 
bring a memento that is valuable to him or her, and cast it into the 
fire at the center of the ruins. </p>
<p class="size2">On the last day of the ceremony, the moon travels in 
front of the sun, causing the land to grow dark around midday for about 
an hour. During this time, parents bring their offspring to be blessed 
by the chief druid. As faerie births are rare, even among the less 
discriminating fey of the Unseelie Court, there are generally no more 
than seven children brought forward. Each child receives a small <i>vial of blackest night</i> on a leather cord. This vial, when opened, causes the land to darken while still allowing the wearer sight.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Vial of Blackest Night:</b> Once per day, speaking a command word causes this vial to activate a <i>deeper darkness</i>
 effect that functions per the spell, except the vial has no effect upon
 its holder's vision. Only one person at a time can hold a vial and gain
 the benefits of seeing through the spell. The vial does not grant the 
ability to see through other <i>deeper darkness</i> spells.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>darkvision, deeper darkness</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 5,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Festival of the Waning Moon</b></p>
<p class="size2">Gaining sustenance mainly from the fruit of the land, 
the Unseelie Court places vital importance on the success of the crops 
each year. Indeed, the popularity of the queen among her people and her 
ability to rule effectively are directly related to the harvest.</p>
<p class="size2">The Festival of the Waning Moon takes place at winter 
solstice. Held amidst the barren branches of the Queen's Orchard, the 
gala involves five days of feasting and gift-giving. Each member of the 
court brings gifts to the queen in keeping with his or her material 
success during the last eleven months. As all fey wish to be respected 
by their peers, as well as seek to make their rivals look bad, gift 
values can far outweigh any gains during the year. In addition, 
expensive, rare or extremely elegant and fragile gifts are given to 
friends and acquaintances, all in efforts to increase in standing within
 the court.</p>
<p class="size2">On the last day of the gala, the shortest day of the 
year, the queen walks to the center of the grove. There she pricks her 
forefinger with a dagger. Nine drops of blood fall to the ground; the 
queen is thought to be replenishing the health of the soil with her own 
life force. If the crop for the next year is good, then the life force 
of the queen is strong. If not. . . .</p>
<p class="size2">Next, the queen is given five small stones, upon each of which she smears a drop of blood. She places these <i>briar blood stones</i>
 into a small pouch and gives it to the fey whose gift most delighted 
her. To be used during times of pursuit, each stone can cause a wall of 
stone briars 10 feet thick to block the way, effectively keeping people 
either out or in.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Briar Blood Stone: </b>Throwing down the stone causes a <i>wall of thorns</i> to spring up per the spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 9th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>wall of thorns</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 2,250 gp (per stone); <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The New Moon Celebration</b></p>
<p class="size2">The New Moon Celebration occurs during the week of the 
first new moon of summer. This seven-day carnival of games, feasts and 
hunts takes place around the Ellaurial Lake, a mountain lake of glacial 
depths. The moon's reflection across the water causes the surrounding 
shore to glow an icy blue. </p>
<p class="size2">Each night, small boats built and decorated with 
flowers, feathers, rich cloth and glowing globes of light, sail across 
the lake for the amusement of the court. The Master of the Masquerade 
bestows prizes nightly to the sailors of the boats that gain the most 
accolades from shore watchers.</p>
<p class="size2">In the middle of the week, a masquerade ball is held on
 floating pavilions in the center of the lake. Fey use special potions 
or spells that enable them to become creatures of great oddity. Some 
more daring fey even create potions that turn them into creatures that 
have never existed or combine many features from a variety of animals 
and plants. The queen awards a <i>pendant of true sight</i> for her 
favorite costume. This pendant allows the wearer to see through any 
disguise, charms, and spells to perceive the true nature of others. It 
lasts until the next New Moon Celebration, at which time it loses its 
special abilities and reverts back to a sliver, leaf-shaped pendant 
carved from jade.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Pendant of True Sight:</b> Upon speaking a command word, the wearer of this necklace can see as though affected by a <i>true seeing </i>spell. Each pendant has 10 uses before it becomes a pretty but nonmagical gem worth 1,000 gp.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 9th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>true seeing</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 11,500 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
