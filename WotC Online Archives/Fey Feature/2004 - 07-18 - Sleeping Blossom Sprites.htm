<p align="left"><i>From a record of correspondence between Lallnik 
Elljin, Royal Court Horticulturist for the Queen of Air and Light, and 
Janisk Elljin:</i></p>
<p align="left">My dear great-great-nephew Janisk,</p>
<p align="left">I was pleased to learn of your appointment as the Head 
of Gardens for the family lands. I remember quite fondly designing those
 gardens when I was in only my fourth century. Your cousin-by-bond twice
 removed, Tunaka, succeeded me when I was called to tend the queen's 
gardens. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2007-18%20-%20Sleeping%20Blossom%20Sprites_files/fey_Trumpet_flower.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="240" width="230">I
 confess to continued disappointment in having left the care of our 
family lands to one so lacking in talent. My heart broke upon 
discovering that the sapphire trees had died, and all the sprites had 
left. I had spent fifty years building a stable sprite population. Now 
that Tunaka has left for the mortal planes, I trust you will work hard 
to restore beauty and fame to the Elljin Gardens. As for your questions 
concerning which type of garden sprites to cultivate, I believe I can 
offer some advice.</p>
<p align="left">One of the most difficult, yet rewarding, varieties of garden sprites to breed are the sleeping blossom sprites, or genus <i>flora sophoria</i>.
 They have a good feel for plants. Many a time they warned me when one 
of their favorite flowers was fighting disease and helped me save it.</p>
<p align="left">The sleeping blossom sprite can be distinguished from 
its relatives, the starlight sprite and the morning rose mallow sprite, 
by its coloring. Sleeping blossom sprites tend to have pale skin, with 
red- or orange-tinted wings. Starlight sprites are vibrant blue- or 
violet-skinned, with florescent wings. Morning sprites have a dark brown
 coloring, with green mottled wings. They tend to blend in to their 
surroundings, making them less desirable. If you are going to cultivate a
 sprite, you want it to be one of the showpieces of your garden. Many 
horticulturists shy away from them due to their volatile nature, but 
their rarity makes them all the more prized, in my opinion.</p>
<p align="left">Sleeping Blossom sprites are attracted to flowering plants with large, bright petals. I recommend the <i>begonia semperflorens</i>, or the <i>nicotiana alata grandiflora</i>. These plants will each sustain three to five sprites. The <i>begonia semperflorens</i>
 has strong, waxy petals with hues varying from azure to crimson. The 
color, in particular, along with the light, sweet fragrance, seems to 
attract the sprites. This plant is also hardy, and with careful tending,
 can bloom all year round. <i>Nicotiana alata grandiflora</i> have 
trumpet-shaped flowers that close during the evening and during 
rainstorms. Their colors range from chartreuse to lavender, so they 
should match whatever color scheme you choose for that section. These 
plants are more susceptible to infestations, so you will need to watch 
them carefully.</p>
<p align="left">Once an ideal environment has been created, there are 
two ways to acquire a sprite population -- neither, unfortunately, 
perfect. The first, and the most tenuous, is to attempt capturing wild 
sleeping blossom sprites and transplanting them into your garden. One 
highly recommend method suggests capturing them at night and keeping 
them contained with wind-based spells. However, if you do not gather up 
the entire swarm (and there is no way of knowing whether you have them 
all), when they wake up they go on a rampage, destroying your garden and
 injuring any creatures in their path as they try to find their missing 
members. </p>
<p align="left">A safer but much more costly way is to have a <i>sympathy</i>
 spell cast. This attracts any sprites in the area to your garden. If 
they find it acceptable, they stay. The drawback is that you may have to
 cast it many times before you attract the right type of sprite. Driving
 off unwanted starlight or morning sprites requires much work: Once the 
spell has ended, they must be caught and released back into the wild.</p>
<p align="left">Once you have your swarm of sprites, it is best to 
cordon off that area of the garden for several years. Contact with the 
queen of the swarm should not be attempted for at least a decade. During
 this time, you should regularly supply honey and fragrant herbs to the 
sprite community. Sleeping Blossom sprites require some time to settle 
in. If they are disturbed, they will either react violently or leave. Be
 sure you never allow an open flame anywhere near the sprites for they 
hate fire above all.</p>
<p align="left">Sleeping blossom sprites can be dangerous if provoked to
 attack. They cause a great deal of damage and have an ability that 
makes their victims sleep, which can prove most inconvenient when 
fighting or trying to escape from a swarm. The unwary gardener may be 
injured if he should annoy the swarm, but with a few precautions, the 
dangers can be minimized. First, try casting a <i>sanctuary</i> spell 
before you enter the garden. I would use this precaution for the first 
several years, or until the queen of the swarm has accepted you. If the 
spell does not work, have a skillful bard accompany you while gardening.
 A bard's <i>fascination</i> ability usually has a calming, almost 
tranquilizing effect on the sprites. (Of course, make sure your bard 
companion is not especially favored at court, in case the sprites 
attack.) When soothed by music, my sleeping blossom sprites liked to 
gather around and watch me work. </p>
<p align="left">Once you have a thriving, stable sleeping blossom sprite
 population, your garden is ready for parties and showings. (Do not 
forget the centennial judging that is coming up in three decades. While I
 was head gardener, we never failed to place.) Happy sprites allow 
visitors to watch their frolicking, and may even offer a short 
performance for your guests. Their lively dances and light displays in 
the evening hours are always a crowd pleaser, and make your garden the 
talk at court.</p>
<p align="left">I trust this advice will help you, dear nephew. I expect
 to be home for Aunt Illisu's 700th birthday celebration in five years. I
 look forward to seeing what you have done with the family lands.</p>

<p align="left"><i>Miniature faeries flit among the flowers.</i></p>
<p align="left">A single sleeping blossom sprite looks like a miniature humanoid with translucent wings. It stands only a handspan tall.</p>
<p align="left">Sleeping blossom sprites speak Sylvan.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">A sleeping blossom sprite swarm seeks to surround and 
attack any creature it perceives as a threat, especially one bearing an 
open flame or other obvious threat to its garden home.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Deep Slumber (Su):</b> A sleeping blossom sprite 
swarm attack often causes creatures to fall asleep. Any living creature 
that begins its turn with a sleeping blossom sprite swarm in its space 
must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be affected as though by a <i>deep slumber</i> spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swarm Traits:</b><i></i>A swarm has no clear front or
 back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits 
or flanking. A swarm comprising Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune 
to all weapon damage.</p>
<p align="left">Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the 
swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade
 its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or 
reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, 
grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.</p>
<p align="left">A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>),
 with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an 
intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a -10 penalty on 
saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as 
many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack 
does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead. </p>
<p align="left">Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a <i>gust of wind</i>
 spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, 
treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent 
creatures. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of subdual damage to the swarm 
per spell level (or Hit Die of the originating creature, in the case of 
effects such as an air elemental's whirlwind).</p>
<p align="left">A swarm rendered unconscious by means of subdual damage 
becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit 
points exceed its subdual damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Distraction (Ex):</b> Any living creature vulnerable 
to the swarm's damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is
 nauseated for 1 round; a DC 15 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even 
with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within 
the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell 
level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration requires a 
Concentration check (DC 20). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
