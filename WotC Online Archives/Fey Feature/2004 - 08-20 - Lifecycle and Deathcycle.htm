<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="590">
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="LEFT">Most mortals see life as a straight line. You are born, 
beginning the line. You live your chosen path, and then you die: the end
 of the line. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A few, more philosophical, souls realize that life more 
closely resembles a circle than a line, with birth joining together with
 death to complete the cycle. Very rare mortals understand that life is 
not just one circle, but rather a series of endless, interlocking 
circles, many of whose circumferences an individual will not live long 
enough to traverse.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fey, on the other hand, with their millennia-long 
lifespans, see life and time as cyclical. Cycles, like the seasons of 
nature or the phases of the moon, surround one's destiny. At every 
point, one is beginning a circle, ending a circle, and traveling around 
the midpoint of countless other circles. Birth is just the beginning of 
one such circle. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Love, loss, betrayal, honor, fame, friendship: A true 
fey knows that each one of these begins a cycle and ends a cycle. One 
might have his honor held in the grasp of a rival, only to later hold 
the honor of an enemy in his hands. One might betray a friend, only to 
find herself, decades later, betrayed by a friend. These small circles 
join with the larger circle: the rise and fall of houses, the birth and 
death of gods and planets and planes. All part of circles that even the 
oldest fey will admit they do not begin to know or understand, or hope 
to live long enough to see completed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>When Fey are Immortal</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In a campaign where fey are immortal, they disregard the
 prospect of a natural death. Their births are the beginning of an 
endless spiral of emotional highs and lows, triumphs and failures.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>An Untimely End</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2008-20%20-%20Lifecycle%20and%20Deathcycle_files/fey_20040820_707165.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="123" width="250">Unnatural
 deaths occasionally occur among the fey. An accident in the wilds or a 
misstep in the mortal realms are unusual, but expected every century or 
two. The death of a fey at the hands of another fey is rare. It is 
common, during travels to other planes, for fey to take part in raids or
 adventures that cause the death of a mortal; for the most part, those 
are overlooked, as mortals are not considered to possess the same level 
of sentience as the fey. But murder amongst the fey is nearly unheard 
of.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are several possible reasons for this unspoken 
taboo. The first is that the strict punishment imposed upon a fey 
committing such a crime is strong enough to deter most attempts. Indeed,
 any fey responsible for a death, even inadvertently, can expect not 
only to be punished as an individual, but also to have his or her entire
 house dishonored for a several millennia. Most times, committing murder
 results in the fey becoming an outcast from his or her family, stripped
 of name and status. If the death was accidental, the fey may be 
banished from the fey realms until a new queen takes the throne. If the 
death was premeditated, the fey can be given to the bereaved family for 
enslavement and torture. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Another potential reason for the rarity of murder is 
that fey generally prefer humiliation with a good dose of violence to 
lethal force. With careful planning, revenge over a slight can be 
enjoyed for centuries,. The monotony of endless days can be filled with 
schemes, whispers and delicious thoughts of one's enemy twisting on the 
end of a string like a puppet forced to dance. Death, in its finality, 
brings only a quick release. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, the worries of the fey concerning their small
 numbers also increase the value of every fey life. With low birth rates
 making new children a rarity, many petty squabbles that might lead 
mortals to kill are never considered possible justifications for murder 
among the fey. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>When Fey are Mortal</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Life is a beautiful symmetry, to be celebrated and 
embraced. And among the rarest and most celebrated cycles of the fey, is
 the final journey of an elder fey.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2008-20%20-%20Lifecycle%20and%20Deathcycle_files/fey_20040820_412380.JPG" border="1" align="right" height="184" width="250">Death,
 natural death, when it comes for the fey, is neither fast, nor 
surprising. A fey can tell -- through seers, through the feeling of his 
skin as it thins over his bones, through the dreams of the moon on a 
cold winter night -- that death will come in another several decades. 
This short time left is spent in transferring wisdom, history and 
knowledge to the next generation of the family and in celebrating the 
events of life. Feasts, dances, and months-long celebrations held at the
 family's lands are all part of the last days. If the elder fey is in 
good standing at the court, the queen herself may arrange for a party in
 his honor, or the planting of a garden that will forever bear his name.
 </p>
<p align="LEFT">In the final weeks, a scribe is commissioned to sit with
 the fey and listen to the story of his life. This written history is 
added to the family treasures, as it is considered the essence of the 
person: all the good and bad done over a lifetime, all the cycles 
delineated with pen and paper. Because of the longevity of the fey, even
 the largest of families possess only a few hundred volumes at most.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2008-20%20-%20Lifecycle%20and%20Deathcycle_files/fey_20040820_705867.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="195" width="250">After
 the last party has ended and last song of honor has been sung, the 
elder is ready to depart. Any personal magic items are passed to the 
younger generation, to be used for the good of the family. Ceremonial 
robes are donned, and a solemn procession glides into the forest. A 
favorite granddaughter or great-great-great nephew is chosen to spend 
the final hours alone with elder fey. Seated in a circle of flowers, 
trees or stones, they spend the last hours together until the moon rises
 full overhead. In the morning, the young fey comes back alone, and the 
elder is gone forever.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Rite of Ultimate Passage</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When death approaches, a fey may choose to undergo a 
complex rite to pass on her knowledge to her heirs. The ceremony is both
 time-consuming and costly: It takes a week to complete and costs 1,000 
gp per participant (including the elder fey).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The <i>rite of ultimate passage</i> must be undertaken 
willingly by a fey with at least 10 Hit Dice or class levels or any 
combination of the two that totals 10 or more. She declares that upon 
her death, her chosen heirs will benefit from her knowledge. For every 5
 ranks in a Knowledge skill, she can grant an heir a +1 bonus in that 
Knowledge skill. The bequest functions only if the fey dies of old age.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The recipient need not be a fey. No individual may 
receive or possess bonuses totaling more than +2. If the individual 
later becomes an heir to another fey, the beneficiary decides which 
bonuses to keep. Once a recipient refuses or gives up a bonus, it is 
forever lost.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, Elodoria, an ancient matriarch, has 13 
ranks each of Knowledge (arcana) and 17 ranks of Knowledge (nature). She
 may choose to honor up to 5 individuals with the gift of some of her 
knowledge. (Thirteen ranks of Knowledge [arcana] provide 3 points of 
bonus on Knowledge [arcana] checks that Elodoria can distributed. 
Seventeen ranks of Knowledge [nature] provide 3 points of Knowledge 
[nature] bonus that can be gifted.) Elodoria chooses to give a +2 bonus 
to Knowledge (arcana) to her favorite niece, Adrianna. She gives her 
dear friend M'hele a +1 bonus in both Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge 
(nature). She decides that no one else is worthy of the talent she can 
bestow. The old fey continues to live another decade. Both Adrianna and 
M'hele now have as many bonuses as they are allowed from death rites. 
When Elodoria dies, Adrianna gains her bequest: a +2 bonus on Knowledge 
(arcana) checks. M'hele had been the recipient of another bequest and 
already possesses a +2 bonus on Knowledge (history) checks at the time 
that Elodoria dies. M'hele chooses to keep a +1 bonus on Knowledge 
(history) and add the +1 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks left to her 
by her friend. The +1 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks from Elodoria 
is lost, as is the +1 bonus on Knowledge (history) checks that M'hele 
gave up.</p>
