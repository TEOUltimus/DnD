<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">We know that you're curious, excited, and concerned about what's going on behind the scenes in the preparation of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 3.5. The last thing we want is for anyone to lose sleep over this 
(unless it's because you stayed up too late playing the game). Adequate 
rest is essential to good health. In an effort to promote healthy 
gaming, therefore, we're going to present weekly answers to some of the 
most-asked questions about <b>D&amp;D</b> 3.5. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Our guest physician is Ed Stark, RpD (doctor of roleplaying) and <b>D&amp;D</b> design manager. We'll be talking to Ed a lot over the next few months -- as much as his patience allows. </span></p>

</tr>
<tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q:
 I'm nervous about the label "3.5." It implies that this upgrade will 
move us halfway toward a completely new version 4.0. Why was this number
 chosen, as opposed to 3.01 or 3.1?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#000000;">A: We actually talked about this quite a bit. We feel the changes we're making to the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 RPG are important enough to warrant the "3.5" label, but not nearly 
significant enough to be a 4th edition. We also want to send the message
 that this is an upgrade, not a new edition. Whether we're "halfway" to a
 new edition, I couldn't say. I will say that I would have a hard time 
backing any upgrade beyond this that wasn't a new edition. A "3.1" label
 might imply there could be a bunch more upgrades before 4.0, and we 
don't want to imply that at all.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Will there be a rebate program for previous owners who buy the new books?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#000000;">A:
 Not to my knowledge. Your 3.0 rulebooks should work very well with any 
support product that is post-3.5, and vice versa. The older books won't 
be useless, but they won't be perfectly up to date, either; there will 
be changes. Anyone who wants to investigate the changes before 
purchasing new books can download the upgraded SRD. You can do that for 
free.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: What will be the new page counts?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#000000;">A: All three core books will be 320 pages.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Will the books have better bindings?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#000000;">A: I hope so. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px; color:#000000;">We
 thought that the books had great bindings to start with, and we were 
dismayed to hear that the second printing of the PH had lower-quality 
bindings than the first printing. My books have held up well, and I use 
them literally every day (and night) as part of my job. Still, we're 
going to make sure the 3.5 books have the best bindings we possibly can.<br></span><br></p>

</tr>
<tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Will existing characters be easily and instantly portable to 3.5 rules?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 Easily, yes. Instantly -- depends on what you want to do. NPCs and 
monsters from existing products can be run right out of the original 
books with few or no changes necessary. They won't be 100% "3.5," but 
they will be compatible. I just ran an adventure composed entirely of 
3.0 monsters, and I was able to convert on the fly.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Players
 and DMs who want "true precision" probably should spend a few minutes 
upgrading. I play a 17th-level druid in one game. It took me less than 
10 minutes to make every change to the character needed to make him 100%
 3.5-compatible. I'm familiar with the revisions, of course, but the 
druid is one of the classes with the most revisions to it. Considering 
that, 10 minutes for a 17th-level character isn't rough at all.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Are any spells changing level?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/gimble_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="392" width="290">A:
 Yes, but we tried to keep that to a minimum. If we had a 6th-level 
spell that was overpowered or underpowered, we felt it would do much 
less damage to the system to make the spell fit its 6th-level slot 
rather than move it up or down the list. I think people will be much 
happier with the way the spells interact. When we did move a spell up or
 down in level, we tried to fill the gaps with new spells. The new <i>Player's Handbook</i> has even more spells than the old one, if you can believe it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Will there be any new iconic characters? Will any of the old ones go away?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 None of the old iconics will go away, but we will have at least one new
 one. This isn't a huge issue -- we already have more iconics than 
classes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Can we see this new character?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: Here he is courtesy of <b>D&amp;D </b>Art Director Dawn Murin -- Gimble, a gnome bard, by illustrator Wayne Reynolds.<br></span><br></p>

</tr>
<tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#990000; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Q: Will skill descriptions state explicitly whether you can take 10 or 20?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: We took a page from <i>d20 Modern</i> and <b>Star Wars</b>
 there, but we broadened our approach. The 3.0 rules already state that 
you can take 10 on skills only when you're not under duress (unless you 
have a particular character ability). We've made that more clear and 
provided better examples. So, you can take 10 when riding down a road 
(on your Ride check, of course) and the ground suddenly becomes very 
uneven, but you can't take 10 in those same circumstances with goblins 
firing crossbows at you. As for taking 20, again the rules pretty 
specifically state when you can and can't take 20. If there's a skill 
that has a penalty for failure, you can't take 20, since taking 20 means
 you'd roll every number, 1-20, in two minutes. Other skills have "you 
know it or you don't" answers, like Knowledge, and you can't take 20 on 
them, either. Finally, skills that take longer than 1 round to 
accomplish don't allow you to take 20 (at least, not usually), as taking
 20 takes, well, twenty tries, or two minutes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: What other changes in <b>D&amp;D</b> came about as a result of work on <i>d20 Modern</i> and the <b>Star Wars</b> game? </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: We learned a lot from <i>d20 Modern</i>, the <b>Star Wars</b> RPG, and even material published by other d20 companies. You'll definitely notice some <i>d20 Modern</i> "elements" in 3.5, but you'll see places where we diverged, too. <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>
 has its own needs in terms of game mechanics. We won't force things 
together that just don't fit, but we'll take advantage of evolving rules
 development as much as possible.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: That wasn't very specific. Why are you being so stingy with information?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: Context, development, and delivery. We don't like to give away "teasers" or bits of information that lead to <i>misinformation</i>. When we put up the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=rpga/articles/baatezustats">pit fiend's stats</a></span><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">,
 for example, it turned into a furor as people tried to extrapolate 
revision elements from the stats. We were prepared to discuss those 
elements in more detail -- DR will be featured in an upcoming <i><b><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=/leaving.asp?url=http://paizopublishing.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_rs_archive1">Dragon</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://paizopublishing.com/dragon.shtml"> Magazine</a></i></span><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">article, for example, and I've answered other questions involving monster stats.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">What
 we don't want is for people to get upset from drawing incorrect 
conclusions, from reading someone else's incorrect conclusions, or from 
seeing material from us that isn't fully developed. Let's face it, 
folks, we're still working on this. If we could release all the 
information now, we'd do it in the form of three hardcover books, but we
 aren't done.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Case
 in point: Many people noticed that the pit fiend stats had no CR 
rating. Some of them jumped on that to declare that we're scrapping the 
Challenge Rating system. In fact, we didn't include a CR because we 
weren't sure yet what the pit fiend's CR should be. Rather than release 
the wrong number, we left it off. A few people drew the wrong 
conclusions and stirred up a firestorm of controversy. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">We like to learn from our mistakes. As things <i>get finished</i>, we'll release samples for everyone to examine and comment on, and we'll keep the work-in-progress under wraps.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: Anything like that you can let us see right now?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: Well, here's a new feat, Manyshot, along with the sketch of its illustration.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/rs_manyshot_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="199" width="297"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Manyshot [General]</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">You can fire multiple arrows as a single attack against a nearby target.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Prerequisites: </b>Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Benefit: </b>As
 a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 
30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack roll (with a -4 penalty) to 
determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">For
 every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add 
one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a 
base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a 
cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total of -6 on the third
 arrow and -8 on the fourth).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Special: </b>Regardless
 of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage 
(such as sneak attack damage) only once. If you score a critical hit, 
only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal 
regular damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as 
having Manyshot even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but 
only when he is wearing light or no armor.</span></p>

<tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: Do the people designing the games read the bulletin boards and forums and take those comments seriously?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 We read the message boards constantly. We try to take the comments 
seriously, but there are so many comments that we need to scan them 
pretty quickly. Anything that looks abusive or badly reasoned gets 
largely ignored. Personally, I spend about an hour a day reading our 
message boards and surfing the rest of the web. Other members of the RPG
 R&amp;D team spend similar amounts of time online.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: Why was the beast type removed from the creature list?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 It was redundant and confusing. Originally, the animal type was for 
real-world animals. The beast type was for nonmagical but nonexistent 
creatures. The magical beast type was for fanciful, magical creatures. 
That sounded good, but then we started wondering why dinosaurs, which 
did exist, were beasts right alongside griffons, which we're pretty sure
 didn't. What if an existing animal became extinct? Would that shift it 
from being an animal to a beast? Why could druids and various spells 
that affect animals not affect dinosaurs or other "natural" beasts just 
because we didn't want them to affect fanciful ones?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">In
 the end, we answered a lot of questions by putting real-world critters 
(along with their extinct and dire cousins) in with the animals they 
were most like. Those few fanciful beasts went into the magical beast 
category.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: You revised the <i>Monster Manual</i>. Will the <i>Monster Manual II</i> also be revised at some point?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: Maybe, but I expect we can handle the "revision" to the <i>Monster Manual II</i> with a web article. It won't need much adjusting.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#990000; font-size:12px;">Q: Will this revision eventually lead to updated versions of <i>Oriental Adventures</i>, <i>Manual of the Planes</i>, <i>Epic Level Handbook</i>, <i>Forgotten Realms</i>, or any of the other hardcover books that I bought in lieu of food and life-saving medication? </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: I knew people who used to sell blood to pay their rent. When they went to <b>Gen Con</b>,
 they'd debate whether to pay rent that month or buy the newest game 
releases. I expect they eventually got kicked out of their apartment. 
Oh, well -- you can play games pretty much anywhere.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">We
 don't anticipate revising any of those books. In most cases, it just 
isn't necessary -- the necessary updates will either be intuitive or 
simple things we can make people aware of through the website. In the 
spirit of never saying never, I suppose it's possible that certain 
material might need more extensive updating and that we might revise a 
particularly important or popular subject, but we'd rather focus our 
effort on providing new material.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: That depends on what you care about. The fact that we went through the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 and tightened up the CRs is pretty important to me. (I DM a lot.) I 
also play a druid, and I really like the changes that were made to the 
druid's spell lists and wild shape ability. I think the most important

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 Again, this really depends on what you care about. As a 
most-of-the-time-DM, I think the changes to the monsters will have the 
largest positive impact on the game. We worked hard to make monsters 
easier for DMs to play, modify, and create. We made the monsters fit 
their CRs better (or moved their CRs to where they do fit), and we 
really tried hard to fill in the gaps where monsters had obvious 
problems everyone was noticing and complaining about.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 That's tough. I like a lot of things, both as a player and as a DM. I 
really like the retooling we've done with the damage reduction system. 
It's an interesting and meaningful thing, now, which is what it was 
intended to be all along. I like the tweaks made to the classes. We had 
places in 3.0 where classes missed what players wanted them to be and 
3.5 addresses those problems. As both a player and a DM, I like it when 
characters can follow the rules and still come out just the way players 
want. We're getting closer to that goal with 3.5.</span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="570"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This week we look at things that <i>won't</i>
 be changing from 3 to 3.5. In real terms, that's most of the game, but 
people still worry about their favorite features. Here are just a few 
important points of continuity between the new and the not-quite-as-new 
versions of <b>D&amp;D.</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Have there been any changes to alignment?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A: No.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Skills?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A:
 No changes in the way they're used. Roll a d20, add your modifier, and 
compare to DC. Some of those DCs are changing, either up or down 
depending on specifics. Most DCs didn't need adjustment. We tried 
generally to provide more examples based on player feedback.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Initiative?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A: No changes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Multiclassing?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A:
 No changes to the way it works, but some of the classes have been 
rebalanced to avoid front-loading of abilities. The ranger, for example,
 no longer gets all the best abilities at 1st level. The changes 
encourage multiclassing characters to gain more than one level in each 
class. That might make multiclassing less attractive to aggressive 
min-maxers, but then, that was the idea. It's still a great character 
option, but one with fewer opportunities for cherry picking.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: <b>Greyhawk</b> deities?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A: They're still the default pantheon.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Page design?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/rs_blackguard_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="318" width="232">A:
 There will be no significant change to the look of the books, aside 
from some new art, like the new blackguard illustration by Sam Wood, and
 of course, new covers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Philosophy?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A:
 Some people might consider this to be a minor or obvious point, but we 
think it's important to state it emphatically. The philosophy that forms
 the game's foundation hasn't changed in any way. What's being done is 
mostly clarifying things that weren't explained well and fixing things 
that didn't work well. Our philosophy hasn't changed, so neither has the
 game's. We've had three years and millions of hours of consumer use to 
identify where we could have done a better job of implementing that 
philosophy. If anything, the changes are designed to bring the game 
closer to our original philosophy in those areas where we didn't achieve
 our ideal, not to push it in some other direction. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Is anything being done to half-orcs and half-elves?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: Many of the races in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 received minor changes, but both half-orcs and half-elves are extremely
 popular as PCs. If we changed them significantly (particularly the 
half-orc, which is a very powerful and popular PC race) we would do a 
disservice to fans of those races and the revision.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#990000">Q: Have the core classes become any more flexible, or is that still the province of prestige classes, feats, and multiclassing?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A:
 That's an interesting question. I'd say the core classes have always 
been more flexible than the prestige classes, but those are becoming 
more flexible now, too. The monk and some of the other "narrow" core 
classes gain a few more choices. Having more feats to choose from also 
increases the opportunities for customization.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Combat is one of the most important and most complex aspects of the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Designers want to keep things simple and clean while players 
constantly strive to push the envelope and stretch the boundaries of 
both what's allowed and what's possible. In <b>D&amp;D</b> 3.5, the 
designers have pulled off a real-life feat of their own in the way 
they're streamlining the combat chapter and making the rules easier to 
understand.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" color:#990000">Q: How have attacks of opportunity changed?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 They haven't, really, but the rules have been clarified. Attacks of 
opportunity are an important balancing factor in the game. Too many 
people weren't using them, unfortunately, mainly because they didn't 
understand how attacks of opportunity worked. That section of the rules 
was rewritten to make it easier to understand and implement for both 
players and DMs.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" color:#990000">Q: Eliminating partial actions will help clean up the system. Are any other changes being considered for the action categories?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A:
 Similar to attacks of opportunity, the "changes" are mostly 
clarifications. The new text is easier to understand. We're really proud
 of the fact that the revised combat chapter is both clearer and shorter
 than before without really taking anything away from the players. When 
you start working on combat rules, you're trying to reduce some pretty 
complex activity into just a few relatively simple options. With 3.0, we
 were happy with the combat rules and actions as they played -- the 
difficulty was explaining them in a way that let everyone grasp our 
intent and implement the rules the same way whether you're playing with 
Ph.D.s at NASA or with 12-year-olds in the middle school lunch hall. 
With the rewrite, we focused on laying out the basic system in clear, 
unambiguous language. We eliminated redundancies and stuck rigorously to
 the fundamentals. For example, you won't find any discussion of 
charging, grappling, turning undead, or other heroic or fantastic 
actions in the generalized discussion of combat. We want people to focus
 completely on understanding the basics before we start layering on all 
the "special actions" that make this fantasy combat. The special actions
 are still there but in their own section, so it's easier to see how 
they add onto the basic system without disrupting it. The end result is 
combat rules that are tighter, cleaner, and easier to grasp than any 
we've done before. After reading this chapter, determining whether 
something is a standard action, a move action, a full-round action, a 
free action, a restricted activity, or not an action at all should be 
simple and intuitive.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" color:#990000">Q: Which feats have been changed?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/underwater_combat.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="283" width="300">A:
 Most of them remain the same, with only some clarifications. A few are 
being changed to improve balance. The most noticeable difference will be
 that quite a few feats were renamed for reasons of internal logic. The 
feat Sunder, for example, is being renamed Improved Sunder, and sunder 
is now a combat action. We determined (based on feedback!) that there 
was no real reason a character without the Sunder feat couldn't break a 
weapon, and players wanted to try. Actually doing it is a lot easier if 
you have the feat, plus then you don't draw an attack of opportunity.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" color:#990000">Q: Are there any other tidbits about combat that you're willing to share?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A: The <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>
 is going to cover some conditions and environments that weren't dealt 
with in the original 3.0 books. Underwater combat, for example, gets a 
nifty little section of its own, complete with an illustration.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;">Blurring
 the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from 
divine sources and musty tomes alike. While most spellcasters choose one
 path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, 
simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;">Mystic theurges have unparalleled diversity of spells. In time, a mystic theurge can cast almost any spell in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 While a mystic theurge doesn't have the uninterrupted spell advancement
 that a cleric, wizard, or sorcerer has, he makes up for this with 
versatility. Mystic theurges are often obsessed with magical lore, 
traveling to the ends of the earth to learn some new arcane secret or 
divine insight.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;">Because
 a mystic theurge casts both arcane and divine spells, all members of 
this class are multiclass spellcasters. Cleric/sorcerers and 
cleric/wizards are the most common mystic theurges, with druid/sorcerers
 more rare and druid/wizards almost unheard of.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;">Mystic
 theurges tend to be fascinated with magic in whatever form it takes. 
They're always on the hunt for powerful magic items and new arcane 
spells. Those mystic theurges who worship a deity use the power of their
 spellcasting to further their deity's agenda.</span></p>

<p align="left"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Requirements</span></b></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To qualify to become a mystic theurge, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;"><b>Skills: </b>Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks.<br><b>Spells: </b>Able to cast 2nd-level divine spells and 2nd-level arcane spells.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; "><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Class Skills</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 mystic theurge's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are 
Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge 
(arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense 
Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for skill descriptions.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; "><b>Skill Points at Each Level:</b> 2 + Int modifier.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Class Features</span></b></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">All of the following are features of the mystic theurge prestige class.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: </b>Mystic theurges gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;"><b>Spells per Day:</b>
 When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new 
spells per day as if she had also gained a level in any one arcane 
spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class 
and any one divine spellcasting class she belonged to previously. She 
does not, however, gain any other benefit a character that class would 
have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin 
abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of
 mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class
 and divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells
 per day and caster level accordingly.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:12px;">For 
example, a 3rd-level cleric/3rd-level wizard who takes a level in mystic
 theurge has the same access to spells as a 4th-level cleric and a 
4th-level wizard. But she continues to turn undead as a 3rd-level 
cleric, and her wizard familiar won't gain any new abilities.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:12px; ">If a 
character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one 
divine spellcasting class before she became a mystic theurge, she must 
decide to which class she adds each level of mystic theurge for the 
purpose of determining spells per day.</span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>04/08/03 - <i>DMG</i> Prestige Class List</b></span></td>

<tr><td>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="570"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">For the <b>D&amp;D </b>3.5 <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>,
 the list of prestige classes has been expanded from six to sixteen. We 
previewed one of them last week -- the Mystic Theurge. This week, we 
offer a tiny peek at all sixteen.(Those marked with an * are the new 
ten.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Arcane Archer: </b>Master
 of the elven warbands, the arcane archer is a warrior skilled in using 
magic to supplement her combat prowess. Beyond the woods, arcane archers
 gain renown throughout entire kingdoms for their supernatural accuracy 
with a bow and their ability to imbue their arrows with magic.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Arcane Trickster: </b>Arcane
 tricksters combine their knowledge of spells with a taste for intrigue,
 larceny, or just plain mischief. They are among the most adaptable of 
adventurers.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Archmage: </b>The highest art is magic -- often referred to as <i>the</i>
 Art. Its most advanced practitioners are frequently archmages, 
characters who bend spells in ways unavailable to other spellcasters. An
 archmage gains strange powers and the ability to alter spells in 
remarkable ways, but must sacrifice some of her spell capability in 
order to master these arcane secrets.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Assassin: </b>The
 assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. Assassins also 
excel at infiltration and disguise. Assassins often function as spies, 
informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance. Their training in 
anatomy, stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry out 
missions of death with shocking, terrifying precision.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Blackguard: </b>The
 blackguard epitomizes evil. He is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The 
quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the 
foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and 
devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by 
all. Some people call these villains antipaladins due to their 
completely evil nature.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Dragon Disciple: </b>It
 is known that certain dragons can take humanoid form and even have 
humanoid lovers. Sometimes a child is born of this union, and every 
child of that child unto the thousandth generation claims a bit of 
dragon blood, be it ever so small. Usually, little comes of it, though 
mighty sorcerers occasionally credit their powers to draconic heritage. 
For some, however, dragon blood beckons irresistibly. These characters 
become dragon disciples, who use their magical power as a catalyst to 
ignite their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Duelist: </b>The
 duelist (sometimes known as the swashbuckler) is a nimble, intelligent 
fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as 
the rapier. He always takes full advantage of his quick reflexes and 
wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, a duelist feels the 
best way to protect himself is not to get hit at all.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Dwarven Defender: </b>The
 defender is a sponsored champion of a dwarven cause, a dwarf 
aristocrat, a dwarven deity, or the dwarven way of life. As the name 
might imply, this character is a skilled combatant trained in the arts 
of defense. A line of dwarven defenders is a far better defense than a 
10-foot-thick wall of stone, and much more dangerous.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Eldritch Knight: </b>Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast a <i>fireball</i>
 on his foes or charge them with sword drawn. The eldritch knight takes 
pride in his ability to use the right technique for the job: spells 
against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting 
enemies. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Hierophant: </b>A
 divine spellcaster who rises high in the service of his deity gains 
access to spells and abilities of which lesser faithful can only dream. 
The hierophant prestige class is open to powerful divine spellcasters 
who are approaching access to the strongest and most difficult divine 
spells. They delay the acquisition of these greatest gifts in exchange 
for a deeper understanding of and ability to control the power they 
channel.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/rs_Horizon_Walker.jpg" alt="Horizon Walker" title="Horizon Walker" border="0" align="right" height="358" width="204">*Horizon Walker: </b>The
 horizon walker is an unceasing traveler to the universe's most 
dangerous places. As her journeys take her from place to place, she 
adapts to become one with her environment. In time, she develops a 
mystic connection with the ground beneath her. But she is by no means 
tied to a particular place; her restless feet are ever leading her 
toward the horizon, where new adventures await.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Loremaster: </b>Loremasters
 are spellcasters who concentrate on knowledge, valuing lore and secrets
 over gold. They uncover secrets that they then use to better themselves
 mentally, physically, and spiritually.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Mystic Theurge: </b>Blurring
 the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from 
divine sources and musty tomes alike. While most spellcasters choose one
 path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, 
simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Red Wizard: </b>The
 Red Wizards are the masters of Thay, the would-be magical overlords of 
the land of Faerun (in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting). They 
focus on a school of magic more intently than any specialist, achieving 
incredible mastery of magic within a very narrow focus. Seen as cruel 
and evil tyrants by people across the worl of Toril, a few choose to 
leave their region, assume secret identities, and practice magic without
 having to worry about political alliances and possible slave uprisings.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Shadowdancer: </b>Operating
 in the border between light and darkness, shadowdancers are nimble 
artists of deception. They are mysterious and unknown, never completely 
trusted but always inducing wonder when met. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>*Thaumaturgist: </b>The
 thaumaturgist reaches out with divine power to other planes of 
existence, calling creatures there to do his bidding. Evil 
thaumaturgists conspire with demons and devils to gain power on the 
Material Plane, while good thaumaturgists send powerful angels or 
eladrins on holy quests. </span></p>

<tr><td>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="570"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">This
 week we offer a tantalizing whiff of the revised mummy and mummy lord. 
The mummy is an excellent example of a monster that was made tougher and
 then expanded with an interesting, more powerful variant. While the 
mummy is currently in a pretty advanced state of composition, bear in 
mind that <i>nothing is complete or final until you buy the book in the store.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" color:#CC0000;"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px;">Mummy</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">This
 creature looks like a withered and desiccated corpse, with features 
hidden beneath centuries-old funereal wrappings. It moves with a slow, 
shambling gait and groans with the weight of the ages.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mummies
 are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark desert gods
 best forgotten. They usually inhabit great tombs or temple complexes, 
maintaining a timeless vigil and destroying would-be grave robbers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">These
 horrid creatures are often marked with symbols of the dire gods they 
serve. While other undead often stink of carrion, the herbs and powders 
used to create a mummy give off a sharp, pungent odor like that of a 
spice cabinet.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mummies
 attack intruders without pause or mercy. They never attempt to 
communicate with their enemies and never retreat. An encounter with a 
mummy can end only with the destruction of one combatant or the other 
(unless the mummy's foe elects to retreat).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mummies can speak Common, but seldom bother to do so. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Combat</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">In
 melee combat, a mummy delivers a powerful blow. Even if it had no other
 abilities, its great strength and grim determination would make it a 
formidable opponent.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Despair (Su):</b>
 At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed on a DC 16 Will 
save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save 
is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same 
mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Mummy Rot (Su):</b>
 Supernatural disease -- slam, Fortitude DC 16, incubation period 1 
minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is Charisma-based.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or is cured as described below.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mummy
 rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting 
to cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature afflicted with 
mummy rot must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has 
no effect on the afflicted character.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>remove curse</i>
 (requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), after which a 
caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells on the 
victim, and the mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and dust that blow away into nothing at the first wind.</span></p>

 powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes rise as

armor, a rune-marked sword, or a magic staff. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mummy
 lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians of the
 tombs of high lords, priests, and mages. Most are sworn to defend for 
eternity the resting place of those whom they served in life, but in 
some cases a mummy lord's unliving state is the result of a terrible 
curse or rite designed to punish treason, infidelity, or crimes of an 
even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually 
imprisoned in a tomb that is never meant to be opened again.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">You've waited -- you've wondered -- you've waited some more. This week we finally get around to showing off the new <i>haste </i>spell that everyone's been harping about. The big question is, were we just procrastinating, or intentionally prolonging your <i>antici </i>... (wait for it) ... <i>pation</i>?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 spell had several problems as published -- mainly, it was just too 
good, especially for sorcerers. It overshadowed most other 3rd-level 
spells and made the Quicken Spell feat largely redundant. <i>Haste</i> 
was really meant to be a fighter buff, but wizards and sorcerers seemed 
to be the main beneficiaries. This new version brings it back to its 
intended function and should also eliminate the confusion that all those
 extra actions were causing.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As always, remember that <i>nothing is complete or final until you buy the book in the store.</i></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">When
 making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra 
attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the 
creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the
 situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as
 that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra
 action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an
 extra action in the round.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A <i>hasted</i>
 creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC 
and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus
 to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">All of the <i>hasted</i>
 creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, 
fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's 
normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an 
enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as 
normal for increased speed.</span></p>

<tr><td>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="570"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Attacks of opportunity are important to the overall balance of the <b>D&amp;D</b> combat rules. They're also a little bit confusing and easy to ignore. One of the many, many goals of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 3.5 is to deal with issues just like that. The new combat chapter is 
both shorter and easier to understand than the earlier version. As an 
example of the type of change we're talking about, here's the new 
description of attacks of opportunity. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As always, remember that <i>nothing is complete or final until you buy the book in the store.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;"><b>Attacks of Opportunity</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 melee combat rules assume that combatants are actively avoiding 
attacks. A player doesn't have to declare anything special for her 
character to be on the defensive. Even if a character's miniature figure
 is just standing there on the battle grid, you can be sure that if some
 orc with a battleaxe attacks the character, she is weaving, dodging, 
and even threatening the orc with a weapon to keep the orc a little 
worried for his own hide.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Sometimes,
 however, a combatant in a melee lets her guard down, and she doesn't 
maintain a defensive posture as usual. In this case, combatants near her
 can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. 
These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Threatened Squares:</b>
 You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even 
when it is not your action. Generally, that means everything in all 
squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that 
takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of
 opportunity from you. If you're unarmed, you don't normally threaten 
any squares and thus can't make attacks of opportunity (but see Unarmed 
Combat).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Reach Weapons:</i>
 Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. 
This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to
 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding 
reach weapons (such as a longspear) threaten more squares than a typical
 creature. For instance, a longspear-wielding human threatens all 
squares 10 feet (2 squares) away, even diagonally. (This is an exception
 to the rule that 2 squares of diagonal distance is measured as 15 
feet.) In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural 
reach of 10 feet or more; see Big and Little Creatures in Combat.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity:</b>
 Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a
 threatened square and performing an action within a threatened square. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Moving:</i>
 Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes an attack of 
opportunity from the threatening opponent. There are two common methods 
of avoiding such an attack -- the 5-foot-step (see Miscellaneous 
Actions) and the withdraw action (see Full-Round Actions).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Performing a Distracting Act:</i>
 Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of
 opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Casting a 
spell and attacking with a ranged weapon, for example, are distracting 
actions. Table 8-2: Actions in Combat notes many of the actions that 
provoke attacks of opportunity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Remember
 that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have
 exceptions to this rule. For instance, a character with the Improved 
Unarmed Strike feat doesn't incur an attack of opportunity for making an
 unarmed attack.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Making an Attack of Opportunity:</b>
 An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and you can only 
make one per round. You don't have to make an attack of opportunity if 
you don't want to. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">An
 experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by using 
the full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You make your 
attack of opportunity, however, at your normal attack bonus -- even if 
you've already attacked in the round. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">An
 attack of opportunity "interrupts" the normal flow of actions in the 
round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the 
attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character's turn (or 
complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in 
the midst of a character's turn).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity:</i>
 If you have the Combat Reflexes feat, you can add your Dexterity 
modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a 
round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given 
opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of 
opportunity from you -- such as by moving out of a threatened square and
 then casting a spell in a threatened square -- you could make two 
separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different 
opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same 
opponent in the same round doesn't count as more than one opportunity 
for that opponent. All these attacks are at your normal attack bonus. 
You do not reduce your attack bonus for making multiple attacks of 
opportunity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Finally,
 there'll be a diagram to go along with this explanation of attacks of 
opportunity, but it's not available yet. So instead, we'll share a pair 
of critters whose threatened spaces you'd rather not invade -- the balor
 and marilith.</span></p>

 investments yield greater riches than the time and gold spent to 
acquire a familiar. A lifelong companion, guard, spy, and servant, it is
 every spellcaster's best friend and most trusted confidante. The new <i>Player's Handbook </i>makes
 a few changes to familiars (most notably: bonuses are increased from +2
 to +3, and a few bonuses are altered a bit; a bat now confers a +3 
bonus on Listen checks and a hawk gives a +3 bonus on Spot checks in 
bright light; and "lizard" joins the list, with a +3 bonus on Climb 
checks). The really exciting change, however, comes in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> with the introduction of the Improved Familiar variant feat.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As always, remember that <i>nothing is complete or final until you buy the book in the store.</i></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">This
 feat allows spellcasters to acquire a new familiar from a nonstandard 
list, but only when they could normally acquire a new familiar (see <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment, sufficiently high level (see below).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Benefit:</b>
 When choosing a familiar, the creatures listed below are also available
 to the spellcaster. The spellcaster may choose a familiar with an 
alignment up to one step away on each of the alignment axes (lawful 
through chaotic, good through evil). For example, a chaotic good 
spellcaster could acquire a neutral familiar. A lawful neutral 
spellcaster could acquire any familiar that isn't chaotic. </span></p>

 with two exceptions: If the creature's type is something other than 
animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain the
 ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of 
them already have the ability to communicate). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The

familiars. Almost any creature of the same general size and power as 
those on the list makes a suitable familiar. Nor is the master's 
alignment the only possible categorization. For instance, improved 
familiars could be assigned by the master's creature type or subtype, as
 shown below.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">From the pages of the revised <i>Monster Manual</i>,
 a devil raises its ugly head this week, and we do mean ugly. The bone 
devil is one muy desagradable y feo customer. Even if your characters 
laugh at the prospect of fighting a bone devil or two, remember that in 
Baator, there's almost always someone bigger and badder around the next 
bend, and bone devils love to tattle.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As always, remember that <i>nothing is complete or final until you buy the book in the store.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Devil</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 scourge of humanity and the cosmos, devils are fiends from the Nine 
Hells of Baator, a lawful evil realm. Devils enjoy bullying those weaker
 than themselves and often attack good creatures just to gain a trophy 
or three. The most powerful devils occupy themselves with plots to seize
 power, wreck civilizations, and inflict misery upon mortals. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Many
 devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up 
powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like 
abilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as 
much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements;
 enemies can never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or 
real summoned devils joining the fray. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 most numerous devils are the baatezu, infamous for their strength, evil
 temperament, and ruthlessly efficient organization. Baatezu have a 
rigid caste system, in which authority derives not only from power but 
also from station. They occupy themselves mainly with extending their 
influence throughout the planes by corrupting mortals. Baatezu who 
further this goal are usually rewarded with improved stations.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Baatezu Traits:</b> A baatezu possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"> Immunity to fire and poison.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"> Resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"> See in Darkness (Su): All baatezu can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a <i>deeper darkness</i> spell.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Summon</i>
 (Sp): Baatezu share the ability to summon others of their kind (the 
success chance and type of baatezu summoned are noted in each monster 
description).</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"> Telepathy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Except when otherwise noted, devils speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.</span></p>

scorpion's, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Bone
 devils, also called osyluths, often serve as the police and informers 
of the Nine Hells, monitoring other devils' activities and reporting on 
their service. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Bone devils stand about 9 feet tall and weigh about 500 pounds.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Combat</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Bone devils hate all other creatures and attack ruthlessly. They freely use <i>wall of ice</i> to keep the enemy divided.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 bone devil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are 
treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
 damage reduction.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b>
 Bone devils can radiate a 5-foot radius fear aura as a free action. 
Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as 
though by a <i>fear</i> spell (caster level 7th). A creature that 
successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same bone devil's 
aura for 24 hours. Other baatezu are immune to the aura. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>dimensional anchor, fly, invisibility</i> (self only), <i>major image</i> (DC 15), <i>wall of ice</i>. Caster level 12th. The save DC is Charisma-based.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Summon Baatezu (Sp):</b>
 Once per day a bone devil can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures with a 50%
 chance of success, or another bone devil with a 35% chance of success. 
This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</span></p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Gnome Racial Traits</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">+2
 Constitution, -2 Strength: Like dwarves, gnomes are tough, but they are
 small and therefore not as strong as larger humanoids.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Small:
 As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1
 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he 
uses smaller weapons than humans use and his lifting and carrying limits
 are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Low-light
 vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, 
moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He 
retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these 
conditions.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather then exotic weapons.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">+2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions: Gnomes are innately familiar with illusions of all kinds.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Add
 +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion 
spells cast by gnomes. Their innate familiarity with these effects make 
their illusions more difficult to see through. This adjustment stacks 
with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">+1
 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids (including 
goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears): Gnomes battle these creatures 
frequently and practice special techniques for fighting them.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">+4
 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type (such as 
ogres, trolls, and hill giants): This bonus represents special training 
that gnomes undergo, during which they learn tricks that previous 
generations developed in their battles with giants. Any time a creature 
loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it's 
caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too. The Monster Manual 
has information on which creatures are of the giant type.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">+2 racial bonus on Listen checks: Gnomes have keen ears.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">+2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks: A gnome's sensitive nose allows him to monitor alchemical processes by smell.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Automatic
 Languages: Common and Gnome. Bonus Languages: Draconic Dwarven, Elven, 
Giant, Goblin, and Orc. Gnomes deal more with elves and dwarves than 
elves and dwarves deal with one another, and they learn the languages of
 their enemies (kobolds, giants, goblins, and orcs) as well. In 
addition, a gnome can speak with a burrowing mammal (a badger, fox, 
rabbit, or the like, see below). This ability is innate to gnomes. See 
the speak with animals spell description.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day -- <i>speak with animals</i>
 (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma 
score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day 
-- <i>dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation.</i> Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome's Cha modifier + spell level. See the spell descriptions.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Favored
 Class: Bard. A multiclass gnome's bard class does not count when 
determining whether he takes an experience point penalty (see XP for 
Multiclass Characters)</span></li>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">What
 can you say about druids? Well, they make terrific villains. And hey, 
they're pretty darn cool as PCs, too. It's never wise to disrespect 
someone who can turn into a coral snake and crawl into your bedroll as a
 "practical joke." </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As always, remember that <i>nothing is complete or final until you buy the book in the store.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Druids have the following game statistics.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Abilities:</b>
 Wisdom determines how powerful a spell a druid can cast, how many 
spells she can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. To
 cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell's 
level. A druid gets bonus spells based on Wisdom. The Difficulty Class 
of a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell's level + 
the druid's Wisdom modifier. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Since a druid wears only light or medium armor, a high Dexterity score greatly improves her defensive ability.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Alignment:</b> Neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Hit Die:</b> d8.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:19px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Class Skills</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 druid's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are 
Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), 
Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), 
Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim 
(Str). See Chapter 4: Skills for skill descriptions.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Skill Points at 1st Level</b>: (4 + Int modifier) x 4.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Skill Points at Each Additional Level:</b> 4 + Int modifier.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:19px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Class Features</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">All of the following are class features of the druid.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b>
 Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, 
quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are 
also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of 
any form they assume with wild shape (see below). Druids are proficient 
with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor;
 thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may 
also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the <i>ironwood</i> spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the <i>ironwood</i> spell description.) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is 
unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like
 class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Spells:</b>
 A druid casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to the 
cleric, paladin, and ranger), which are drawn from the druid spell list.
 Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to 
her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful 
Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance 
(see below).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">To
 prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at
 least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 
1st-level spells, and so forth). The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
 against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom 
modifier.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Like
 other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of
 each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on 
Table 3-8: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if 
she has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-1: Ability Modifiers and Bonus 
Spells). She does not have access to any domain spells or granted 
powers, as a cleric does.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/Nymph_72a.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="334" width="194"></span></b>A
 druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she 
cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see 
Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on 
the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, 
but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Spontaneous Casting</b>:
 A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she 
hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order 
to cast any <i>summon nature's ally</i> spell of the same level or lower. For example, a druid who has prepared <i>repel vermin</i> (a 4th-level spell) may lose <i>repel vermin</i> in order to cast <i>summon nature's ally IV</i> (also a 4th-level spell). </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:</b>
 A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her 
deity's (if she has one). For example, a neutral good druid cannot cast 
evil spells. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated 
by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell 
descriptions (see Chapter 11: Spells).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Bonus Languages:</span></b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">
 A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of 
woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages 
available to the character because of her race (see Race and Languages 
and the <i>Speak Language</i> skill).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which
 she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language 
for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment 
of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are 
forbidden to teach this language to nondruids. Druidic has its own 
alphabet.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Animal Companion (Ex):</b>
 A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the 
following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, 
horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or 
wolf. If the DM's campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic 
environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the druid's list 
of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is
 a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as 
appropriate for its kind.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except 
as noted in the sidebar on page 36. As a druid advances in level, the 
animal's power increases as shown on the table in the sidebar.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">If
 a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by 
performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This 
ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of 
animals (see the sidebar). Should she select an animal companion from 
one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the 
character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the 
value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's 
druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the 
table in the sidebar to determine the animal companion's powers. (If 
this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, 
she can't have that animal as a companion.) For example, a 6th-level 
druid could select a leopard as an animal companion. The leopard would 
have characteristics and special abilities as if the druid were 3rd 
level (taking into account the -3 adjustment) instead of 6th level.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b>
 A druid can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve 
the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This 
ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the 
attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and 
adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild 
empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting 
attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/Dryad_72a.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="400" width="150"></b>To
 use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each 
other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under
 normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1
 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less 
time.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an 
Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but she
 takes a -4 penalty on the check.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b>
 Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth
 (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) 
at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other 
impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been 
magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Trackless Step (Ex):</b>
 Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings 
and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</b>
 Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws 
against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, pixies, and 
sprites).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Palatino;"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Wild Shape (Su):</span></b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">
 At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small 
or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms 
include all creatures with the animal type (see the <i>Monster Manual</i>). This ability functions like the <i>polymorph</i>
 spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid 
level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a
 standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</span></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. For 
example, a druid who has never been outside a temperate forest could not
 become a polar bear. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is 
limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she 
can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping
 as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so 
changing to this form does not permit speech.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, 
and 18th level, as noted on Table 3-8: The Druid. In addition, she gains
 the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny 
animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level. The new form's 
Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level. For instance, a druid
 can't take the form of a dire bear (a Large creature that always has at
 least 12 HD) until 12th level, even though she can begin taking Large 
forms at 8th level.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">At
 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a 
plant creature, such as a shambling mound, with the same size 
restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to 
take the form of a plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or a rose
 bush.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">At
 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a 
Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per 
day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape 
usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains 
all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like 
abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she 
maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type 
(humanoid, in most cases).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="Compiled%20D&amp;D%20Revision%20Spotlight_files/Satyr_72a.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="240" width="222"></b>At
 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per 
day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level,
 a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge 
elemental.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Venom Immunity (Ex):</b> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>A Thousand Faces (Su):</b> At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the <i>alter self</i> spell, but only while in her normal form.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Timeless Body (Ex):</b>
 After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score 
penalties for aging (see Table 6-5: Aging Effects) and cannot be 
magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, 
remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old 
age when her time is up.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial; font-size:19px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Ex-Druids</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, 
or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid
 abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, 
armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a
 druid until she atones (see the <i>atonement</i> spell description).</span></p>

feat, but Snatch Arrows is almost too cool for the internet. Imagine the

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Benefit:</b>
 You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this 
feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged 
weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must 
be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a 
ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged 
weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants, and ranged attacks generated
 by spell effects, such as <i>Melf's acid arrow</i>, can't be deflected. </span></p>

 When using the Deflect Arrows feat, you may catch the weapon instead of

 small scales of a wyrmling red dragon are a bright glossy scarlet, 
making the dragon easily spotted by predators and hunters, so it stays 
underground and does not venture outside until it is more able to take 
care of itself. Toward the end of young age, the scales turn a deeper 
red, and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. As the
 dragon grows older, the scales become large, thick, and as strong as 
metal. The neck frill and wings are an ash blue or purple-gray toward 
the edges, becoming darker with age. The pupils of a red dragon fade as 
it ages; the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava 
orbs.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Red
 dragons lair in large caves that extend deep into the earth, which 
shimmer with the heat of their bodies and are marked by a sulfurous, 
smoky odor. However, they always have a high perch nearby from which to 
haughtily survey their territory, which they consider to be everything 
in sight. This high perch sometimes intrudes upon the territory of a 
silver dragon, and for this reason red dragons and silver dragons are 
often enemies.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Red
 dragons are meat eaters by preference, and their favorite food is a 
human or elven youth. Sometimes they charm villagers into regularly 
sacrificing townsfolk to them.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Because
 red dragons are so confident, they seldom pause to appraise an 
adversary. On spotting a target, they make a snap decision whether to 
attack, using one of many strategies worked out ahead of time. A red 
dragon lands to attack small, weak creatures with its claws and bite 
rather than obliterating them with its breath weapon, so as not to 
destroy any treasure they might be carrying.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">We can think of lots of good reasons why someone might not have seen the new <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>
 in the store yet -- or better yet, brought one home. Maybe a landslide 
sealed you off inside a lost canyon. Maybe your legs are pinned beneath a
 ferris wheel. Maybe you live in an abandoned molybdenum mine and the 
elevator to the surface is on the fritz. (Let's face it, nobody wants to
 shinny up a mile of cable.) Maybe your household pets have locked you 
in the closet while they methodically transfer all your assets to 
untraceable, offshore accounts. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">We don't mean to minimize your problems, but you owe it to yourself to get out and see the new <b>D&amp;D</b> 3.5 handbooks in person. For those of you who really, really can't, we offer this glimpse at the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> table of contents. Once you see what's in store at the end, that long climb up the cable won't be so daunting.</span></p>
