 character has a unique view of the world, of right and wrong, of 
fairness and natural rights. This alignment test, taken from the 
Alignment chapter of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp%27tsr11647">Hero Builder's Guidebook</a></i>, helps you figure out how your character will relate to various moral and ethical choices in the game.</p>
<p class="size2">Take this short quiz "in character," answering the 
questions as your PC would. The results of the test will suggest an 
alignment for your character. Click on only one answer for each 
question.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>What Alignment Means</b></p>
<p class="size2">Alignment is central to a <b>D&amp;D</b> character's personality. <b>D&amp;D</b> uses two measures to determine a specific character's ethical and moral attitudes and behavior.</p>
<p class="size2">The moral axis has three positions: good, neutral and 
evil. Good characters generally care about the welfare of others. 
Neutral people generally care about their own welfare. Evil people 
generally seek to harm the others' welfare.</p>
<p class="size2">The ethical axis has three positions as well: lawful, 
neutral, and chaotic. Lawful people generally follow the social rules as
 they understand them. Neutral people follow those rules find convenient
 or obviously necessary. And chaotic people seek to upset the social 
order and either institute change, or simply create anarchy.</p>

<p class="size2">Before you begin, keep in mind these caveats.</p>
<p class="size2"> You'll undoubtedly want more information about the 
question, and more options than the answers presented to you. Just do 
the best you can, and skip a question completely if you're totally 
stuck.</p>
<p class="size2"> Note that some questions are interested in 
correlations to behavior, not the behavior itself. For example, lawful 
people tend to work at secure jobs -- this doesn't mean that working a 
steady job makes you lawful.</p>
<p class="size2"> Remember that certain character classes have codes of 
conduct that fall beyond the dictates of alignment. Paladins, for 
example, aren't just supposed to be lawful and good. They are expected 
to act humble, pious, and chivalric as well.</p>
<p class="size2"> This quiz assumes a typical <b>D&amp;D</b> setting, 
which is a mix of fantasy elements, medieval ideas, and epic myth seen 
through modern eyes. If your setting is vastly different (or your fellow
 players are), you may get very different answers to this quiz.</p>
