 adventure, discuss all the expansions to the psionic system -- new 
powers, feats, prestige classes... and new psionic race, the synad!</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the interests of better involving the player community with the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, questions for this interview were solicited in part via the <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=8601677">message boards</a>. Our thanks to everyone who took the time to submit a question or two... or four.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b>To start with... you. What 
inspired your interest in psionics? Is this a system you've always been 
involved with as a player/DM, or how did you come into it?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce R. Cordell: </b>I checked every character I 
rolled for the small chance he might have psionics, according to the 
rules at the back of the 1st edition <i>Player's Handbook</i>. Every so 
often, I got lucky; my first psionic character could use mind blast and 
go ethereal; that is, until my DM, concerned with the havoc I was 
wreaking with his game, engineered an encounter between myself and 
Kulgar the Mind-Ripper. Good-bye going ethereal at will.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Much later, I had the good fortune to write the <i>Ilithiad</i>
 for 2nd edition, as well as three supporting adventures. Because I had 
to delve so deeply into psionics, including suggesting the use of 
alternate rules (again, for game balance!), I came away with an even 
stronger appreciation for the possibilities psionics could offer a <b>D&amp;D</b> game.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Chris Lindsay: </b>I'd say that originally it stems 
from my love of comic books and superheroes, particularly those of a 
more cerebral bent, such as Charles Xavier, Jean Grey, and Rachel 
Summers (both Phoenix at one point or another).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>As for the book, let's start with the broad strokes--why <i>Complete Psionic</i>?
 What does the book have in store for diehard proponents of psionics, as
 well as folks who hadn't considered psionics before but might now give 
it another look?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL:</b> The book does an excellent job of expanding 
the options for psionic characters, allowing them to fill nearly any 
role within a party of heroes in their own unique way. Additionally, for
 those playing the classic psionic classes (psion, wilder, soulknife), 
it more fully develops specific aspects and paths these characters might
 choose to tread.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC: </b><i>Complete Psionic</i> is one answer to the fact that, by and large, psionic rules are not supported in the same way that rules for spellcasting are; <i>Complete Psionic</i> provides a whole new raft of psionic powers, feats, and other opportunities for players who have psionic characters. <i>Complete Psionic</i> offers characters already using the rules of the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> (<i>XPH</i>) with additional feats for their characters, whether they are playing an elan or githyanki, psion or soulknife.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond the deep support for those already invested in a 
character, we do offer a few new classes, a new race (see below) and 
other new opportunities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-03%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/dx0403ps_spotlight_synad.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="481" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b>Ah yes, the new race. <i>Complete Psionic </i>introduces the synad--can you tell us a bit about it?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> The synad are a race of psionic humanonids 
who have spent so much time perfecting their brains that each individual
 is actually much like three personalities in one body--which gives the 
race certain advantages. Having a 'triune' mind allows synads, to a 
limited extent, to split their attention between tasks better than the 
average psionic or non-psionic race.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>Does the book also supply racial 
classes? I'm imagining the thri-kreen and half-giants would be welcome 
choices from psionic traditions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> The following racial classes can be found in <i>Complete Psionic</i>:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Duergar, Half-Giant, Githyanki, Githzerai, and Thri-Kreen.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b><i>Complete Psionic </i>also brings 3 
new classes (not to mention 8 more prestige classes) to the game. Can 
you tell us a bit about the ardent, divine mind, and lurk? What roles 
are these classes expected to fill in a party?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> In a nutshell: An ardent and divine mind are
 two sides of a coin; they both use psionic power as a tool to 
manipulate divine energy. The lurk uses psionic power to become a 
perfect killer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>There's also the variant erudite: what 
changes were made to transform the erudite from a separate base class 
into a variant psionic class?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> The erudite's schtick is that he knows an 
unlimited number of psionic powers, as opposed to the circumscribed list
 available to the psion. What he gives up is the number of unique powers
 he can manifest in a day. This class is closely modeled on the erudite 
published in <i>Dragon</i> Magazine some time back, though this class variant (with a few tweaks) is the official version.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>About the new prestige classes--are 
these entirely original, or psionic versions of existing PrCs, or 
perhaps a combination? Would any of these PrCs be considered pure good 
or evil in nature?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-03%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/dx0403ps_spotlight_flayerspawn.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="390" width="243"><b>BRC:</b>
 Some are entirely original, like the flayerspawn psychic; some build on
 concepts already in the game, but expand on them, like the soulbow; and
 at least one is an update of a <i>Dragon</i> Magazine psionic prestige 
class, the zerth cenobite. A class called the illumine soul might be 
pure good; otherwise, most of the other classes can be played as 
desired, though the flayerspawn psychic is tempted to evil.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL: </b>Generally speaking, the prestige classes are 
original, taking a specific aspect of a psionic base class and expanding
 further upon it in order to create a fully specialized character. The 
anarchic initiate expands upon their power through their connection to 
chaos; the illumine soul forges a connection to the Positive Energy 
Plane, allowing them to infuse this energy into their mindblade; the 
ectopic adept becomes a master of astral constructs, creating versions 
of these that are superior to those presented in the original <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>.
 While none of the prestige classes is tied to a specific alignment, it 
isn't difficult to see how some might drift toward one alignment or 
another. The flayerspawn psychic might drift toward evil even as it 
grows closer and closer to its illithid heritage. At the same time, the 
illumine soul might tend to drift the other direction as their 
connection to positive energy grew stronger.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b><i>Complete Psionic</i> offers a wealth 
of new feats, everything from Aggressive Mind to Xeph Celerity. Folks 
are curious about what options these feats might provide their 
characters--i.e., do they provide mobility, expand on what you can do 
while keeping psionic focus, have anti-magic effect (as the <i>XPH</i> has anti-psionic feats)?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC: </b>All of the above. ;)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL: </b>Name it! They're all about giving the psionic
 character more options, expanding existing powers and abilities (both 
racial and class).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>There's also a call for further soulknife support. Are any of the feats (or other goodies) geared specifically for them?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> A whole bunch of support exists for the 
soulknife; I believe some soulknife-specific feats will be/are in the 
online preview, as an example.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL: </b>Definitely, the illumine soul prestige class 
takes the soulknife to new places by allowing the character to forge a 
link with the Positive Energy Plane and manipulate those energies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b><i>Complete Psionic </i>also includes host feats (related to <b>Eberron</b>'s kalashtar and inspired); are these feats exclusive to <b>Eberron</b>, or can they be implemented in a general campaign?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> I broadened the requirements of <b>Eberron</b>-only
 kalashtar pre-req feats to require any one of a series of "Host" feats 
that any psionic character can take. These feats call a "formless 
psionic entity" that takes up residence in your body. In return it 
"gives you access to psi-like abilities".</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>Beyond feats, psionics players are curious about the book's new powers. Can we get a taste of what these might be?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL: </b>Getting a taste would be more like trying to 
drink from a fire hose... There are so many new powers available to 
psionic characters through this book that it is difficult to know where 
to begin. My favorites are the "Stygian" powers, which allow the psionic
 character to manipulate energy from the Negative Energy Plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>Will there be any epic support?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> Yes, the new classes have epic support in the book.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>Of course, it can't all be about the 
players, right? What psionic creatures (or constructions) might the book
 have in store to pit against them--any favorites from that chapter?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> Actually, many of the creatures <i>are </i>about
 the player, including the many "pre-packaged astral constructs" 
accessible through the so-called Ectopic Form feats, and the elemental 
envoys, which can provide psionic PCs with various forms of service.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2004-03%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/dx0403ps_spotlight_swarm.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="353" width="240">CL: </b>Absolutely yes, the ectoplasmic swarm is an absolute terror (I love it) in the hands of players and DMs alike.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>Following which, there's the question of
 treasure--will there be new psychoactive skins and other specialty 
items to add to a psionic character's hoard?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL:</b> Yup, new skins... new crowns... new masks... 
and the inclusion of all new psionic goodies, such as the stackable 
psionatrix items that take up a single body slot with multiple 
psionatrix, thus increasing the power and flexibility of your character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> Various new treasures are described, including Psionic Locations.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b>Finally, is there anything in particular from <i>Complete Psionic </i>that was your favorite to bring into the system? Any hard decisions on what to leave out?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC:</b> I'm happy with the flayerspawn psychic (and 
associated Illithid Heritage feats), the Host feats, the various feats 
that complement the classes that already exist (like the soulknife), the
 Ectopic Form feats and various creatures associated with them. Also, 
having just had a chance to see a pre-print today, I see that I really 
love many pieces of art, especially of the monsters, and various other 
things scattered throughout the book.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CL: </b>To be totally honest, I think the whole book is pretty freakin' cool, not that I'm biased.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>BRC: </b>Thanks for giving the chance to answer your questions! I hope you love the book!</p>
