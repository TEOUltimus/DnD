<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2012-05%20-%20Complete%20Warrior%20Team%20Interview_files/cw_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="178" width="140">In this month's exclusive interview, the designers of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/176640000">Complete Warrior</a></i> discuss the book that proves some things are worth fighting for.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Let's start with a very significant statement from the introduction to <i>Complete Warrior</i>: "This is not 'the fighter book.'" With the book also covering martial options for the nonfighter types in </b>D&amp;D<b>, which character classes get the lion's share of new, upgraded martial bonuses? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David Noonan:</b> In short, anybody who makes attack rolls. That's often the fighter, of course, but there's something in <i>Complete Warrior</i>
 for the polymorphed wizard, the wild-shaped druid, and any number of 
archetypes who don't trundle around in heavy armor heaving a big 
battleaxe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed Stark:</b> Any players who want their characters 
to get better at fighting, or at combat in general, will find things in 
this book. Certainly, those who wield weapons--from fighters and rangers
 to rogues and clerics--will find more options they can explore through 
feats, tactics, and prestige classes, but we went out of our way to make
 sure there were fighting options for non-sword-swingers. There's one 
prestige class designed specifically for bards who want to be better at 
fighting, and there are even options for barbarian/sorcerer hybrids.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you play a fighter-type of any class, you want this 
book. If you are more of a pure spellcaster or a nonfighting bard or 
something like that, you should still look at the options, but there 
will be other books more "for you." Honestly, though, a large part of <b>D&amp;D</b> as a game is fighting monsters. I can't imagine a character who wouldn't find something interesting in this book.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: You introduce three new classes in <i>Complete Warrior</i>:
 the samurai, the hexknight, and the swashbuckler. Each clearly has its 
pros and cons. What's the selling point of each of these new classes? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy Collins:</b> The hexknight is the arcane answer 
to the paladin or ranger--a warrior-type base class with limited arcane 
spellcasting ability and a few special abilities. The class's key 
ability is the hex--the ability to imbue opponents with penalties to 
their attacks, saves, and so forth. The swashbuckler is the base class 
for all those fighters out there who never want to put on plate armor. 
It's all about agility and style.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> The samurai is a bit of a different take than the one presented in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882440000">Oriental Adventures</a></i>. This one has a squinty-eyed gunslinger feel about him--and a related prestige class: the ronin.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed:</b> In fact, the samurai is the honorable 
warrior. Players who might not want to be paladins (perhaps because they
 aren't interested in spellcasting) will like this class. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The prestige classes run deep in the new 
book, with a wide range of options. (I find the reaping mauler to be a 
very cool class, for instance.) Do you have favorites from among them? 
Will players gravitate toward any in particular? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> I like the master of the unseen hand, a 
spellcaster (or creature like a githyanki) who uses telekinesis to fight
 rock-'em, sock-'em style. The tattooed monk has cool flavor and it's 
interesting mechanically. And the new spellsword can really hold his own
 in a fight now.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed:</b> It's always hard to guess which prestige 
classes will work in your game and which won't. My preferences have 
always been very campaign-specific. I like the prestige classes that 
take "suboptimal" but interesting choices and make them powerful and 
exciting. The dervish, for example, is a character who uses no armor and
 only slashing weapons. Her shtick is all about movement and multiple 
attacks. Normally a character would be very vulnerable using those 
choices, but she's pretty interesting.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Some of the prestige classes, like the 
cavalier, have been around for a while. As you went through old 
material, were there interesting options for prestige classes (or other 
parts of the book, for that matter) that just couldn't be updated 
adequately for inclusion? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed:</b> Nope. We rose to the challenge, though it was
 sometimes difficult. Okay, maybe I'm kidding a little bit there, 
because everyone will make different choices. Seriously, though, when we
 chose to pick up an idea or upgrade an existing prestige class, we did 
it because people asked for it and we saw a challenge to be overcome. 
The cavalier is a good example--the 3.0 cavalier tried to reflect the 
nature of the old cavalier class but didn't go far enough, and had a few
 "broken" elements. We hope the 3.5 version really hits the mark.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> Updating things adequately wasn't a 
problem, but inevitably with a book like this, you have to ask yourself,
 "Is this the right book for this prestige class/feat/magic 
item/whatever?" There are only so many pages in the book, after all. 
With prestige classes in particular, it's almost like we're the casting 
directors and there's a long line of example characters, studying their 
scripts, waiting for their turn on stage. We fill all the roles we have 
room for, and the rest have to wait for an audition for the next book.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: You also offer up an exceptional range of 
new feats--general, divine, weapon style mastery, and so forth. You also
 have some engaging new spells, with emphasis on the hexblade spells for
 the hexknight class. What do you find most intriguing of all this new 
material? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed:</b> Well, the hexknight is so cool it had to be 
its own class! Beyond that, though, I really like the divine feats. I 
know they aren't original (for the most part) to this book. <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882340000">Defenders of the Faith</a>
 introduced most of them and there are plenty more to come in future 
products. However, knowing that players of paladins and clerics will 
want this book, I thought it imperative that we took some of the more 
martial divine feats and put them in here. I like giving paladins, in 
particular, things to do with their turning checks that keep the option 
interesting. Realistically, a paladin is seldom in a situation where 
turning undead is a viable option. Now she has reason to keep track of 
those turning attempts per day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: It's a bold stand to try to define "War in the </b>D&amp;D<b>
 Game" in chapter 4, because war in the game has been the crux of many a
 campaign for many years. How did you even begin to encapsulate such 
vast and sweeping subject matter? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> By cheating--or at least by trying to have it both ways. Some <b>D&amp;D</b>
 players imagine war as knights in shining armor, vast arrays of 
rank-and-file troops, and colorful standards fluttering in the breeze. 
Other<b> D&amp;D</b> players imagine stealthy units employing magical 
camouflage, commandos teleporting from place to place, and dragons 
providing air support. We tried to cover both the traditional and more 
modern approaches to war without shoehorning DMs into one paradigm or 
the other.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed: </b>It was definitely something that had to be talked about. We felt that since wars are a big part of <b>D&amp;D </b>campaign
 history, and this book is about martial character choices, we needed to
 discuss some options for the players and the DM in a war setting. 
You'll notice, however, that we didn't try to set up complex rules for 
resolving a war--that would take a whole, special book on its own, and 
this book is about characters.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: What will players find most beneficial in these new rules? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> I think it's the basic variety offered by 
the book that will be most interesting and beneficial to players. There 
are a lot of new options here, from base classes to feats to prestige 
classes to exotic weapons and beyond, and knowing that there's always 
something new for your character to strive for is one of the most 
compelling elements of <b>D&amp;D.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> There's obviously a lot you can use in 
your game right away--feats and equipment come to mind--and a lot that 
you can point your character toward as your game progresses, such as 
prestige classes. In the end, every character who likes to fight will 
probably pick up a few feats, an item or two, and maybe a prestige class
 from this book. And DMs will naturally use all those tools for their 
NPCs, too.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: How did you playtest these new rules? Did 
you generate the classes and then do battle with them, or did you run 
them through standard sessions? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> Some of both. Often we'll create a few 
characters that use the rules bits we're trying to test (feats, a 
prestige class, etc.) and run them alongside our 
straight-from-the-factory Mialee, Jozan, Tordek, and Lidda in a number 
of encounters--generally one or two sessions' worth, although we just 
run the mechanically intensive parts like fights, traps, and other 
hazards. That way we have two ways to assess them: How did the new 
characters handle the monsters? And how did the new characters perform 
compared to their more traditional counterparts?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed: </b>Right--usually, it's a mix of both. Sometimes
 a prestige class is actually a multiclass combination that someone has 
tried out and recommends. Sometimes it's just a collection of feats and 
ideas that point in the same direction. Writing up the prestige class, 
mechanically anyway, then becomes a lot easier. Our development staff, 
however, has their work cut out for them on any book that features a lot
 of prestige classes, and they do a lot of discussion and playtesting 
whenever they can. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: What was left on the cutting room floor because of space, focus, logic, etc.? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> A smattering of things from most of the 
categories you'd expect: feats, prestige classes, magic items, and so 
on. They probably aren't gone for good--we found good homes in future 
products for most of them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ed:</b> I created a walk-through of creating prestige
 classes (and a prestige class from my home campaign to go along with 
it), but it turned out to be just a slight reiteration of the article in
 <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20031205a">Dragon</a> magazine on prestige classes. Since we didn't have anything new to say, and the book was tight, we cut it. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Finally, what are you working on now? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b>I'm working on a project for late 2004. 
Unfortunately, our schedule is planned out so far into the future that 
current projects are well beyond the extent of any available catalogs 
and thus can't be discussed. My next published work will be <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>, a treasure trove of variant rules and new subsystems for players and DMs to add to their campaigns.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>David:</b> Like Andy, I can't announce one of the projects I'm working on. The other one's fair game, though: I'm helping develop the <i>Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</i>. </p>
