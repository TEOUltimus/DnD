<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Given the focus of the other books in this series -- <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/176640000">Complete Warrior</a>,</i></b><i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/880360000">Complete Divine</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179250000">Complete Arcane</a></b></i><b>-- it would seem that designing<i> Complete Adventurer</i>
 would prove a particularly challenging undertaking, especially to avoid
 repeating material from those other books. What basic structure did you
 apply when outlining this book? How did you decide where to begin?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> I really like to start writing on 
Day One of a project, so I always do outlining before my official design
 time begins. I started writing an outline for <i>Complete Adventurer </i>about three weeks before I actually began writing. With <i>Complete Adventurer,</i> I built the outline based on the structures of earlier <i>Complete</i>
 books and the assignment from the design manager that was something 
like: Create three base classes, a fair number of prestige classes, and 
"do a lot with skills." </p>
<p align="LEFT">Once I actually start writing, though, I'm far less 
organized. I never write a book straight through; I start with a very 
rough outline for it, and then just work on a different section each 
day, as inspiration occurs. I spent the first couple of weeks working on
 the base classes, mainly because I was excited about some of the ideas 
and wanted to make sure that there was extra time for playtesting. Since
 <i>Complete Arcane</i> and <i>Complete Adventurer</i> were being 
designed at the same time and both dealt with different aspects of 
bards, there was some confusion about what parts of a bard's abilities 
belonged in each book. That, however, was a minor concern, and was 
easily dealt with in a quick conversation with Rich Baker, the designer 
of <i>Complete Arcane</i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i> Complete Adventurer</i> really expands 
the rules and possibilities for skills and feats. In the introduction 
you describe this as "new applications for existing skills." Tell us 
about these new applications and what players are going to find exciting
 about them.</b></p><p align="LEFT"></p><b>Jesse:</b> There are new uses
 for eighteen different skills (and that's counting Craft as only one 
skill). They range from simple twists like taking a penalty to picking a
 lock faster than normal, to tailing someone through a city unseen. New 
uses for existing skills should always excite players -- more ways to 
use skills means more options throughout every stage of an adventure. I 
like characters who have lots of options both in and out of combat, and I
 like it when the rules help the DM figure out how things work. New uses
 for skills do a great job of serving both of those desires, so they're a
 really good addition to the game in my opinion. <p></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The book also introduces quite a few new 
feats. Some have descriptive names -- Danger Sense, Dive for Cover, Leap
 Attack -- while other names seem a bit more poetic -- Brachiation, 
Green Ear, Open Minded. What are some of your favorite new ones? Which 
do you imagine will see quite a bit of use?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse:</b> Well, Brachiation and Green Ear are revised versions of the 3.0 feats of the same name; keeping with the <i>Complete</i>
 books' mission of updating some of the best (and worst) 3.0 material to
 bring it more in line with the 3.5 revision. Mobile Spellcasting, one 
of my favorite feats from the book, lets a wizard with the right skills 
double move and cast a spell in the same combat round. There are also a 
large number of new feats that help multiclass characters in interesting
 ways. The book introduces a new style of feat that encourages paladins 
and monks to multiclass by allowing different class levels to stack when
 using abilities such as Smite Evil, Sneak Attack, or Favored Enemy and 
removing the multiclass restrictions. There are new bardic music feats 
and new wild feats too -- I really enjoy designing feats that allow an 
existing ability to be used in new and interesting ways. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Of the three new character classes, the 
spellthief seems destined for popularity (at least among NPCs, if for no
 other reason than that it will drive wizards nuts to encounter one). 
What's the inspiration for the design of this class?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse:</b> Designing the new classes for <i>Complete Adventurer</i>
 was a tricky assignment -- all three had to be able to fulfill the 
rogue's niche in the party. It's important that a player who chooses one
 of the new classes doesn't get criticized by the group for not having 
access to certain skills and abilities (such as Open Locks and 
Trapfinding). Beyond those parameters, I'm also very picky about core 
classes. If a core class doesn't bring something new to the game, I 
don't think it's worth publishing. I had three ideas that fit within 
these guidelines: a non-spellcaster who wants to move every round of 
combat (as opposed to standing in one place and slugging it out with 
full attacks); a high-offense, low-defense character with limited 
ability to remove himself from the field of battle; and a character that
 uses a foe's resources to power his own abilities. These ideas became 
the scout, the ninja, and the spellthief respectively.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So that's really it -- I had a thought that a character 
who used a foe's resources to power his own abilities would be fun to 
play. Once I got that far, I started working on the mechanics first. 
That's actually unusual for me, as I normally design rules to follow the
 flavor of a game element, rather than the other way around. With the 
spellthief, though, I found the rules that I liked, and then wrote a 
background for the class around what I had designed. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: More than 25 new prestige classes appear in<i> Complete Adventurer</i>. That's a lot of new material! What new ground do so many prestige classes cover?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse:</b> The new prestige classes reward versatile 
character builds, and several focus on multiclass spellcasters. Classes 
like the daggerspell adept make otherwise underpowered choices (like 
druid/rogue) into cool and interesting choices. My favorite is probably 
the shadowbane inquisitor, a prestige class that's easiest to qualify 
for by taking levels in paladin and rogue. Members of the shadowbane 
inquisitors are gifted with a conviction so strong that they sometimes 
stray into intolerance or evil. I like it a lot because the prestige 
class also sort of auto-qualifies the character for the blackguard 
prestige class, presenting a flavorful and interesting way for a paladin
 (whether PC or NPC) to fall to evil. </p>
<p align="LEFT">It's no secret that one of the purposes behind the 
"Complete" series is to update the best (and also the most problematic) 
prestige classes from the 3.0 "splat books" such as <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/886680000">Song &amp; Silence</a></i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: You state that the spells in this book 
"interact with skills." What does that mean to the average player? How, 
exactly, can my skills enhance or modify my spells? Further, you say 
that many of the spells "focus on using existing abilities in unusual 
and interesting ways." Can you give examples of how that might work?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse:</b> Game elements like feats and spells should
 inspire. They should inspire new character concepts, they should 
inspire new encounters, and they should point the way toward more 
interesting options in the game. What should the average player get from
 the spells? I hope he or she walks away with a character idea or four, 
along with a double helping of options for an existing character. The 
spells that interact with skills encourage the use of skills in exciting
 situations. The sniper's eye spell, for example, encourages the use of 
the Hide skill to set up ranged sneak attacks. Other spells, like 
listening lorecall, have a greater effect if the caster has a high 
number of ranks in a related skill. Finally, some spells that are swift 
actions to cast allow you to make a specific skill check as a free 
action, giving you a real chance to use the skill in combat without 
having to forego valuable opportunities to attack foes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Organizations have really become front and center in </b>D&amp;D<b> lately, and<i> Complete Adventurer</i>
 offers some 30 pages of new organizations and, perhaps most 
interesting, how to build an organization. As a player or DM, what are 
your feelings about organizations? And what is the design philosophy 
behind including more DM-useful info about building an organization in a
 primarily player-focused book?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse:</b> I find that a campaign really comes alive 
when the characters have ties and loyalties beyond their adventuring 
companions. Organizations that appeal to players encourage them to 
become more involved in the DM's world. On the other side of the screen,
 organizations that have clear goals and well-established philosophies 
about the world help DMs keep their campaign consistent and help add 
elements of intrigue.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Finally, you always seem to have exciting 
projects on your plate. What are you working on now that you're at 
liberty to tell me about?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jesse:</b> After I wrote <i>Complete Adventurer,</i> I lead the design team on <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/177450000">Races of Eberron</a>,</i> and I really enjoyed the experience. Writing in <b>Eberron</b> was about the most interesting design work that I've done. After that, I did design work on <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/863170000">Dungeon Master's Guide II</a></i>.
 In the midst of that project, however, I took on a different set of 
challenges as the Development Manager for Roleplaying Games and 
Miniatures. The last six months or so have been filled with development 
work on products that will see print in 2005! </p>
