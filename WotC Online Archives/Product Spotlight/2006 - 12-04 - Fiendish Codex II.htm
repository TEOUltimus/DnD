In the interests of better involving the player community with the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, questions for this interview were solicited in part via the <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=10579221&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20061204a">message boards</a>. Our thanks to everyone who took the time to submit their fiendish questions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b> It may be unwise to study 
too closely the secrets of Hell, but we're willing to take those risks! 
To start with, how did your involvement with <i>Fiendish Codex II</i> begin? Did you have an interest in the subject matter from previous editions?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Robert J Schwalb:</b> I'm sort of typecast (grin). 
Ever since I became a freelance game designer, I've had a knack for 
landing jobs that dealt with evil subjects. Chris Perkins pinged me to 
work on <i>Fiendish Codex I</i>, but tragically I was swamped with a 
project for another company, and so I had to take a pass. I kicked 
myself. I wouldn't make that same mistake twice. So, I cleared my decks 
for this one. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-04%20-%20Fiendish%20Codex%20II_files/dx20061204_glasya.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="369" width="240"> As for an interest in devils, I've always been keen on the darker elements in the<b> D&amp;D</b>
 cosmology. Maybe it's because my mother freaked a bit (hi mom). Devils 
have been among the coolest for me since I got my hands on the 1st 
edition <i>Monster Manual</i>. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've had a fondness for Glasya since <i>Monster Manual 2</i>--what can I say, I like women with horns and tails. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Robin D Laws: </b> Anybody who grew up playing <b>AD&amp;D</b>
 in the late seventies and early eighties considers the big demons and 
devils to be the Big Kahunas of monsterdom. Every player dreamed of 
getting their characters powerful enough to take on Asmodeus and 
survive. Devils have always struck me as the coolest of infernal <b>D&amp;D</b>
 baddies, because they have an agenda and a culture--even though that 
has not been well defined until now. And I always appreciate 
opportunities to explore the nasty and gooey side of fantasy imagery.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> When it comes to past editions, Hell 
has undergone some definite revisions when it comes to rulers, history, 
the Blood War.... Can you tell us something of the nature of Hell as now
 presented in this book: such as what sources you followed, which 
elements you retained, which you revised, and which you jettisoned?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS:</b> Robin can say more, but the Nine Hells 
dispenses with a lot of the clutter, while retaining the flavor. The 
biggest and coolest change was removing the Hag Countess as an archdevil
 and replacing her with Glasya. The rest of the archdevils remain more 
or less the same--Baalzebub is still a slug, Levistus is trapped in ice,
 and Mephistopheles plots to overthrow Asmodeus.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RDL: </b> I was going to be much more circumspect 
about that! My plan for detailing the Nine Hells was to evolve the 
existing conception of the setting, not to discard it. When I ran into 
an element from the past I wasn't comfortable with, I downplayed it 
rather than cutting it out entirely. For example, the <i>Planescape</i> 
line made the Hells much more of a livable environment than I wanted. So
 I cut back on that concept somewhat, while still leaving traces of it 
for those who still want to recreate the <i>Planescape </i>vibe. 
Glasya's ascension is an example of evolving the existing materials. Her
 machinations have been foreshadowed in previous publications for years.
 Now she finally gets what she wanted. And the poor old Hag Countess 
doesn't get a comfortable retirement, either. This is important in 
portraying the Hells as both eternal but currently in the midst of big 
changes. The situation is in flux, giving PCs the chance to jump in and 
get involved in an unstable political situation.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> In my sections, I looked at a lot of materials, including the 1st edition <i>Monster Manuals</i> and <i>Manual of the Planes,</i> the Ed Greenwood articles in <i>Dragon</i> Magazine, <i>Faces of the Fiends, Planes of Law</i> and the rest of the <i>Planescape</i>
 setting sourcebooks, as well as the current materials that cover the 
Hells. There's a lot of stuff in the canon that would have been great to
 fit in, but much of it was contradictory, and some simply couldn't fit 
inside. One thing that we did not cover were the Ancient Baatorians. At 
some level, we assumed that the baatezu eliminated rival elements to 
reinforce their monolithic control of the Nine Hells. Through 
misinformation and propaganda, anything other than the baatezu has been 
relegated to something lesser. It doesn't matter if it's true or not; 
it's true to the baatezu, and their word is law.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-04%20-%20Fiendish%20Codex%20II_files/dx20061204_nessus.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="216" width="337"><b>Wizards: </b> Looking at Hell itself, does <i>FCII</i>
 cover all nine layers in detail? What type of material is presented? 
(If you were planning a vacation, what layer would be your first choice 
to visit?)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> All nine layers are covered. Naturally, the
 Hag Countess's layer has undergone the most significant changes. Robin 
handled the layer descriptions and details, so I'll let him handle this 
one. (Maladomini would be my vacation spot--chicks with horns and tails,
 remember? Oh, but Fierna's just a bit too creepy for me.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RDL: </b> You get basic geography, typical 
population, politics, roleplaying tips, encounters, and a focused look 
at a particular location, with map. Sometimes it's a map of a whole 
layer, like Nessus' surface canyons. Other times it's a city, or an 
installation. I made sure that all the layers were nasty in their own 
way, and would under no circumstances book a vacation to any part of the
 Hells. If I did my job right, every lawful PC will be on their best 
behavior from here on out, to avoid damnation. The Hells are a terrible 
place to spend eternity. And those chicks with the horns and tails seem 
like fun at first, but believe me, you don't want to hook up with them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> And there are the Lords of the Nine Layers: one concern players had with <i>FCI</i> regarded the Demon Lords; many felt their Challenge Ratings were artificially weakened. How are <i>FCII</i>'s
 Lords of the Nine Layers handled? Are these the actual lords, or 
aspects more suitable for a high-level party to (someday) meet? Other 
than their CRs, have their stats changed from previous incarnations?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> This was a tricky issue. This time around, 
we were very clear to make sure everyone knows that the Archdevils 
presented were all aspects. To be honest, I too think Asmodeus should be
 a CR "silly-huge" bad guy with all the bells and whistles, but, 
seriously, who'd use him? The number of players out there that run 
66th-level characters are relatively miniscule to the folks playing 
characters between 6th and 15th. By presenting the archdevils as 
aspects, we preserved them as great campaign ending bad-guys, but 
without emasculating them. Oh, and the aspect of Asmodeus has a CR 27.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As for statistics, there are some changes. I tried to 
streamline the opponents in such a way as to make them easier to use, 
while retaining their fearsome capabilities. For example, Asmodeus still
 has the <i>ruby rod</i> he's described as having in the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>. Whether this is the real thing or a facsimile of something far more powerful, that's for DMs to decide.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-04%20-%20Fiendish%20Codex%20II_files/dx20061204_asmodeus.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="298" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b> In the recent <i>FCII</i>
 preview, there's the quote: "When his final plans fall into place, 
Asmodeus intends to punish his former masters of the celestial sphere 
for daring to look down upon the foot soldiers who did all the dirty 
work." Does this mean that we'll learn a bit of Asmodeus's "true" 
origins (which have changed between sources, such as 2nd editions <i>Guide to Hell</i>, and 2nd edition's <i>Hellbound</i>)?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS:</b> Robin handled the history and origins of the Nine Hells, so I'll leave it to him to flesh out. The short answer is yes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RDL: </b> The slightly longer answer is maybe. The 
words "true" and "devils" never belong together in the same sentence. 
The book kicks off with an origin myth for Asmodeus. It is described as 
being, like any proper myth, true--whether it happened or not. That 
said, the <b>D&amp;D</b> take on the myth of The Fall is my favorite part of the book.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Speaking of the lords, is there any mention of Hell's former rulers: namely Geryon (last seen in the <i>Tome of Magic</i> as a vestige), and Moloch?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> Mention, yes. Much detail, no. There are 
nuggets for many of Hell's former rulers scattered throughout the book, 
but we chose to focus our attention on the active agents of evil, rather
 than on those dead, buried, or transformed into vestiges (<i>Tome of Magic</i> covered most of these folks rather well, I think).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Then there's Tiamat, former ruler of Hell's first layer; has she regained her throne?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> Tiamat is an interesting case. Since she's a
 goddess, and having been discussed at great length in several other 
sourcebooks, we didn't spend a lot of time on her. Bel kept his seat and
 he's still having trouble with the other archdevils (they don't trust 
him since he double-crossed his predecessor). He's brokered a deal with 
Tiamat to gain use of the abishai, though what the goddess of chromatic 
gains in exchange remains a mystery. Propped up by her favor and that of
 the Dark Eight, Bel's place seems secure... for now.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Beyond the lords, what does <i>Fiendish Codex II</i> mention of the other denizens: such as the dukes, or the Dark Eight?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS:</b> We focused our attention on the active 
masters of the Nine Hells. There are a few mentions of past dukes (or 
prince or some other hellish noble) here and there, but most of this 
information is in <i>Tome of Magic: Pact, Shadow, and True Name Magic</i>. You'll find the archdevils of the Nine Hells are rather vigilant in dealing with upstarts and rivals.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RDL:</b> Along with the very top guys, the sample 
encounters present hellish denizens of various challenge ratings. You 
get to meet, by example, the various local rulers and functionaries an 
average adventuring party is likely to be handle--or at least interact 
with. In a way, it's more important to see examples of middle-ranking 
devils than more great big guys who can squish all but the buffest 
parties.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-04%20-%20Fiendish%20Codex%20II_files/dx20061204_nupperibo.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="294" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b>
 When it comes to the devils themselves, does the book offer conversions
 of previous monsters (such as the nupperibo)? What of new, previously 
unknown devils? Is there any information on those infernal war engines 
powered by the pain of torture?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> Absolutely. There was some early discussion
 as to whether it would be worth including the nupperibo since, 
mechanically, they are quite similar to lemures, but I'm pleased to say 
that my favorite, bloated, blind, mute fiend made the cut. We took the 
chance to update some 3rd edition devils found in previous sourcebooks, 
such as the narzugon and spined devil (spinagon), bringing them in line 
with the 3.5 rules as well as to tweak and slightly modify their 
abilities to make them more useful in play. The new monster format gave 
me a lot more room to discuss the nature, character, and motives of 
these fiends, giving them their proper due.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As for new devils, there are all sorts of disturbing 
things in this book. The dogai (or assassin devil) serve as Hell's hit 
men. Robin came up with the harvester devil, a fiend that specializes in
 making diabolical pacts. The hellfire engine covers the infernal war 
machine. The vicious ayperobos swarm is a crowd of tiny devils that like
 little fat hairy humanoids with big leering mouths. Oh, and there's a 
new devil that's made from the awakened flesh of the Hag Countess. Mmmm 
tasty.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RDL:</b> The harvester devil fills a necessary hole 
in diabolical imagery--the classic slick-talking fiend who wants to sign
 you to a Faustian pact. Much of my section on devil culture is devoted 
to explaining their economy, which provides you with their reasons for 
working their evil schemes throughout the material plane. You find out 
why devils gather souls, what they do with them, and how the corruption 
of souls fuels their entire evil society. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> So far, this has all been about the devils. When it comes to the players, what does <i>Fiendish Codex II</i>
 have in store for them: are there any new prestige classes, feats, 
spells? And are these geared for PCs fighting devils, or for the more 
fiendish-minded PC?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-04%20-%20Fiendish%20Codex%20II_files/dx20061204_warlock.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="301" width="225"><b>RJS: </b> There sure are! For feats, we built on the solid foundation set forth by the <i>FCI</i>,
 and presented a new category of feats called devil-touched feats. 
Devil-Touched is a doorway to gaining new feats that get better with the
 more devil-touched feats you select. We slipped in a few divine feats 
for those clerics and paladins who specialize in fighting devils, and a 
metamagic feat called Disrupting Spell that reduces the save DC of 
spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities--perfect for 
defusing devilish abilities. We introduced a number of feats for devils 
that grant them cool abilities based on their allegiance to a particular
 archdevil, giving DMs additional tools for customizing their devils.</p>
<p align="LEFT">We fit in four prestige classes. All, naturally, deal 
with devils in some way or another. The hellbreaker specializes in 
breaking into and out of the Nine Hells to filch from the baatezu. He 
has a number of abilities designed to minimize or interfere with the 
common abilities used by devils. For warlock fans, I designed the 
hellfire warlock. This nasty class gives PCs the ability to increase 
their eldritch blast with raw hellfire at the expense of their soul. 
There's also the hellreaver, a sexy class for paladins, who channels his
 outrage and fury into special abilities that give him specific 
resistances and combat buffs for fighting evil outsiders. Finally, we 
have the soulguard. This cat's shtick is fighting and defeating 
diabolical pacts and mortals in the service of these terrible foes. </p>
<p align="LEFT">We also had room for some new spells too. Most of these 
are investiture spells. These allow a caster to infuse the essence of a 
devil into a mortal, giving him a suite of abilities that replicate or 
evoke the abilities of the associated fiend. We offer plenty, but 
creative DMs can build additional ones using those included as a guide.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Plus, there's a new PC race in town, we
 hear. What can you tell us about the hellbred? A force of virtue? Or a 
force of fiendish might?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS:</b> The hellbred race is a great way for players
 to use much of the material presented in this book and others without 
having the character be evil. These characters are reborn after the 
moment of death, when they earnestly repented for the mortal failings. 
Since devils are unwilling to release such a choice morsel, they fight 
for the soul, twisting and transforming it into something new. Their 
bodies are corrupted twisted by evil, yet the gods cleanse their souls, 
freeing them of the taint and corruption that plagued them in life. 
These are doomed characters that fight for their redemption.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Given their unique nature, hellbreds have several cool 
racial features. They gain evil's exception, an ability that allows them
 to utilize evil magic items and spells without picking up those pesky 
negative levels. As they advance, they also acquire additional 
abilities, letting them develop devilish traits. In short, the hellbred 
is a great option for player's looking to play doomed champions, 
anti-heroes, and other dark and gloomy characters without having to play
 an evil alignment.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-04%20-%20Fiendish%20Codex%20II_files/dx20061204_hell.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="364" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b> As a final question, have you played in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 campaigns that have ventured into Hell, either as the player or the DM?
 Any special memories from those games? Any advice for parties making 
that extreme trek, or for DMs attempting to run such games?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RJS: </b> A descent into the Nine Hells is classic <b>D&amp;D</b>
 . That picture of the paladin fighting for his life against a group of 
devils inspired my style of gaming--violent, cruel, and nasty. Asmodeus 
and other archdevils long served as prominent villains in my campaigns. 
In fact, the epic decade-long mega-campaign I ran from the start of 2nd 
edition through the first heady months of 3rd saw Asmodeus as one of the
 villainous principles. I can't go into too much detail about Asmodeus's
 interactions with a certain lawful evil conjurer, but it was... well...
 graphic.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Nine Hells is a great playground for DMs. It's a 
perfect place to set a sweeping campaign, thrusting the player 
characters into the heart of the Blood War, fighting their way through a
 sea of demons only to find themselves ensnared by the treacherous 
politicking of the baatezu. Since the Hells have only nine layers and 
nine archdevils, as a setting, this plane gives DM's a finite playing 
field and injects political intrigue, grotesque violence, treachery, 
deceit, terrible bargains, and a healthy dose of totalitarian rule. 
Whether the PCs are fighting their way out of Hell, rescuing a mortal 
wrongly held there, or simply taking the fight to the fiends, there are 
endless opportunities for DMs to work their magic.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For players, just remember this. You might think it's 
cool and brave and heroic to descend into the depths of this plane and 
fight the good fight. But remember, when it comes to the baatezu, they 
don't let anything happen that they don't want to happen in the first 
place. You might think you're doing a great service to the planes by 
butchering some bad guys, but someone down there--probably an 
archdevil--is benefiting from your invasion. Do you really want to do 
the dirty work of the baatezu? Don't let me stop you; just watch your 
backs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>RDL:</b> My playtest campaign remained solidly 
earthbound. A journey to Hell is great, but there's so much you can do 
with devilkind on the PCs' home turf. They're intelligent enemies, so 
they break the inherent contract between <b>D&amp;D</b> adventurer and 
the monsters. They don't wait around waiting for you to come bust down 
their dungeon doors and take their loot. If you take their stuff--which 
they need to gather souls--they come after you. They bust down your 
door. And they keep coming. They even kill your companion animals.
