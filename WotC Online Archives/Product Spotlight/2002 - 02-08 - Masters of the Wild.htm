 sourcebook for barbarians, rangers, and druids bring new meaning to the
 word "wild." And Wizards of the Coast assumes no responsibility for the
 following . . .</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Where did you begin in putting together <i>Masters of the Wild</i>? Did you return to earlier D&amp;D works to create a foundation?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave Eckelberry:</b>Well, we started by doing a lot of research, looking at some of --</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Mike Selinker:</b> Hey! Just because you wrote 49 
pages and I only wrote 47 doesn't mean you get to hog all the spotlight,
 Eck. Might I point out that three of your pages were the credits and 
table of contents? I mean, if anybody --</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Uh, Mike, people are reading this 
now. Okay, as I was saying, we looked at much of the previously 
published material on the "nature classes," but spent more time 
examining how the subjects of this book work in the new <b>D&amp;D</b>. Since we had a bit more time post-release of the new edition of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 than the other books in this series, we were able to listen to people 
we gamed with and to fans we met online and at conventions. They had a 
lot of things to say about what we'd be dealing with in <i>Masters of the Wild</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Uh-huh. A few minutes ago, you were 
saying, "We started when they said, 'Here's your paycheck.'" In fact, 
that's the only reason you're sitting here with me right now.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Whatever. Next question.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Okay, then. How about this -- some players 
feel that barbarians, druids, and rangers tend to be "outsiders" in the 
D&amp;D world. How does <i>Masters of the Wild</i> address that issue?</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="2002%20-%2002-08%20-%20Masters%20of%20the%20Wild_files/mow_med.jpg" border="0"></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> We felt it necessary to get in touch 
with our inner nature-lover. We got a drum, some blue face-paint, and a 
VW Microbus, and headed off to the rain forest. Dave really learned 
something about himself that day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> I wasn't there. I deny everything. But you looked good with your beard painted blue.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> After we got back, we realized that 
Mother Nature was deeply offended that druids, rangers, and barbarians 
hadn't gotten the treatment they deserved in <b>D&amp;D</b>. Blame it on
 designing the game in the shadow of Boeing and Microsoft. So we brought
 the characters back to the center: How did they fit into the 
adventuring world? What could they do to help their allies? Who were 
these guys?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> After a great deal of analysis, we 
came to the conclusion that barbarians hit things with oversized blunt 
objects, rangers shot things with pointy arrows, and druids changed into
 lions -- but they couldn't rend or pounce.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Yup. We fixed that.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Finally. Next question?</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: So, which of the three classes did you find to be the toughest to develop material for? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b><i></i>Well, the ranger sucked. Hell, even Monte Cook wrote a new one. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> The druid sucked more.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Really? You think so?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Hello? Look at the cleric. How did the druid not suck?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> I wasn't saying the druid didn't 
suck. Close race between the two of them. Ironically, that was part of 
the problem when we sat down to start writing. We could see a good dozen
 ways to develop (read here: improve) the ranger and the druid, but the 
barbarian chugs along just fine with his greataxe and loincloth.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Pretty dull, though, just hitting things all the time.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> You ever play this game?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Let's try this direction instead: For the 
players who've had some experience with each class, what will they find 
in the book that's new about barbarians, druids, and rangers? Prestige 
classes? Feats?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Yup.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Lots. Spells and equipment, too.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Hmmm. All right then. Uh, so, how did the new edition of D&amp;D help or hinder your development of this guidebook?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Well, without the new <b>D&amp;D</b>, we wouldn't have done this book, you see.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Punk. Show some dignity. Look, when you write a book like this, you have to throw the previous editions' books away --</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Wheee!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> -- and focus on what the rules 
actually say. So you've got an animal companion: What can you do with 
it? What do you do with it when it's no longer useful? Do you have to 
say good-bye to Fluffy? Poor, poor Fluffy. . .</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Who the hell is Fluffy?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Uh, sorry. Childhood flashback. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Are we about done? I have to wash my dog and scrub my bathroom tiling tonight.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: In that case, we're almost done here. You 
know, it's always interesting to hear designers' takes on their work. If
 you were to come at <i>Masters of the Wild</i> as a player, what would 
you find most exciting? Would you favor one of these classes over 
another, based on what the guidebook contains?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> If I were a barbarian, I think I'd 
be bouncing up and down with heathen joy. The new ways to use rage, the 
new combat feats, and some brutal new weapons and equipment make him 
deadlier than ever.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> My favorite's the druid. My 20th-level
 evil druid can now cast a bunch more new spells, including one that 
might just wipe out the world on a series of good rolls. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Hey, what about the ranger?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Well, there are only two of us, you know. But in the spirit of fairness, the ranger's my favorite.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> Mine, too.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Okay, do you have any favorites among the 
book's new feats, weapons, animals (in particular, the dire and 
legendary ones), prestige classes, and spells? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> It generally helps us to speak in chart form.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Cross-referenced answers -- a first for this column. So, did any material end up on the cutting room floor?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> Our original title for the book. We wanted to call it "Get the Hell off My Lawn."</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> There were a few things we talked 
about doing but didn't find time or space to complete, but just about 
everything we wanted to do early on we accomplished. If I had more pages
 and time, I'd probably do another prestige class for druid spellcasters
 and some more legendary animals.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> That's what it's all about, isn't it? More pages for you.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eckelberry:</b> That's it. I'm outta here.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Wait, Dave. Just one more question. Can you
 tell us about the process of working together on a project? Do the two 
of you simply divide up the book into pieces, or do you work together on
 certain sections?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Selinker:</b> We don't work together if we can help it. Right, Dave? Dave?</p>
