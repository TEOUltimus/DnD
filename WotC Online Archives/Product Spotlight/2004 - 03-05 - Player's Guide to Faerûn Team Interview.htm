<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: The introduction to the <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i> says that one of the book's primary purposes was to update the </b>Forgotten Realms<b> setting for v.3.5 </b>D&amp;D <b>rules. How complicated was that transition? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James Wyatt:</b> I've worked on a lot of 3.5 updates now: I did the updates for <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881650000">Deities &amp; Demigods</a></i>, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882680000">Monster Manual II</a></i>, and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/886610000">Fiend Folio</a></i> in the revision update booklet, and my update of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882440000">Oriental Adventures</a></i> will be in the <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20040305a">April issue of <b>Dragon</b></a></p>
<p align="LEFT"> }}magazine. The <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i><b></b>is really a different beast than any of those, more akin to what Andy Collins did with the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/175240000">Player's Handbook</a></i>.
 With the others, the goal was simply to find the places where the new 
rules had created an inconsistency and then fix those places -- making 
sure monsters have all the right skills and feats, for example. With the
 <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i>, we really went through all the rules for FR in 3.0 with the same kind of attention that Andy gave to the <i>Player's Handbook</i>,
 catching not just inconsistencies with the 3.5 rules but trying to 
improve all the rules across the board. So, a lot of spells that didn't 
quite work the way we wanted them to were updated. We weren't happy with
 the regional feat system, so that got an overhaul. Deity-specific 
spells had lost their particular flavor in 3.0, so we brought them back 
(to some extent). That sort of thing.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis Stout</b>: Speaking strictly from my perspective, the update wasn't hugely complicated. Most of my work involved updating the 3.0 <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000">Forgotten Realms</a></b></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000"><i>Campaign Setting</i></a><i></i>prestige
 classes, which in my opinion were already some of the best prestige 
classes in the game to that point. Most of the changes there were small 
things: correcting skill lists, bringing certain abilities into line 
with the revision, and the like. I also took the opportunity to make a 
few changes to help these classes fit with the new rules presented in 
this book. The hathran and the Harper scout (now called the Harper 
agent) got pretty major overhauls, though the Harper agent ended up 
fairly close to its original state after editing. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich Baker:</b> In the end, the transition really 
wasn't that hard, but it was necessary. For example, we rethought spell 
save DCs in 3.5, and concluded that "spell power" and similar 
DC-boosting prestige class abilities or feats were simply too good. So, 
most of the "spell power"-granting prestige classes were changed to 
offer caster-level boosts instead -- still good, but not as likely to 
result in save-or-die spells with unbeatable DCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: You also updated some 1st and 2nd Edition </b>Forgotten Realms<b> material that hadn't been brought up to code. </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis:</b> In terms of the 1E and 2E material, I was
 really quite surprised at how easy it was to update. It really says 
something about the versatility of 3.5 that 95 percent of the time, a 
spell or magic item's effects from older editions slid right into the 
new rules. There were several cases where a spell effect from a 2nd 
Edition source that was originally half a page or more was easily 
condensed down to a few lines because there was already a status effect 
or a rule subset in 3.5 that did the same thing.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b>The older material included some materials from the 2nd Edition <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Adventures</i> hardbound, <i>Volo's Guide to All Things Magical</i>, <i>Hellgate Keep</i>, <i>Seven Sisters</i>, and other sources that hadn't been mined very deeply for <b>Forgotten Realms</b> 3.0. So, we've got items such as the Baneblades of Demron, some of the old unique swords, and spells such as <i>howling chain, ruby ray of reversal</i>, and <i>skull watch</i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The book's introduction identifies its other
 primary purpose as serving "as a player's single best collection of 
Faerûnian lore and arcana for building an infinite variety of 
characters." To this end, you've supplied a nice list of other </b>Forgotten Realms<b> products and how 3.5 affected them. What distinguishes <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i> from these other products to make it the single best collection?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> One-stop shopping. We had to make a tough call with this book. We were updating so much of the core <b>Forgotten Realms</b> material that it started to feel like we'd better reprint even the material that we <i>weren't</i> updating. It would have been awkward for players to make characters, knowing that they had to check everything in <i>two</i> books because what was in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b></i><i>Campaign Setting </i>might have been updated in <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i>. So, even material from the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b></i><i>Campaign Setting </i>that didn't change much or at all, such as core racial abilities, was reprinted in this book. It doesn't make the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b></i><i>Campaign Setting </i>obsolete
 -- it's still the best and only source for all that geography and real 
setting material -- but it does provide one handy location for 
everything you need to build a character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis:</b> I think the sheer volume of <i>stuff</i> 
in this book really sets it apart. This book has everything, from 
regional feats (which have an entirely new rule system to support them 
now) to prestige classes to spells and magic -- and that's just the 
first three chapters! As James pointed out, this is also the first time a
 <b>Forgotten Realms</b> product has gone in-depth about how to use content from the general <b>D&amp;D</b> product line in your <b>Forgotten Realms </b>campaign. The epic content and the vile and exalted content are my personal favorites, but all of it's useful and cool.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> The <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i> really is the book that brings <b>Forgotten Realms</b> fully into <b>D&amp;D</b>
 v.3.5. The convenience of collecting so much character generation 
information and character options (such as spells) in one place really 
can't be overstated. Before you might have been toting the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882410000">Magic of Faerûn</a></i>, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/886430000">Faiths &amp; Pantheons</a></i>, and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/885780000">Races of Faerûn</a></i> to your <b>Forgotten Realms</b> game. The <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i> collects and updates much of the information in these books in one consistent and convenient spot.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: How did you balance updating material with introducing new stuff?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James</b>: We couldn't have justified making this 
book if it had been just a collection of old material, even updated. If 
that had been the approach we wanted to take, we would have put a free 
update on our website like we did with the accessory update. In early 
concepting of the book, we came up with the idea of presenting -- for 
the first time -- rules about how to use some of the other core <b>D&amp;D</b> products in your <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 game. So we included rules about psionics, planes, exalted deeds and 
vile darkness, and epic-level play. That was what got me excited about 
working on the project in the first place. The rest was just gravy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis</b>: Well, I was brought on after most of the 
book's content was pretty finalized, so I wasn't really involved in 
those decisions. Just within my own work, though, I tried to approach 
things from the angle of "Am I changing this because it needs to change 
to bring this in line with 3.5, or just because I think it's neat?" 95 
percent of the time, if it was just "neat," it didn't make it in. For 
example, at one point I tried to reword the divine champion's 
requirements so that you could swap out Weapon Focus in the deity's 
favored weapon for Weapon Focus in an alignment weapon (à la the <i>spiritual weapon</i>
 spell). Ultimately, though, it just proved confusing and generally 
extraneous, so it was dropped. It can be a big temptation for designers,
 as gamers, to want to put our house rules into a rulebook and make them
 official!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> We started by carefully comparing the <b>D&amp;D</b> v.3.5 core rulebooks with the existing <b>Forgotten Realms</b> sourcebooks and identifying things that had to be addressed. For example, the <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i> picked up the Stealthy feat from the <i><b>Forgotten Realms </b>Campaign Setting</i>,
 so Stealthy no longer made sense as a regional feat -- anyone could 
take it now. We needed a replacement for Stealthy. Similarly, we 
examined prestige classes, spells, and other <b>Forgotten Realms</b> "stuff" to see what needed to be brought in line with 3.5. After that, we went to the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=rpga">RPGA</a> and our errata files to find things that hadn't been working well in play and could stand another take.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As James said, we wanted to make sure that this book was
 something more than material you'd seen before, so we tried hard to 
shoot for 50 percent new content. We didn't quite get there, but even 
with the updated older content, it's often the case that we've got 
interesting new takes or streamlined mechanics that make it new all over
 again.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: How did the three of you work together? Did you divide up the work by sections or all work together on particular bits?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> Let's see. I did the races, Rich did the 
overhaul of the regional feats, and we each did some prestige classes. 
We divvied up spells and magic items as well. Our development team 
(Andrew Finch, Mike Donais, and David Noonan) did a lot of the work on 
revising spells. I did the bulk of the work on vile/exalted, planar, and
 epic stuff. Dave Noonan actually wrote the psionics stuff during his 
time developing the book. And Travis did the campaign journal at the 
end.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis:</b> Mostly we split the book up by sections 
-- it can be hard to collaborate when designers are on opposite ends of 
the country! The sections we did split amongst ourselves were generally 
discrete elements with little overlap, like prestige classes. My work 
was mostly on prestige classes (updating a lot of the old <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 ones and adding some of the new ones), spells (new spells and spells 
imported from 2nd Edition sources), and magic items (again, updating 
from 1st and 2nd Editions). I also, as James pointed out, wrote the 
Campaign Journal chapter, which discusses the recent major events 
detailed in the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frnovel/218010000">Return of the Archwizards trilogy</a> and the first three books of the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frnovel/885540000">War of the Spider Queen</a> series.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> My major contribution to the book was the 
overhaul and redesign of the regional feat system. That was a very 
involved bit of work that took me quite some time. I also collated a 
number of the spells and did some prep work for the developers there. 
Ironically, the other major section I worked on (monsters) was cut for 
space. Fortunately, we've got an upcoming product that they'll fit in 
just fine. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: For the player well versed in both </b>Forgotten Realms<b> products and v.3.5, what are some of the highlights of this particular edition -- either brand-new material or updated work?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> I'm still most excited about the new possibilities for planar adventuring in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> cosmology. We made some tweaks to the cosmology presented in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>,
 listening to some of the questions and complaints that came up on the 
message boards and mailing lists. Giving the planes the full treatment 
was a lot of fun to do. I'd like to play in an adventure that takes me 
to Warrior's Rest!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis:</b> I think a lot of people are going to love
 the new regional feats. They've really been punched up, and now they 
are tempting options that easily compete with staples like Power Attack 
and Spell Focus as choices for 1st-level characters. Getting to see some
 of the classic Netherese spells like <i>Proctiv's move mountain</i> and elven high magic like <i>gift of alliance</i> treated in epic format is quite cool as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> In the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>, we covered the notion of regional feats (regions, plus the feats themselves) in only 10 pages. In the <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i>,
 we gave this section almost 40 pages. We really tore down this idea to 
its foundation, thought hard about what we wanted it to do, and gave it 
the lavish attention it deserved from the get-go. It's not just 
mechanics, either; there's a brief text description of every region that
 tells you exactly what it's trying to cover and introduces the place to
 the player.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Players will undoubtedly find the comprehensive spell lists -- which outline all the spells from a wide variety of </b>Forgotten Realms<b>
 sources -- valuable as a quick-reference guide for locating them. As 
you reviewed most, if not all, of those spells, was this an opportunity 
to really overhaul the functionality of any of them, making them a 
noticeably different spell than how they originally appeared?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> As I noted before, we had a lot of feedback
 from the RPGA and our players regarding which spells were problematic 
and which were underpowered. We also took steps to simplify some older 
spells that had pretty complex descriptions and mechanics, to "cut to 
the chase" and be clear about what the spell was for and how it worked.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i></b><b>has
 a quite extensive section on planes and their traits, links, 
inhabitants, and features. How did you determine the depth of detail 
needed for this particular cosmology without repeating too much material
 from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882420000">Manual of the Planes</a></i>? </b><b>And
 in general, did you find it challenging to not repeat wholesale 
material from other sources in trying to outline new material for the <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn</i>?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> The <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">3.5 <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i></a> presented the planes in a more&amp;nbsp;streamlined format than the one in <i>Manual of the Planes</i>, and that's the basic format I went with in presenting the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 cosmology. It was tough work, and ended up being a lot longer (and 
taking a lot more time) than I had planned. Building a planar cosmology 
involves a lot of creative piecing together of some pretty standard 
components: energy dominant traits, alignment traits, that sort of 
thing. I created one new kind of trait for the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> 
cosmology (faith traits), so that gave me a new component to play with. 
The planes that are very similar to their core counterparts got no 
treatment in the book -- there's no discussion of the elemental planes, 
for example. Hell and the Abyss got shorter entries because they're very
 similar to the core planes. For the rest, I pieced together a lot of 
information from 2nd Edition sources like the <i>Faiths &amp; Avatars</i> series and the <b>Planescape</b> setting that described the homes of the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 deities. I tried to put inventive new twists in as much as I could. But
 yeah, it was challenging as Fury's Heart to put it all together.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Do you have a favorite contribution to the <i>Player's Guide to Faerûn </i>-- something that you were particularly proud of? Which contributions from the other designers particularly impressed you? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> Well, I guess you've probably figured out 
by now that I'm particularly proud of the planar material. I'm also 
really happy with many of the prestige classes I did for this book, 
particularly the vile and exalted ones. I'm really pleased with the new 
regional feats that Rich did, and I'm really glad the campaign journal 
is in there, giving an update on what's been happening in the setting 
lately.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis:</b> I think my personal favorite contribution
 to the book was the justicar of Tyr prestige class. Tyrran paladins 
have been one of my favorite <b>Forgotten Realms</b> character 
archetypes since I first started playing in the Realms about six years 
ago, so getting a chance to write a prestige class tailored to that was a
 lot of fun. As far as the other designers' contributions go, I really 
like the new regional feat system that Rich designed -- and that's about
 really all I can say at the moment, because the FedEx man just 
delivered my copy of the finished book five minutes ago, and I haven't 
had a chance to read it thoroughly yet!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> My favorite part was finally getting the 
space to do justice to the regional feat system. As far as the other 
guys' contributions, I really enjoyed seeing James pull all the 
cosmology together -- it's truly outstanding, something the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> fans have been clamoring for for some time. And Travis did excellent work on the magic items and prestige classes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Were there things you'd hoped to include that just didn't make the cut? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> Lots of good stuff got squeezed out, like some new archfiends, but we're trying to find a home for all the orphaned material.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis: </b>I was a little disappointed that my 
write-ups of the three Coronal blades of Myth Drannor didn't make it in,
 but I think I can squeeze them into my next project!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b>As I mentioned before, we had a monster 
chapter that was squeezed out for space, but we hope to get those 
critters in front of everyone soon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Finally, what are each of you working on now?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>James:</b> I am finishing up work on a book for the <b>d20 Modern</b>
 line, and started a new project in February that I'm really excited 
about. It's something entirely new that's never been done in <b>D&amp;D</b> before, and I can hardly wait to get started working on it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich:</b> I'm working on a core <b>D&amp;D</b> book that I can't really talk about yet, as it's too far down the pipeline. At home, I'm finishing the rewrites for my novel <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frnovel/965620000">Forsaken House</a></i>, . first in The Last Mythal trilogy</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Travis:</b> I'm currently working on another <b>Forgotten Realms</b> product that I think a lot of gamers are going to find very useful. After that, I've got two <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=rpga/membership/polyhedron">Polyhedron</a></i> mini-games and a few <b>Dragon</b> articles to write, and by then it should be about time to go to Gen Con and get more work!</p>
