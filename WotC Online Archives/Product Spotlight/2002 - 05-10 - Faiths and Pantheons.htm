<p class="size2"><b>Wizards of the Coast: So much material has already been written about the gods and religions of the </b>Forgotten Realms. <b>How did you begin to compile all the bits and pieces of this well-developed campaign setting?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean Reynolds:</b> One thing that I had to do as the developer for <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i> was to check the material written for this book against the text in the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000">Forgotten Realms</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000"> Campaign Setting</a></i>. When the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting </i>was being written, we deliberately made some updates to some of the deities to reflect new options in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 rules and to deal with strange elements that had crept into the deity 
information over time. Some of these changes weren't overt in the 
campaign setting deity listings, so Eric and Erik had no way to know 
that we had made these changes--it was up to me to make sure that these 
subtle undercurrents came through in any new information we presented.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric Boyd:</b> This time around it was actually easier than most projects, because <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/forgottenrealms/FR_Bios_JuliaM.asp">Julia Martin</a> and I had already collated most of the "in print" Realms material relating to deities during the development process for <i>Faiths and Avatars</i>, <i>Powers and Pantheons</i>, and <i>Demihuman Deities</i>. So most of the research for <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i> consisted of consulting the latest sources plus those three compilations.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik Mona:</b> I'd already read the first trilogy of
 2nd Edition god books, so I had a pretty good foundation. Eric Boyd and
 Julia Martin did a lot of the super-heavy lifting--tracking down 
ancient <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=rpga/publications">Polyhedron</a></i> articles or old <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/forgottenrealms/FR_Bios_EdG.asp">Ed Greenwood</a>
 convention handouts--back when they were doing this the first time 
around. That left me to pick and choose what I needed to look up as I 
went through my chosen deities. My desk was piled about two feet high in
 <b>Forgotten Realms </b>books. It was what they call "research intensive."</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What new material will players already familiar with Toril's religions find in this book?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> I'll let the other guys talk about the 
juicy prestige class goodness and the monstrous deity statistics. 
Personally, I accepted the job because I thought it would make an 
interesting challenge. Under <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/forgottenrealms/FR_Bios_RichB.asp">Rich Baker's</a> guidance, the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 in-house design team had just finished working on the campaign setting,
 and had applied a new sort of vision to the Realms that I found very 
appealing from a design perspective.</p>
<p class="size2">The setting had been around forever, with design work 
coming from hundreds of different staffers and freelancers. Often, 
that's a pretty big burden, since few of those people were working from 
the same blueprint. It's sometimes difficult to work in a world that 
spans the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frgiftset/883950000">Dark Elf Trilogy</a></i> and <i>Once Around the Realms,</i> for instance.</p>
<p class="size2">The new design ethic was to focus on building the 
Realms into an interesting campaign setting for players and DMs, above 
and beyond an adherence to old material so far out of date a modern-day 
graduate student could have been in grade school when it first went out 
of print. So I did my best to infuse deities like Deneir, Selune, and 
even poor little Cyrrollalee with interesting, occasionally challenging 
ideas that they hadn't been exposed to in the long history of the 
Realms. When ground has been covered eleven times before, it's really 
tempting to just parrot older material, changing the exact wording but 
not worrying too much about updating the gears that make that material 
work. For <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i>, I tried to tear some of these 
gods (particularly some of the lamer ones) to their core concepts and 
build up from there. That's not to say they're so different as to be 
unrecognizable--they're the same deities, but some of them have new, 
hopefully interesting aspects to their characters and motivations that 
haven't been revealed until now.</p>
<p class="size2">The rules junkies will have a lot of things in this 
book to make them salivate. If I did my job well, the roleplaying and 
world-builder types will find a lot to be happy about, too.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2005-10%20-%20Faiths%20and%20Pantheons_files/fnp_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="228" width="189">Wizards: There are a number of playtesters listed in <i>Faiths and Pantheons.</i> How do playtesters interact with text that's primarily historical overviews and statistics?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean:</b> Most of the playtesters involved were 
checking the new prestige classes for this book. We did have a couple of
 people that looked at it for continuity with previous material, but 
because Eric worked on the last iteration of the deity books and Erik 
does a lot of research before he writes, we were confident that 
historical accuracy wasn't going to be a problem. <br><b>Wizards: How did the new </b>D&amp;D<b> game rules impact the design and development of this book? Were they more help or hindrance?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric:</b> The generic "cleric" really came alive in 2nd Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b>
 with the concept of the specialty priest. However, without the 
underlying principles of balance found in the 3rd Edition, many of those
 specialty priests ended up very unbalanced from a play perspective. In 
my mind, 3rd Edition allows the creation of all manner of custom clerics
 (or other characters), but in a very play-balanced way. You'll see that
 influence on the prestige classes found in <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i>, and that respect 3rd Edition was certainly a great help.</p>
<p class="size2">Third Edition also had a big influence on the design of the deity avatars. <i>Deities and Demigods</i>
 lays out a comprehensive system for determining the abilities of 
deities, and that product played a crucial role in the design of the 
various avatars found in <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i>. You won't need that product to use the statistic blocks given in <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i>, but it will help individual DMs do their own write-ups for the "non-big-30" gods.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> They were more of a help, in my opinion 
too. I always liked the idea of specialty priests from the first time 
around, but more than anything else they probably exemplify the play 
balance problems of 2nd Edition. (My experience with the RPGA's <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.livingcity.organizedplay.com/">Living</a></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.livingcity.organizedplay.com/"><i>City</i></a> campaign, where specialty priests are perhaps the most common class, seems to prove this.) For <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i>,
 it was easy to play with ideas for prestige classes that wouldn't be 
appropriate, in terms of power or even concept, for a 1st-level 
character.</p>
<p class="size2">Also, 3rd Edition gives us a renewed focus on adventuring and actually playing <b>D&amp;D</b>
 as opposed to sitting around a table and talking about the game. I 
found that certain gods, particularly about half of the halfling 
pantheon and human gods such as Lliira and Deneir and Oghma, really 
weren't all that interesting in the dungeon or on the battlefield. 
That's fine to a point--Lliira's a pacifist and the bulk of her clerics 
should remain so--but there was a lot of deific "dead weight" in the 
pantheon that screamed out for a new angle to make them appropriate 
patrons for a series of <i>game</i> supplements.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean:</b> Because this book was designed by two 
people that aren't on Wizards' R&amp;D team, they were at a disadvantage
 when it came to designing the rules material simply because they 
weren't constantly involved with the design process of the new game. 
There are many unwritten rules for <b>D&amp;D</b> designing--things to 
avoid and things to remember that aren't in any of the books--and 
without that in-house training, it is easy for an outside designer to 
run into problems. Fortunately, Eric playtested the new <b>D&amp;D</b> while it was being developed, Erik studies hard, and they're both unafraid to ask questions.</p>
<p class="size2">As Erik said, play balance was a big issue for this book. The 2nd Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b>
 kit system made it very difficult to balance certain abilities, and the
 priest kits were very popular because they inadvertently were a little 
more powerful than other classes. In the new <b>D&amp;D</b>'s prestige class system, we can always compare the power of a prestige class to the power a character with standard (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/175240000">Player's Handbook</a></i>)
 classes would have at an equivalent character level to see if something
 is out of whack. So, while designing this book for the new <b>D&amp;D</b>
 was a lot more work and a delicate balancing act, at the same time 
we're confident that the result is something fun and still playable.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: In gathering together the incredible number
 of major and minor Faerün deities, which ones stand out in your mind as
 being underdeveloped when you first considered them but who gained much
 from your creative input?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> I had a lot of fun with the halfling 
pantheon, which I saw as homey and lame but which I now think is pretty 
darn interesting. For a god who has had so much influence on the 
setting, I found that Bane had remarkably little development, so he was 
pretty fun to do, too. Lliira, whom I confess I really hated, was 
probably my favorite challenge. (I practically begged Eric and Rich to 
let me take a lot of the gods other people might view as "also rans.") I
 actually wrote up a <i>huge</i> section on Lliira--far more words than 
anyone would ever want, with an associated prestige class and 
everything. Looking at my outline, the goddess of joyous dancing 
probably didn't deserve that much space, so I had to scale back.</p>
<p class="size2">I approached every single deity I wrote from the 
perspective of, "Would I play a cleric of this deity?" If the answer was
 no, I did a fair amount of tinkering.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric:</b> Having worked on the gods of the Realms 
for many years, I find it wise not to pick favorites. That said, I think
 most, if not all, of the gods have evolved in this book to varying 
degrees and in interesting ways. I'm particularly glad to see Erik's 
influence on this book, as he has brought a new perspective to many of 
the deities.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: The chapter on temples is amazing--the 
detail given to the Abbey of the Sword, the Darkhouse of Saerloon, the 
Leaves of Learning, and the Wyvernstones of Hullack is extremely 
impressive. What guidelines determined that level of detail in a product
 that's more sourcebook than adventure book?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> Well, first off, when you get Boyd on a book, you're never going to have a shortness of words or detail!</p>
<p class="size2">Secondly, the temple section gave us a chance to get 
out of the mire of deity statistic blocks. (Believe me, you'll be a lot 
happier we did them for you once you get a look at their girth.) I did 
only one temple, the Darkhouse of Saerloon, which gave me a chance to 
change scale from the divine to the personal. I had a good time writing 
about the family that runs the Darkhouse (a secret temple to Shar built 
on a lighthouse island), about their personal relationships and 
motivations.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric:</b> Erik worked up a "temple template" that 
specified the basic form and we both wrote to that template. Like the 
temples that appeared in <i>Powers and Pantheons</i>, these temples are 
intended to serve as bases for your campaign, to which the PCs can 
return time and time again for knowledge, healing, equipment, or even 
adventure. We deliberately set the temples in the eastern Heartlands, 
where most campaigns begin, and focused them on some of the core gods of
 the setting: Malar, Oghma, Shar, and Tempus.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik: </b>I worked up the basic outline for the 
temple section based on what information I always look for in RPG 
products I plan to use in my game. Hence, there's a section on temple 
relations with other temples in the area, a host of adventure hooks, and
 a detailed section on how to break into the temple. At the end of the 
day, despite the DM's best efforts, some dastardly players are going to 
want to loot these places, so I figured we might as well arm DMs 
appropriately for the challenge!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i> is loaded with impressive prestige classes. Which do you think players will consider the most exceptional ones?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> My favorite is by far the techsmith of 
Gond, which I'm fairly certain will be loved by many and hated by a few.
 In a world teeming with golems, gunpowder, and constructs, it seemed 
ludicrous to me to mire the Wonderbringer and his servants in a sort of 
tinker gnome paradigm, constantly inventing "wondrous" Rube Goldberg 
wood and twine inventions that don't work or that simply aren't that 
cool. (Whee! this sword squirts water!) So, the techsmith embraces 
technology (such as it is) in a way we've never before seen in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game.</p>
<p class="size2">Playtesters got a kick out of the auspician, a servant 
of Tymora or Beshaba who has extraordinary influence over the whims of 
luck, and DMs will love the ocular adept, which gives the old beholder 
cultist from the color illustration in the original <b>Forgotten Realms </b>hardback a whole new shtick.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric:</b> My personal favorites are the 
dweomerkeeper, the horned harbinger, and the wearers of the purple. The 
first class allows followers of Mystra to truly wrap themselves in the 
glory of the Weave, while the other two reflect the lingering influence 
of the Crown of Myrkul, headpiece of the dead god of the dead, and the 
teachings of Sammaster, a fallen Chosen of Mystra. I really like the 
mantle and cloak of mysteries powers evinced by dweomerkeepers, which 
take advantage of the metamagic possibilities of 3rd Edition in a unique
 and interesting way. As a DM, I can't wait to unleash an army of undead
 led by a horned harbinger on overly confident PCs. And the wearers of 
the purple demonstrate how even a godless cult can have truly terrifying
 followers.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean:</b> I'm fond of the arachne for Lolth (you 
can't go wrong with something that really shows of the wickedness and 
weirdness of her worshippers), the doomguide for Kelemvor (death clerics
 that hate undead are a fun quirk), and the waveservant for Umberlee 
(who is just plain weird). Each has some really neat abilities, and (for
 the arachne and waveservant) they're not someone you'd want to see 
across a battle line.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: So, what didn't make the grade? In other words, what materials did you decide to forgo in this particular book?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean:</b> The book ran long, but we ended up increasing the number of pages in the book (partially because the sales of the <i><b>Forgotten Realms </b>Campaign Setting </i>convinced
 our business guys that folks would be willing to buy a bigger book if 
they thought it was worth the money, and this one is still jam-packed 
even after the page bump), so nothing really needed to be cut. We had to
 drop a prestige class that wasn't working out the way we wanted and 
adjust a temple site that relied on that prestige class, but overall the
 end result is just about everything the designers wrote.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> The really long Lliira write-up I've 
already mentioned was a sad loss. In the early stages of the project, I 
started tinkering with what I was calling the scions of Karsus, 
whacked-out folks who wanted to track down copies of the Nether Scrolls 
and make themselves gods à la their hero, Karsus. I might come back to 
that idea, eventually, but I never was able to make it gel.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric:</b> We couldn't provide the level of detail to
 the more minor gods that the major gods received. However, gamers will 
find plenty of good information on these less-well-known deities, far 
beyond what appears in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms </b>Campaign Setting</i>.
 The only reason for this is space: The book will be quite long as it is
 and there simply wasn't room to cover every deity in exhaustive detail.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What are you personal favorite contributions to the book?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric: </b>I find prestige classes to be one of the most interesting aspects of the new <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, so I really enjoyed working on that section. However, my favorite
 section is probably the temples, as those settings really came to life 
in this book.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik: </b>I slipped in a few things for careful 
readers with good vocabularies. I tried to give a lot of my gods 
"subtexts"--little stories going on beneath the surface. I think my 
favorite contribution to the book has to do with Oghma and Denier, and 
was brought to us by one of my favorite Realms gods of all time, the 
late, much-lamented Leira. The lady of lies has one more trick up her 
dead sleeve, and it might just prove to be a doozy.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean:</b> I tweaked the ocular adept (beholder cult 
prestige class), the techsmith (Gondar prestige class), and the 
waveservant to implement some cool rules features appropriate for the 
theme of those classes, and I'm particularly happy with how they turned 
out.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What are each of you working on next?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Eric:</b> Write-ups of the human ethnic groups and dwarven subraces for a future <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 sourcebook that should be very popular with players and DMs alike. I'm 
particularly excited about the humans chapter, as this will be the first
 time that the human ethnic groups of the Realms are explored.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean:</b> I'm finishing up a secret project with <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=/leaving.asp?url=http://www.montecook.com/&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20020510a">Monte Cook</a>. After this, I start work on a <b>Forgotten Realms</b> regional sourcebook, then go on to develop the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> races book (of which I wrote a part a couple months ago). After that . . . I can't say.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Erik:</b> After a nasty year of freelancing with <i>Faiths and Pantheons</i> for Wizards of the Coast and writing parts of <i>Legions of Hell</i>, <i>Jade Dragons &amp; Hungry Ghosts</i>, and all of <i>Armies of the Abyss</i> for Green Ronin's d20 line, all on top of my normal job of editing <i>Polyhedron</i> and the Living Greyhawk Journal section of <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20020510a">Dragon</a></i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20020510a"> Magazine</a>,
 I'm tired. I'm going to sleep for about six months. If anyone wants me 
to do freelance work for them after that, they're welcome to call me.</p>
