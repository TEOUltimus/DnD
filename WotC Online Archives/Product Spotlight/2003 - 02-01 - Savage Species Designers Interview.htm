<p class="size2">In this month's exclusive interview, the designers of the new <b>D&amp;D</b> supplement <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881580000">Savage Species</a></i> discuss monsters as PCs, monsters as NPCs, and monsters as prestige classes. Oh -- did we mention monsters? </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards of the Coast: How did this project 
originate? Has there been a demand for rules governing monsters as 
player characters or developing them more fully as nonplayer characters?
 </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>David Eckelberry:</b> Roleplaying Games R&amp;D 
requested that all of us come up with some good ideas for projects in 
2003 -- sort of an open call. This [project suggestion] was Jennifer's, 
and, I think, the best. Better than my wacky submissions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer Clarke Wilkes: </b>I proposed the project 
in 2000, after a closing seminar at Gen Con in which a number of players
 suggested a supplement book about playing monsters as characters. The 
project was approved in early 2001, and we got started writing in the 
fall of 2001. The book began as a guide to playing monsters as PCs but 
morphed into a generally more useful book to assist DMs in creating 
interesting monster NPCs as well. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Give us an overview of the book. How do 
monsters' levels, hit points, and other statistics vary when they go 
from being creatures out of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11552">Monster Manual</a></i></b><b> to being PCs and NPCs?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich Redman:</b> Wow, you're asking us to repeat a serious chunk of the book here. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> Basically, <i>Savage Species</i> allows players a few options when they step up to play a monster. They can take the monster straight from our <i>Monster Manual,</i>
 adapting it a little with the rules we present. Or they can use the 
monster's base ability scores as a sort of racial adjustment, and make 
up their own character based on that monster. Finally, I presented a 
more radical third option where you get to "level up" in a monster class
 until you become the full-power monster as it exists in the <i>Monster Manual</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich: </b>Monsters don't have levels, they have Hit 
Dice. They keep those and add levels onto them. They keep the same 
number of skill points, regardless of Intelligence. Monster hit points 
change in that they get the maximum number for their first Hit Die and 
then roll the rest of their dice.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer</b>: Toward the end of the process, the revision to the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 core books required us to take another look at monster skills and 
advancement in general. This added more time but ultimately made things 
simpler and more logical, I think.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: How do 1-Hit Die creatures work? Or creatures with breath weapons?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> 1HD creatures can be copied out of the <i>Monster Manual</i>,
 or they can be rebuilt from the ground up, much like the standard 
races. I think you're asking about changes in monster abilities in 
general due to Hit Dice gained through levels. Class levels have no 
effect on monster abilities. Breath weapons are no different than any 
other monster ability: They cause the monster to gain level adjustments.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave: </b>Just like elves and dwarves, 1HD monsters 
take up a class level instead of a monster Hit Die, though they preserve
 their monster "racial" abilities. Of course, some 1HD monsters (pixies,
 etc) may still require a level adjustment because of their power level 
compared to standard races.. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What difficulties did you encounter in designing the parameters for monsters as characters?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> Obviously, we're playing with fire here. <i>Savage Species</i>
 is quite clearly an optional ruleset, and players should of course ask 
their Dungeon Master if it's cool that they're playing an ogre magi 
before showing up on game night. That said, our players expect and we 
are obligated to give a well-balanced system in which monsters are fun, 
cool to play, and at the same time, won't break existing campaigns into 
pieces. So, when working on monster rules, feats, and monster classes, 
it's always a balancing act to keep monsters playable and interesting, 
and not so dominant in the game that humans and half-orcs look pale in 
comparison. Part of that balancing act is in assigning level adjustments
 to determine ECLs for monsters. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Level adjustments were the toughest part. 
We spent hours and hours discussing and reviewing the level adjustments.
 The more abilities a monster has, the harder it is to evaluate.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Which monsters were the toughest to translate?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer:</b> We definitely had to decide early on 
whether to worry about creatures that would not normally be playable, 
due to no Intelligence, lack of grasping limbs, or the like. Should we 
bother giving advancement for animals, on the off chance that someone 
would want to make an<i> awakened</i> wildcat druid? Should we have 
spells that allow the awakening of inanimate objects? Is it possible to 
play an aware, intelligent skeleton? (And do we want to encourage that?)</p>
<p class="size2">Ultimately, it came down to several classes of 
creatures. The simplest can be played with little effort, simply 
adjusting the effective character level. More complicated creatures 
required detailed rules for advancing. The most outlandish come with 
lots of warnings!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave: </b>The toughest monsters are those that allow players to really break the model for <b>D&amp;D</b>
 adventuring. Incorporeal creatures are an example of this. Unless your 
dungeons are all coated with some ethereal protection (see the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881660000">Stronghold Builder's Guide</a></i>),
 incorporeal PCs will break the dungeon-delving model pretty quickly. 
Other undead can be equally troublesome, given their ability to drain 
levels and create monstrous spawn.</p>
<p class="size2">
</p><p class="size2">One way we deal with the problematic creatures is 
in costing. Some abilities aren't by definition the most powerful, but 
they shape or distort the adventuring model in ways we don't want. So 
those creatures receive a higher level adjustment than the 
easier-to-adapt trolls, giants, awakened animals, etc.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What was the playtesting for this guide like? Were there hordes of wild and exotic PCs in every session? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer:</b> I was not present for the playtesting 
sessions, to my sadness, but I did hear about a very amusing rat 
sorcerer/rogue riding on the back of its cat familiar. Oh -- and the 
buffalo.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> The first [step] was lots and lots of 
comparison and eyeballing. I grabbed the opinion of lots of my fellow 
developers in the office and friends I play with at home. We compared 
one monster to another and to more typical characters, such as half-orc 
barbarians and elf wizards. At home, we played a lot of mock "arena" 
combats between would-be player characters. (No, I don't think that's 
the only way you can test character power levels, since most campaigns 
don't involve the heroes fighting one another; but among melee-type 
characters it provided good data for comparisons of round-by-round 
attacks, damage, and tactics.) I detoured my normal play group out of <i>Temple of Elemental Evil</i>
 in order to do some playtesting. In the end, my play group has become a
 bit weirder for it: We have a half-giant, a werewolf, a goblin, and a 
half-fiend.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Which monsters didn't make the cut because they simply wouldn't work? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich: </b>Monsters with no way to manipulate humanoid equipment, monsters lacking human senses, the undead.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> Non-intelligent stuff. Constructs made the
 final cut, as we wanted to allow people to play Frankenstein's monster.
 We have some tricks, like the <i>awaken</i> spell, to let you do more 
with creatures that are less obvious. In addition, some monsters (e.g., 
the tarrasque) don't make the cut really because they fall outside the 
boundaries of the 1st- to 20th-level game. In epic games, perhaps you 
can play a solar or balor. But not when your friends are merely 20th 
level or less.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What are some of the more interesting feats that monsters now have? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer:</b> I wrote a number of feats for 
adjusting breath weapons and sonic attacks, as well as feats to overcome
 innate weaknesses. Others in the department made some interesting 
suggestions; the one that comes quickest to mind is Rich Baker's "Big 
Hairy Ass of Doom" feat, originally conceived for giants. Its name is 
more "PC" now, but the effect is still there: Throw yourself onto a 
space to crush smaller creatures within.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> Ability Focus, Quicken Spell-like Ability, and the Cumbrous series of feats. What are those? Wait and see.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: There are quite a few intriguing new magic 
weapons, wondrous items, spells, and prestige classes available to the 
new monster classes. What are your favorites? (Something about the name 
"Illithid Savant" cracks me up, by the way.) </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer: </b>Why, thank yuh verry much. I designed 
the Illithid Savant, although it did require some adjusting by the 
talented developer. I am quite proud of the prestige class formerly 
known as "Lord of the Flies" (which I believe is now called the 
Swarmlord). I also created the Sybil, which turned out to be a real pain
 when I had to come up with examples of the various levels of riddle 
difficulty.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> Don't mock the Illithid Savant. He will 
not just eat your brains, but cook them too. I didn't work much on the 
prestige classes, but the spells I'm proud of are the Resistance line of
 spells and Lion's Charge, to name a few.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> I thought Dave's Survivor was a cool prestige class, because it really helped monsters cover some of their weaknesses. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Can you outline the idea behind the new monster templates?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich: </b>We looked at the monsters and said 
"Wouldn't it be cool if . . ." I built the winged, insectile, and 
reptilian templates because I thought they were cool additions to 
monsters.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave: </b>What he said. Plus a lot more exotic stuff.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer: </b>In my case, I was looking for ways to 
create the kinds of hybrids you'd expect to see in fantasy. The most 
obvious one is the anthropomorphic animal, for all the furry fans. I 
came up with a centauroid template too, for the half-human/half-beast 
things (my sample creature was an Ursula-type half-octopus), but as it 
turned out, the tauric template in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882680000">Monster Manual II</a></i>
 was being developed at the same time. Since they were practically 
identical, the tauric was published. The weirdest template (and the 
trickiest to come up with) is the symbiont, but I really wanted a way to
 combine pretty well anything. Plus I love the name "bugsucker."</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Given all these parameters and options, what's the wildest creature someone might consider developing as a PC?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> You're kidding, right? Our players have incredible imaginations. I wouldn't put anything past them. </p> v<b>Dave:</b> An incarnated stone golem emancipated wight?<p></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer:</b> Oh, my. I don't think I can answer that. How about a gelatinous half-fiend hydra? No, I'm sure it could get much weirder.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What long-term insights into gaming do you hope players and DMs will take from <i>Savage Species</i>? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dave:</b> Well, a few things. First, building 
monsters as characters should give players a better understanding of the
 some of the basic "building blocks" of how it all comes together in the
 system. Watching how we do our best to balance power concerns and 
assign level adjustments may give them a better sense of what it means 
to be a developer-as-DM, as they choose what new elements -- be they 
monster characters, NPCs, or whatever -- to incorporate into their own 
campaigns. Finally, they should get a good insight into how some of the 
developers at Wizards think of things in <b>D&amp;D</b>, and hints at what's to come.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jennifer:</b> I hope that people will have fun 
experimenting with goofy new creatures, but that they will also realize 
the amount of work needed to make a viable, balanced monster character. 
This should also be a great tool for DMs to create unique and 
challenging beings for the characters to interact with.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> I hope people come away with new insights 
into the differences between monsters and characters that will help them
 design both better characters and better monsters for their own games. </p>
