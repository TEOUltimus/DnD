 explores a number of new item types. The first three entries in this 
series discussed a few of the new types -- augment crystals, runestaffs,
 and magic item sets -- and provided examples and discussion of sample 
items from the compendium. The last installment will discuss how some of
 the items in the book can be used in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> campaign setting. Of course, these items can just as easily be placed in the <b>Eberron</b> as well; we simply chose <b>Forgotten Realms</b> as one example of how to better introduce these items in the context of a campaign setting.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The easiest method of introduction may be to link new 
magic item types to ancient or lost magical traditions and empires. 
These include fallen Ammarindar, Netheril, Narfell, Imaskar, the Shoon 
Imperium, and the ancient elven kingdoms. Numerous other ancient empires
 kept hidden magics, most of which have been lost to the residents of 
current day Faerun. They might be unearthed by tomb raiders scouring the
 graves of ancient Illefarn, rediscovered by Halruaan elders researching
 recovered Netherese libraries, or collected from an unsealed network of
 Imaskari tunnels. Regardless of the source, ancient magics are 
constantly being revealed and recovered by intrepid adventurers and 
greedy grave robbers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Provided below are a few examples you might use:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Augment Crystals </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Nearly two thousand years ago, dwarven wizards studying 
at Xothol--the school of magic in Ammarindar--developed a new form of 
magical crystals to empower dwarven weapons and armor. They believed 
these would be vital in bolstering Ammarindar's armies against possible 
Netherese incursions. These crystals were meant to give the forces extra
 magic in their weapons and armors to thwart and circumvent Netherese 
assaults, but they never came into use. After the fall of Netheril, King
 Tormalk ordered the school magically sequestered until a time when it 
was needed. Before it was closed, however, one of the dwarven wizards, a
 greedy student known as Abathron Silvermelder, secreted some of the 
stones for further study. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Recently, some of Xothol's augment crystals have been 
rediscovered in the ruins of the dwarven city of Ascore. It seems 
unlikely that Abathron transported them there, given the disparity in 
time between the closing of Xothol and the fall of Netheril. A Shadovar 
expedition from the City of Shade discovered a cache of one hundred 
stones during an expedition to study the pyramids of Ascore. They had to
 trade more than a few when their party was surrounded by an 
overpowering Zhent caravan. Since then, the crystals have been dispersed
 across Faerun. When attending a nobel revel, for instance, visiting 
Halruaans made note of one of the crystals in the hilt of Alroy 
Adarbrent's blade. Two more of the crystals have made their way into the
 hoard of Amilektrevitrioelis, a mature adult blue dragon hoarder DrF. 
It is believed that "Amilek" may still have access to portals to 
Anauroch, and may have "acquired" the gems from the Shadovar during one 
of his forays into the desert.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Crystal of Mind Cloaking<br></b><b>Price (Item Level): </b> 500 gp (3rd) (least), 4,000 gp (8th) (lesser), or 10,000 gp (12th) (greater)<br><b>Body Slot: </b> -- (armor crystal)<br><b>Caster Level: </b> 5th<br><b>Aura: </b> Faint; (DC 17) abjuration<br><b>Activation: </b> --; see text<br><b>Weight: </b> --</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>This crystal is black as a clouded night sky.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A <i>crystal of mind cloaking</i> protects you against mental infiltration.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Least: </b> This augment crystal grants you a +1 competence bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lesser: </b> As above, except the crystal grants a +3 competence bonus. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greater: </b> As above, except the crystal grants a 
+5 competence bonus. In addition, if you fail a save against a 
mind-affecting spell or ability, you can choose to reroll the save as an
 immediate (mental) action. This ability functions once per day. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>resistance.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Cost to Create:</i> 250 gp, 20 XP, 1 day (least); 2,000 gp, 160 XP, 4 days (lesser); 5,000 gp, 400 XP, 10 days (greater).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Crystals of mind cloaking </i>were one of many armor 
crystals designed to protect dwarven forces from Netherese spells. Of 
the greatest fears of the dwarves, a tight knit and brotherly people, 
are spells that turn one against another. These crystals help to prevent
 an enemy caster from taking control or befuddling the mind of their 
wearers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Runestaffs</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Deep Imaskar was founded by Ilphemon, a powerful 
wizard-lord of the Imaskari civilization. During that time, the wizard 
and his heirs created a number of powerful runestaffs to bolster their 
defenses against usurpation and betrayal. In the end, the staffs were 
not enough to defend Ilphemon's heirs against a coup by a cabal of 
necromancers. After Chaschara freed the city from tyranny, declaring 
herself Lady Protector of the Realm, it is believed that the staffs were
 lost--a casualty of the cabal's tyranny. Unbeknownst to the Imaskari, 
the staffs were secretly hidden in the treasure of family Shalphor, a 
greedy merchant family that secretly backed the coup.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Recently, The Great Seal, an enormous magical barrier 
blocking entrance into and out of Deep Imaskar, was broken, allowing a 
small number of Imaskari to sever ties to their homeland forever. One of
 the Imaskari who left was Gandar Shalphor, a merchant and sorcerer of 
middling power and incredible greed. Shalphor took his family's 
valuables in extradimensional storage devices, intent on selling the 
ancient magics to the outside world for exorbitant prices. He has since 
sold a large cache of the staffs to a caravan of elven settlers 
traveling to Cormanthor, as well as to a chartered Cormyrean adventuring
 group known as the Staves of Immersea.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Runestaff of Time<br></b><b>Price (Item Level): </b> 35,000 gp (16th)<br><b>Body Slot: </b> -- (held)<br><b>Caster Level: </b> 17th<br><b>Aura: </b> Strong; (DC 23) transmutation<br><b>Activation: </b> As spell used<br><b>Weight: </b> 3 lb.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>When you look at this staff, it becomes hard for your eyes to focus, as if the item is constantly blurring and shifting.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A <i>runestaff of time</i> allows you to cast any of the
 following spells (each once per day) by expending a prepared arcane 
spell or arcane spell slot of the same level or higher.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>expeditious retreat</i></li>
<li><i> haste</i></li>
<li><i> temporal stasis</i></li>
<li><i> time stop </i></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Staff, <i>expeditious retreat, haste, temporal stasis, time stop.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Cost to Create:</i> 17,500 gp, 1,400 XP, 35 days.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Under the guidance of wizard-lord Ilphemon, Deep Imaskari wizards created the <i>runestaffs of time.</i>
 They used these items to maintain a ready set of time-related spells 
for use in their experiments to halt the aging process. Part of the 
longevity of the race is probably due to their comprehensive use of 
these items.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the beginning of his travels, Gandar Shalphor came across a band of moon elves on their way to Cormanthor. He sold a <i>runestaff of time </i>to
 the leader of the band, an adventurer by the name of Elrithian 
Taelethendri (CG male moon elf cleric 13 [Labelas Enoreth]). Elrithian 
hopes to use the staffs in his efforts to unravel a time stasis field 
surrounding the hidden resting place of the Arcstaff of Khavoerm, an 
ancient artifact of great power. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Miscellaneous Items</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition to runestaffs, augment crystals, and set items (as described in the previous installment in this series), the <i>Magic Item Compendium</i>
 also has a number of other items. These include items for most of the 
standard and non-standard 20-level classes, as well as for characters 
that use psionics, incarnum, <i>Tome of Magic</i> material, and other sourcebooks. Following are a few items more from the <i>Magic Item Compendium</i> with brief discussions of how they might be included in a <b>Forgotten Realms</b> campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aberrant </b><b>Sphere<br></b><b>Price (Item Level): </b> 2,800 gp (7th)<br><b>Body Slot: </b> -- (held)<br><b>Caster Level: </b> 7th<br><b>Aura: </b> Moderate; (DC 18) conjuration<br><b>Activation: </b> Full-round (command)<br><b>Weight: </b> 1 lb.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The surface of this sphere seems to constantly flash with words in your native tongue, but you can't make out what they say.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Created by alienists (<i>Complete Arcane</i>, pg. 21) and other cultists who worship aberrant entities, an <i>aberrant sphere</i>
 allows its wielder to summon creatures from beyond space and time at 
the cost of a fraction of his own sanity. A sphere has 3 charges, which 
are renewed each day at dawn. Spending 1 or more charges causes the 
sphere to shatter, as it summons a particular kind of aberration, which 
appears anywhere within 30 feet of you and serves you (<i>as summon monster I</i>) for 7 rounds. You also take a penalty on your Will saves as long as the creature is present. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>1 charge:</i> Summons a choker; -1 penalty on Will saves.<br><i>2 charges:</i> Summons a grick; -2 penalty on Will saves.<br><i>3 charges:</i> Summons a carrion crawler; -3 penalty on Will saves. </p>
<p align="LEFT">At the end of the duration (or when the creature is 
destroyed), the sphere reforms in your hand (or at your feet if your 
hands are full) and the penalty on your Will saves disappears. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>summon monster IV.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Cost to Create:</i> 1,400 gp, 112 XP</p>
<p align="LEFT">The <i>aberrant sphere</i> is one of the more minor of 
the many items and artifacts attributed to Zceryll, "the star-spawn," a 
strange extra-planar entity believed to communicate with alienists. At 
least two powerful scepters, one in the Well of Dragons and one buried 
under Unthalass, are also attributed to Zceryll; these items are 
believed to have had a significant effect on the Tiamatan agents 
searching for them and to have transformed the red dragon Arsekaslyx 
into a strange alien form of dragon. Most items related to the entity 
have one thing in common: wielders hear or see alien words, whispered or
 uttered by unseen beings--perhaps by Zceryll itself. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ch</b><b>ime of Harmonic Agony<br></b><b>Price (Item Level): </b> 3,100 gp (8th)<br><b>Body Slot: </b> -- (held)<br><b>Caster Level: </b> 7th<br><b>Aura: </b> Moderate; (DC 18) evocation<br><b>Activation: </b> Standard (command)<br><b>Weight: </b> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>This constantly vibrating silver chime is inscribed with bizarre, alien musical notes.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A <i>chime of harmonic agony</i> allows you to channel 
musical power through your own body to wreak harm on your enemies. When 
you activate the chime, you must spend one daily use of your bardic 
music ability and target a creature within 30 feet. The chime deals 
sonic damage equal to 3d6 + your Charisma modifier (Fort DC 16 half). </p>
<p align="LEFT">If you also wear a magic item that grants an enhancement
 bonus to your Constitution score, you can add the item's bonus to the 
damage dealt by the chime. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A chime of harmonic agony functions three times per day. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>shout.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Cost to Create</i>: 1,550 gp, 124 XP, 4 days.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The <i>chime or harmonic agony </i>is a tool seemingly 
better suited for the Maiden of Pain's clergy than that of the Lady of 
Joy, but during the Time of Troubles nearly everything was turned on its
 head. When agents of Loviatar murdered Selgaunt's High Revelmistress 
Chlanna Asjros (a mortal lover of the Lady of Joy during this brief 
period), Llira became enraged. A group of militant Llirans known as "the
 Scarlet Mummers" now tours Faerun with their Lady's support, destroying
 agents of Loviatar in elaborate dances of pain. They frequently employ <i>chimes of harmonic agony </i>in a show of defiant irony, teaching the followers of Loviatar that true pain comes from the loss of love, not from a scourge.</p>
