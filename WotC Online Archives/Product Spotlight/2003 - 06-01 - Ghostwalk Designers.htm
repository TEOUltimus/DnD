 campaign setting explain where PCs go to die, the intricacies of life 
after death, and what to expect if your destiny is a city called 
Manifest.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Given that the <i>Ghostwalk</i>
 campaign setting presents the world of spirits who have left behind the
 land of the living for the actual physical locale that is the land of 
the dead, what motivates characters not to get themselves killed in 
order to get there?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean Reynolds:</b> In <i>Ghostwalk</i>,
 the focal point of the campaign is a place in the living world that is 
very close to the land of the dead. In this border area, the living and 
ghosts can interact as if both were on their home turf. So characters 
don't have to die to get there, they can just walk!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 Where did the idea come from, to make it possible to play a dead PC as a
 ghost? Did it spring from a PC death somewhere in your respective 
gaming pasts?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 I think it was just a matter of Monte and me understanding that one of 
the least fun parts of the game is when a character dies. Not only is 
there a feeling of loss regarding the character, but also the player 
doesn't have anything to do until a new character can be brought in. We 
thought a campaign where a character's death wouldn't be the end of play
 for that character or player would be a neat twist on standard <b>D&amp;D</b>. The short concept we presented to Bill Slavicsek (head of RPGs) and Keith Strohm (<b>D&amp;D</b>
 brand manager at the time) had a one-sentence summary for the book: "If
 your character dies, you can continue playing immediately as the ghost 
of your PC."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: The city of Manifest, the central locale for the <i>Ghostwalk</i>
 campaign setting, is quite elaborate, with numerous rules governing 
those who live there . . . and those who don't (to be literal about it).
 How did you settle on a city as the way station between the worlds?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Monte Cook:</b>
 The idea to have it be a city came quite naturally. The setting 
postulates that it's valuable for a spirit in the land of the dead to 
have its body brought to it. All these people, then, come to the area 
bearing the corpses of their fallen comrades and departed loved ones. 
Thus, a whole city grew up around their eventually destination. The 
Guild of Morticians takes care of the bodies once they arrive in the 
city, storing the bodies in the Tombyards until they are ready to be 
taken down to the veil between life and death -- a journey called the 
Ghostwalk.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 How difficult was it to outline Manifest's history, the gods who are 
worshipped there, and the various peoples who live there?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Monte:</b>
 The gods worshipped in Manifest are, not surprisingly, death gods. One,
 Dracanish, is a god who represents the Final End. His worshippers don't
 care too much for the idea, then, of ghosts running around the city 
when they should just accept their inevitable end. The other main god, 
Aluvan, is a protector of the dead, the Warder of Death's Children. 
There are other gods as well, and even a rather infamous demon lord of 
the undead.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">When
 creating the neighboring countries, I wanted an interesting mix of 
different cultures that would emphasize the different character classes 
in <b>D&amp;D</b>. Tereppek, for example, is a scholarly Ottoman-style 
country that favors wizardry, while Bazareene is ruled by sorcerer 
queens who are watched over by noble monk bodyguards. Salkiria is a 
civilized country whose fighters prefer weapons like rapiers, while the 
nomads of Thurkasia prefer greatswords, and some of them study berserk 
fighting. With Manifest such a cosmopolitan place, I wanted to make sure
 that the human cultures were distinct enough to keep the place from 
feeling like a generic<b> D&amp;D</b> large city.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: There are a number of new and engaging prestige classes that relate to the ghosts of <i>Ghostwalk</i>.
 The eidolon class seems to encompass the most basic type of ghost, 
while a class like the dwarven deathwarden chanter seems quite focused. 
What are your personal favorites among the new prestige classes?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 Well, technically the eidolon isn't a prestige class; it's a special 
base class only available to ghosts. If you want to expand your ghost 
powers in a particular path (such as possessing creatures, frightening 
people, or disrupting flesh), you level up in eidolon.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As
 for the actual prestige classes, it's a hard choice. The Arboreal 
Guardian lets you get some neat forest-related powers, the bone 
collector is cool because he empowers himself with the remains of undead
 creatures, and the deathwarden chanter emphasizes the singing and 
runecarving aspects of dwarves. One of the advantages of actually having
 a setting included with the book is it lets us create prestige classes 
with ties to the setting's flavor, rather than just basing them on game 
mechanics or generic archetypes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: Any favorites among the numerous new spells and magic items available to players in the <i>Ghostwalk</i> setting? If nothing else, <i>wall of ectoplasm</i> sounds like a cool spell, and the wondrous item <i>Flesh of Orcus</i> has my attention.</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b> I tried to come up with some cool spells with evocative names, such as <i>bottomless hate</i> and <i>I smell your fear</i>. <i>Glyph of turning</i> is pretty sweet, too.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As
 for magic items, anything with Orcus's name is going to get people's 
attention. In the early stages of concepting, Monte and I were trying to
 think up a new deity of undeath, and we realized that Orcus worked best
 because he's so recognizable. One other thing I'm glad is in this book 
is the concept of named magic weapons -- magic weapons have to be given a
 name when they're crafted or the magic doesn't hold. It makes the world
 more alive if that +1 sword is actually called <i>Faldrin's Last Hope.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: The <i>Ghostwalk</i>
 setting lends itself to all sorts of campaigns, as you mention in the 
book--dungeon crawls, political campaigns, the "melting pot" city 
campaign. You even describe it as a campaign "rife with opportunities to
 examine the philosophical, historical, theological, and metaphysical 
aspects of your game world." Do you see the city of Manifest and the 
campaign setting in general as a cut above the hack-and-slash campaign 
idea?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Monte:</b>
 It's true that the very nature of Ghostwalk begs questions to be asked 
-- ones that many gamers may not have thought to ask about their 
campaign worlds already. What exactly happens to a person when they die?
 What does it really mean to be undead? What are the implications of 
being brought back from the dead? How aware are the spirits of the 
departed of the activities of the living? What motivates spirits once 
they are dead?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">That
 said, I see the setting as offering all types of adventures. If you 
don't care about such philosophical questions, you'll still find <i>Ghostwalk</i>
 to have plenty of opportunities to explore ancient underground sites 
(the city has two undercity levels in addition to the Ghostwalk itself, 
which leads directly to the Land of the Dead), fight against deadly 
enemies, and learn cool new spells, feats and other things.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: Were your playtests for this setting more of a thinking player's campaign than usual?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 I ran a playtest campaign for some of the included adventures, and my 
players definitely spent a lot of time exploring the setting and their 
own roles in the campaign. It actually took them longer than I expected 
to complete the adventures because they wanted to talk over and analyze 
the information they discovered. Monte runs a complex game and he put a 
lot of work into the factional aspect of the Ghostwalk campaign.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 How might you recommend a group of players new to this setting begin 
adventuring? Where should they go, what should they do, what questions 
should they be asking themselves about this new setting?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Monte:</b>
 The best way to get started is to figure out how to get there -- that 
probably means accompanying a caravan of the dead to the city. Manifest 
is pretty different from a standard fantasy city, what with all the 
ghosts around, and the different sort of rules for how one can expect 
ghosts to act or what you might expect them to be able to do. Play it 
safe, and get to know what's what and who's who before you go jumping 
into anything.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 strangest thing of all, however, is that in Manifest, death isn't 
necessarily something to be feared. There, being dead is just another 
state of being -- one with the occasionally useful advantages. For some 
missions, PCs might find it better to be dead than alive!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What's next for the campaign setting of <i>Ghostwalk</i>? Anything planned?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 As far as I know, Wizards intends this to be a one-shot. There is a web
 enhancement for it on the way, and I'll continue to update material for
 the setting on <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.seankreynolds.com&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20030601a">my website</a>, but unless they've changed their plans in the past year, there will be no official support products for <i>Ghostwalk</i>.
 Of course, if it sells a zillion copies and people demand more, there's
 always the chance that Wizards will make follow-up products.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 Finally, what's next for you? Will having designed something as 
philosophical and metaphysical as this new setting impact your next 
designs?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Monte:</b> Since leaving Wizards, I've started my own d20 company, Malhavoc Press. My next big project is a book for Malhavoc called <i>Arcana Unearthed</i>. This is an Open Gaming License product, and there's really no better way to describe it than an alternate <i>Player's Handbook</i>. What I mean by that, is that <i>Arcana Unearthed</i> is a complete <i>Player's Handbook</i>,
 using the basics of the rules that people are already familiar with, 
but all the "pieces" are different -- the races, classes, feats, spells,
 and so on. It's for people either interested in a completely different 
take on fantasy but desiring to stick with the basic rules that they're 
already familiar with, or for those looking for balanced and compatible 
material for their existing game. <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.montecook.com&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20030601a">My website</a> will tell you more.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b> The book I just finished for Malhavoc Press is <i>Anger of Angels</i>, about angels and demons and the war between Heaven and Hell. There's a bit about ideology in that book and <i>Ghostwalk</i>
 colored some aspects of it. For my day job, I'm a computer RPG designer
 for Black Isle Studios, and the game we're working on right now has 
many elements about guilt, relationships, past loves, and restless 
spirits, so the work on <i>Ghostwalk</i> has been a help with that, too.</span></p>
