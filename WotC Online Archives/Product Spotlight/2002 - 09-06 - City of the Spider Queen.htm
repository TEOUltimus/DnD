 In this month's exclusive interview, designer James Wyatt and 
developer/creative director Rich Baker discuss adventuring in the 
Underdark, dealing with terrifying drow villains, and the benefits of 
owning numerous <i>scrolls of resurrection. . . .</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards of the Coast: The scope of this adventure --
 civil war in the Underdark and a quest to stop a drow priestess from 
raising an enormous undead army to invade the surface world -- is 
breathtaking and epic. How difficult was it to take a story concept 
developed in novels and introduce it to the adventure format? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James Wyatt:</b> One of the things we definitely did
 right was making sure that the adventure connected to the novels but 
did not in any way try to parallel the events of the novels. It's set in
 a different geographical region, and really its only connection is that
 it and the novels are sparked by the same event. So in that sense, it 
was easy -- as easy as it could ever be to plot out an adventure of this
 size, that is. It took a lot of hashing out, for sure. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich Baker:</b> James and I were present in the 
original planning sessions with Bob Salvatore, Richard Byers, Thomas 
Reid, and Phil Athans as the whole <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frnovel/178790000">War of the Spider Queen</a></i>
 plan was hammered out, so the game guys and book guys were able to put 
together a common plot that everyone was happy with. That said, we hit 
an early snag when we realized that the adventure's original setting 
would give away the plot of the second book in the <i>War of the Spider Queen</i> series, but James came up with an alternate location for the adventure that worked even better than the original site. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Does the wealth of previously published 
material about the drow help or hinder the creation of an adventure like
 this one? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Frankly, both. Too much established 
information can get in the way of one's creativity, but on the other 
hand it makes it easier to construct new things upon the established 
foundation. I chose to avoid most of the downside by exploring some 
previously uncharted territory, both geographically and theologically. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> I'd like to add that James did a great job in converting and updating some of the great ideas from 2nd Edition products such as<i> Drow of the Underdark</i>. You'll see some old favorites like the <i>death lance</i> or the spiderstone golem in the adventure, redone for 3rd Edition. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Based on the timeline you offer in the 
introduction, you seem to anticipate the adventure might take as much as
 two months' game time to play out. What challenges does an adventure 
covering that much time present? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> The biggest one is the problems involved 
in allowing characters a chance to spend their ill-gotten gains. Beyond 
that, you need to allow for events to progress beyond the immediate 
surroundings of the PCs, which is what that timeline is there for. It's 
possible that if characters take too much time getting to the conclusion
 of the adventure, things could go very badly for the world at large. 
And it's important for the players to realize that -- so they know that 
what they're doing is important.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Irae T'sarran is quite a detailed villain, 
and she seems extremely intimidating. In designing and developing NPCs, 
how do you determine that fine line between providing enough detail and 
providing too much so that a DM can't develop the character him- or 
herself? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> It's always the DM who breathes life into
 the characters in an adventure. I think it's my job to try to evoke the
 kinds of feelings I want associated with the villain --primarily 
loathing, I guess -- so the players will hate her by the end and the DM 
will have a good feel for how to run her.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Irae grew into such a cool villain that we
 started looking for ways to get even more mileage out of her. Todd 
Lockwood's partially responsible for that, as he created a wonderful 
cover painting of Irae that just knocked our socks off. The trick is to 
give the villain an opportunity to make her presence felt before the 
heroes have a chance to confront her, without creating artificial 
barriers that block the heroes from acting in order to rub their noses 
in the fact that it's too early in the story for them to mix it up with 
her. We've got a few nice surprises waiting in that department.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: A healthy number of subplots make this 
adventure feel even more like an epic novel. There also seem to be 
numerous opportunities for additional adventures to follow. Without 
giving away too much about the overall adventure, what are the most 
exciting subplots/follow-up adventures? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> I'm tremendously excited to finish 
running this adventure so that we can take these 18th-level characters 
and advance them to epic levels pretty soon. I haven't exactly figured 
out yet where I'm going to take them. Part of me wants to get them out 
of the Underdark for a while, just for a change of pace, but to such a 
large extent they've built their characters to be Underdark explorers 
that we may just stay down in the depths. There are higher-up drow 
villains I want them to meet, and I think it would be really 
interesting, someday, to have them face the drow demigoddess who's 
behind all this. As epic and breathtaking as this adventure is, boy, 
it's really just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Kurgoth Hellspawn is a very cool villain, 
and it's possible for the heroes to inadvertently help him in his own 
path to power by taking on Irae. Where did he come from, and what 
happens if the heroes don't deal with him? That's a great follow-up to <i>City of the Spider Queen</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: With something this elaborate, what's the 
playtest process like? Do you run the adventure beginning to end, or do 
you break it up into smaller pieces?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Both. In-house playtest groups ran small 
sections of the adventure over the course of several months. At the same
 time, several RPGA playtest groups ran the adventure. Closer to home, 
we had two DMs -- myself and David Noonan -- running the adventure for 
our regular gaming groups. It's been a little strange, since my regular 
gaming group includes both Dave and Rich Baker, who both had a lot of 
inside knowledge of the adventure! They were great at separating their 
player knowledge from character knowledge, though, and we've all had a 
lot of fun. Of course, we're just finishing it up now, after seven 
months of play! </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: For the would-be designer . . . how long 
does it take to complete an adventure this grand, from concept to final 
draft? </b></p>
<p class="size2">I started writing the adventure in June of last year, 
and finished my work on it right around Thanksgiving (about 3 a.m. on 
Thanksgiving Day, I believe). Writing an adventure of this scope is an 
absolutely monumental task, and not for the faint of heart! Of course, 
finishing my work on it was a long way from the final draft: Rich put in
 an enormous amount of work to make the adventure even better, putting 
in another six weeks. Then the editors, Gwen and Michele, had it for 
another two months. And so on, getting it ready for release about 14 
months after I started writing.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What's new or updated for this adventure --
 magical items, spells, creatures -- that players might not have 
encountered before?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Several new monsters. I'll tantalize you 
with names: quth-maren, blood fiend, Abyssal ghoul, keening spirit, 
silveraith. Also a number of old monsters updated to the new <b>D&amp;D</b> rules. Likewise for magic items, a mix of new and updated. I'm weirdly proud of the fact that every new monster in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000">Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting</a></i> book (except the ordinary animals) appears somewhere in this adventure. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards of the Coast:</b><b>How do you expect players will react to the final adventure?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> If my playtest reports and experiences 
are any indication, players are going to have a great time kicking a lot
 of drow rear-ends and saving the world! Further, I expect players to 
learn the importance of improving saving throws, to develop clever 
strategies for reaching the surface world, and to deeply loathe a 
certain drow cleric. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Really, you just can't have enough<i> death ward</i> spells and<i> scrolls of resurrection.</i> That's the big takeaway I expect for most players.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards:</b><b>Any plans for a follow-up adventure?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> As I mentioned before, I do plan to run these characters for a while longer, so we can all have a taste of the new <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881690000">Epic Level Handbook</a></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881690000">'s</a>
 rules. I expect the earth to keep shaking for several months to come. 
Whether anything, in print or online, will materialize for public 
consumption, I can't predict.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> I know that Dave Noonan's working on a <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dungeon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20020906a">Dungeon </a></i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dungeon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20020906a">magazine</a> piece that can be used as a side-mission based on<i> City of the Spider Queen.</i> Other than that, if you survive the<i> City of the Spider Queen,</i> well, your characters deserve a little break.</p>
