<p><b>Team Interview with Jonathan Tweet, Michael Donais, Rob Heinsoo, Stacy Longstreet, and Mary Elizabeth Allen</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2006-24%20-%20Giants%20of%20Legend%20Team%20Interview_files/mx_hugepack_2up.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="201" width="251"></b>In this exclusive interview, the team behind the latest Miniatures expansion set, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mg/20040617a">Giants of Legend</a></i>, discuss what it takes to make the game Huge and how fans have helped get it to the size it is today.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Bringing twelve Huge creatures 
to the table must have required a certain amount of debate about which 
ones to include and which ones to leave for future sets. How did you 
decide what goes in? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan Tweet:</b> We wanted to give players a range of Huge creatures from the classic and recognizable to the new and unusual. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Michael Donais:</b> And we weren't sure how long it 
would be before we could do another Huge set, so we tried to put a lot 
of really cool minis in this set. The two dragons and the two giants are
 creatures that all GMs want. We also included a lot of the Huges that 
really say <b>D&amp;D</b>, like the Treant, Bullette, and Glabrezu.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rob Heinsoo:</b> As Mike and Jonathan have suggested, we wanted to start by givingpeople some of the classic <b>D&amp;D</b> monsters, particularly since we've been thinking of <i>Giants of Legend</i> as <b>D&amp;D</b>'s 30th anniversary set. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mary Elizabeth Allen:</b> Exactly. So while folks will recognize some of the tried-and-true <b>D&amp;D</b> monsters such as dragons and giants, they also get a taste of the all-new <b>Eberron</b>
 setting in the Warforged Titan. By including both the classic and the 
new, it celebrates the 30th anniversary milestone while showing that <b>D&amp;D</b> will always have more to offer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: What do each of you bring to 
the table as a new set comes to life? What are your roles, what's the 
process, what's the schedule like? Who else is involved bringing it all 
together? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan:</b> I helped define how the Huge packs are 
configured and what goes into them. As a design manager, I balance 
business realities with the needs of the game. I also support Rob and 
the other people working directly on the set. I help them get the time 
and resources they need to do all the cool things they do. For example, I
 make a point of answering questions for online interviews so that Rob 
can spend less time on his own answers and more time finishing art 
orders.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rob:</b> Well, I just finished the art order. As lead
 designer, I set the tone for each expansion's theme by choosing the set
 lists, with an eye toward supporting both skirmish battles and the RPG.
 I write the art order describing each mini, which goes over to the art 
director, Stacy Longstreet. Then I design the minis, either by starting 
with <b>D&amp;D</b> RPG stats and evoking them for the skirmish or 
starting with special abilities and effects we want in the skirmish 
system and tailoring creatures to match. I usually start by figuring out
 the commander effects and playable warband types that will be supported
 by the new set, aiming to make fun and powerful creatures and warband 
twists for every faction. On many sets, Rob Watkins, the <i>Star Wars</i>
 minis designer, helps by statting out some of the class-level player 
character types. Sometimes the initial design works out, other times it 
has to be redone, either because the art is cool and different from what
 we expected, or because the development process run by Mike Donais 
uncovers problems or comes up with better ways to keep factions distinct
 and gameplay interesting. I usually help develop the sets as a 
half-member of Mike's development team, coming up with some of the 
solutions for questions I got wrong the first time. And when the 
development team is satisfied with what we've got, Rob Watkins, Jonathan
 Tweet, and Jennifer Clarke-Wilkes help finish off the details of the 
RPG cards, checking or completing the <b>D&amp;D</b> RPG stats before the set leaves development to go to Jennifer when she's wearing her editor hat. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2006-24%20-%20Giants%20of%20Legend%20Team%20Interview_files/72GoL71HugeRedDragon.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="381" width="301">Michael:</b>
 I am the lead developer on the set. That means I and my team of 
developers go over all of the minis and tune them to be more 
understandable and to play smoothly. We make sure it appeals to each 
type of audience and that each faction is represented. We also cost all 
of the minis and make sure that enough of them have cool stuff going on.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mary Elizabeth: </b>As brand manager, I'm tasked with
 setting the strategic direction of each expansion set (and the 
Miniatures line as a whole). To do so, I work with every team involved 
in the process of creating and selling a miniature, from R&amp;D and 
Production to Finance and Sales, to pull together their feedback and set
 a course of action. I'm a touchpoint for information, for both the 
entire Miniatures team as well as upper management. I work with outside 
business partners and our PR team to further the market breadth of the 
product line, and I'm responsible for writing and executing marketing 
plans for every set. All this while keeping us under budget and helping 
wherever I can to make sure our fans get the best product they can!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stacy Longstreet:</b> As the art director, it is my 
job to assign various artists to sketch the miniature, both front side 
and back. Based on the character/monster, I decide which artists will do
 the best job capturing the "essence" of that particular creature. The 
artists usually have about eight weeks to present first a rough sketch 
and then a final sketch based on feedback.<br> The final sketches are 
sent to our sculptors, who turn the two-dimentional art into 3-D 
sculpts. I work closely with the sculptors, fine-tuning the sculpts, 
which are then tooled and molded for final plastic production.<br> After
 we approve the initial sculpts, I receive samples that I give to 
various painters to create the paint master that the production house 
will follow. The painters usually have only ten to fourteen days to 
complete the painted samples. And that is doing two of each model! One 
will get sent out for production and one is kept in-house as a 
reference.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: I'm sure each of you has favorite figures from <i>Giants of Legend </i>-- there are some true classics in here, and the designs are spectacular. What figures are each of you especially fond of?</b><i></i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan:</b> The Huge Red Dragon has a special place in my heart. In my <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign, I used it for the PCs' nemesis, and it handed the party one of its very few defeats.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rob:</b> I love the Young Master, because the sculpt 
is wonderful and because his commander effect creates a fun, new warband
 type, all monks.I also like the wonkiness of the Lich Necromancer, and 
its sculpt turned out well. All the Huges are great, but I'm 
particularly fond of the two dragons and the Fomorian. The Frost Giant 
and the Fire Giant are great sculpts. I'm really happy with the 
fourcommanders that we drew from many appearances in various 
incarnations of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game: Lord Soth, Mordenkainen, Lareth
 the Beautiful, and King Snurre. They're good-looking minis, and between
 them they've got everything from raw power to chaotic randomness. As 
commanders, they're each capable of defining a warband. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mary Elizabeth:</b> My favorites are: 1) the Behir, 
because it literally took my breath away seeing that something so 
complicated can also look that good, and that we used such brilliant 
shades of blue; 2) the Bullette--that metallic paint is so striking; and
 3) I agree with Rob that the Fire Giant came off really well overall.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2006-24%20-%20Giants%20of%20Legend%20Team%20Interview_files/72GoL61HugeGoldDragon.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="410" width="296">Michael:</b>
 Of the huges, I like the Gold Dragon the best. Of the non-Huges I was 
very happy to see Lord Soth because of his history. He turned out great.
 The Quasit is also a favorite of mine because he is our first Tiny-size
 mini.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stacy:</b> My favorites in this set are the Huge Gold Dragon and the Behir. They just look really COOL!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Does this set introduce any new
 rules or rules concepts? How about creature abilities? The Lich 
Necromancer seems to have required some special attention.</b><i></i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Michael:</b> Each set introduces something new, 
either new commander effects or new spells or some creatures that cannot
 be captured without creating a new ability. These are the abilities 
that we have to test the most during development, and they often change 
so that we end up with something that is both fun and interesting to 
play.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rob:</b> Like Mike said, we bring new abilities into 
every set. This time around, I'm fond of the humble Dire Rat. It's not 
only a common mini that RPG players are going to want lots of, it's a 
common mini with a Pack Hunter ability that lets it operate without a 
commander if it has a lot of other Dire Rats with it. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan:</b> The Otyugh introduces the Constrict 
ability. The Otyugh can make enemy creatures lose their next turns when 
it hits them, and anything that gives me an excuse to put an Otyugh on 
the table is a good thing.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast:</b><i></i><b>Amidst all these 
Huge creatures comes one Tiny one, a Quasit. What was the design 
philosophy behind including the Quasit in this particular expansion? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan:</b> The quasit is a classic monster, and we wanted good, classic monsters and characters in this set.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Michael:</b> We also wanted something that people 
could use to represent various Tiny-size creatures. And we wanted to 
know how Tiny-size creatures would turn out. This set was particularly 
well suited to including a Tiny creature because when you get a Huge in 
every pack you won't feel bad about getting something small. Now that we
 know we can do Tiny miniatures, it gives us more options in the future.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: I see on the checklist that 
there are some restrictions in Organized Play as to the use of Huge 
creatures. Can you outline the specifics of these restrictions and the 
reasoning behind them? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan:</b> The Huges operate on a power level that
 puts them in a league of their own. We wanted to release mega-powerful 
miniatures because those are part of the <b>D&amp;D</b> universe, but we
 didn't want skirmish players to have their leagues and tournaments 
redefined by the arrival of Huges. For example, 100-point and 200-point 
warbands are standard in tournaments, but many of the Huges are over 200
 points themselves. Even for Huges that are theoretically playable in 
standard tournaments, their size alone means that they don't interact 
well with the terrain that's designed for creatures of size Large and 
smaller.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To give players a way to play Huges while keeping the 
standard tournaments on their own scale, we created a parallel 
tournament format with 500-point warbands and special terrain rules.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Michael:</b> Huge creatures have two problems in 
organized play. One is that they cannot manuever well on the 
battlefield. Terrain hinders them too much. The game was designed for 
Large minis but not Huges. We are printing up a full-color poster map 
for use with Huge minis. People playing in certain OP leagues or in one 
of our <i>Giants of Legends</i> release events will get one at the 
event. The second problem is that Huges are way more powerful than 
normal miniatures. There is no place on the battlefield for a 300-point 
mini when you have minis that cost 3 points. We set their costs 
carefully but that doesn't really solve the problem. They are fun to 
play because of their sheer might, but I have been sticking to games 
with no Huges for the most part, and I expect many other people will, 
too.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: What's been fan reaction to the
 miniatures expansions in the past? Does fan feedback help determine 
where you go next, what you include or don't include in a particular 
set, or how often you schedule releases? Are there particular creatures,
 Huge or otherwise, that fans clamor for? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jonathan: </b>We constantly read the boards here on 
the Wizards website as well as meeting fans at tournaments and 
conventions. We take fan feedback seriously, and some upcoming 
miniatures are entirely the result of specific fan suggestions. The two 
creatures I've seen the most demand for are the gelatinous cube and 
Meepo, the kobold from Sunless Citadel.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rob:</b> Happily, a lot of the time fans want things 
that we already have in the works, since we're working on releases that 
are many months away. It's hard to keep quiet in these cases -- you want
 to say, "Hey, good news, we're doing it!" Other times, fans suggest 
things we haven't thought of already. I can think of at least five times
 that a fan suggestion made me take a mini out of an art order and 
replace it with something closer to the fan's idea. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mary Elizabeth:</b> Just to echo what Rob and 
Jonathan stated, yes, fan feedback is key. There will always be a fan 
looking for that one particular mini that we haven't released yet! 
Overall, feedback on <b>D&amp;D</b> minis has been very positive. It's 
particularly cool that as we've been working to improve the quality of 
our miniatures with each set, our fans have noticed and let us know 
about it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Michael:</b> We read the forums and we often talk 
about what the fans want. Fan feedback effects what goes in a set. 
Sometimes fans just give ideas of what they like or don't like but in 
one or two cases they created a long petition to get a certain mini into
 the game!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: What's the next expansion on 
the horizon that players can look forward to? And are there more Huge 
creatures in design? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mary Elizabeth:</b> The next expansion set is <i>Aberrations</i>,
 which as you can infer from the name will have very cool, bizarre 
creatures -- and some awesome new heroes -- from all parts of <b>D&amp;D</b>, <b>Forgotten Realms</b>, and <b>Eberron</b>. That expansion releases in October.</p>
