 emerge from the hidden corridors of a forgotten tomb to discuss the 
latest sourcebook! In the interests of better involving the player 
community with the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, questions for this interview 
were solicited in part via the message boards. Our thanks to everyone 
who took the time to submit their questions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b> First off, congratulations on <i>Dungeonscape</i>!
 Of course, what could be more iconic to the game than a sourcebook all 
about the first half of its name. Fittingly, the book looks to be split 
with information for both players and dungeon-designing DMs. If you 
don't mind, let's start with a few questions on the players' side:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Dungeonscape</i> introduces a new base class, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/charactersheets"> the factotum</a>
 (previously known as the journeyman), advertised as a 
jack-of-all-trades. How so? What sets it apart from the other classes, 
and from the previous "jack," the bard? (Some have criticized the bard 
as such, as it can't find traps, turn undead, cast spells like <i>fireball, finger of death</i> and <i>magic missile</i>, and--arguably--survive melee.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason Bulmhan: </b> Unlike the bard and other 
jack-of-all-trade classes, the factotum can be truly skilled at nearly 
any role he is called to fill. Utilizing an ability called 
"inspiration", the factotum can cast spells like a wizard (with a bit 
more flexibility), master any skill, take extra actions, sneak attack, 
and swing a sword with the best fighter. Since these points refresh at 
every encounter, the factotum always finds a way to be useful in 
practically every situation. The class has a number of other great 
features as well, such as having every skill as a class skill, 
trapfinding, the ability to heal like a paladin, and turn undead. What I
 find really appealing though, is that this is perhaps the best class 
out there for running a campaign with only a single player. The factotum
 really can do it all.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich Burlew: </b> I don't have much to add here, this
 class was really Jason's baby. I will say that I was surprised when I 
first read it that it was capable of temporarily filling a role without 
doing it so well that the class dedicated to that role would become 
obsolete.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-05%20-%20Dungeonscape_files/dx20070305_spotlight_barbarian.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="193" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b> As for the standard classes, what might <i>Dungeonscape </i>offer them? What new features, feats, or gear could help make them all the better intrepid dungeoneers?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b> Each of the standard classes has at least one alternate class ability in <i>Dungeonscape</i>,
 designed to make the character a better dungeon delver. While some of 
these options are as simple as giving the ranger trapfinding, others 
have a twist more suited to the class focus. Take the barbarian, for 
example; his alternate class ability allows him to attack traps to 
disable them, using his attack bonus instead of Disable Device. That is 
not to say that all of the class abilities deal with traps. The druid's 
alternate class feature gives him the ability to empathize with vermin, 
move over difficult earthen terrain, and resist the powers of mind 
flayers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Aside from alternate class abilities, <i>Dungeonscape</i> gives a host of new feats and a sizable list of new gear options. We pulled many of these items from old supplements like the <i>Dungeoneer's Survival Guide</i>
 and gave them fresh new rules and uses. Old favorites like the drill, 
collapsible pole, listening cone, and hacksaw are back. The book also 
includes a number of new alchemical and magical items, as well as item 
kits: simple lists of items no respectable dungeoneer should go without.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> With the equipment options, we tried to 
focus on noncombat utility. The game already has a long list of items 
that are useful in battle, but far fewer that aid in exploration and 
movement. So we added items that help an adventurer deal with the 
physical obstructions that are common in dungeons, from an adamantine 
hacksaw to the good old iron spike. We took the same approach with magic
 items, providing new items that assist in security, mobility, and trap 
avoidance rather than combat power.<br></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> What of prestige classes? I see the trapsmith: how does this PrC relate to (and better deal with) its namesake traps?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b> There are two prestige classes for PCs in
 the book (and one for DMs... the Dungeon Lord). The first is the Beast 
Heart Adept, who takes a druid's affinity for animals and uses similar 
skills to harness and befriend monsters. The trapsmith is a really a 
master at dealing with all sorts of magical and mechanical traps. He 
also learns a number of useful abilities allowing him to set up quick 
traps to secure a camp, guard a hallway, or otherwise harm or delay 
intruders. The trapsmith also learns a limited number of spells, most of
 which function like traps or allow him to deal with traps more 
effectively.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> Basically, both prestige classes are about
 putting the dungeon's tools into the hands of the players. The Beast 
Heart Adept really lets the players get their hands on one of the cool 
iconic things about <b>D&amp;D</b> that they never really get to touch: 
the monsters. Everywhere he goes, he gets to bring with him a monstrous 
companion (similar to a druid's animal companion) that might be anything
 from an owlbear to a hippogriff. As he gains in power, he gains 
additional monster allies. Players who enjoy tactical strategy will 
really appreciate the class, too, since it gives the character benefits 
for coordinating his attacks with those of his pets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Don't forget the Dungeon Lord, though. Designed strictly
 with villains in mind, it gives them a variety of powerful abilities 
while in their own dungeon. It's the ultimate "home field advantage" 
class. Personally, I find it very helpful when creating a dungeon 
overlord that is <i>not </i>a primary spellcaster for once, since 
Dungeon Lords gain limited ability to move through and spy on the 
dungeon with spell-like abilities. But its entry requirements are also 
easy for many monsters to meet; the example dungeon lord is a mind 
flayer with no other class levels beyond those from this class.<br></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-05%20-%20Dungeonscape_files/dx20070305_spotlight_rotgrub.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="231" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b>
 This takes us into the dungeon design side of things, as traps and 
their functionality raised quite a few questions on the message boards. 
For starters, can we assume the book introduces new traps? Are there 
variations on the standard death traps (essentially, find them or die)? 
Perhaps intricate devices on the order of the <i>Book of Challenges</i>?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b><i>Dungeonscape</i> provides an entire chapter devoted to traps. Of that, most of it is devoted to encounter traps, a concept first introduced in <i>Secret's of Xen'drik</i>.
 Basically, encounter traps are mechanical or magical devices that 
function more like combat encounters. The goal is to engage the entire 
group in a trap, instead of just the rogue making a few skill checks. 
When an encounter trap goes off, every party member has something to 
contribute, from attack trap mechanisms, disarming parts, or simple 
defending themselves. <i>Dungeonscape</i> presents all the rules needed 
to design and run encounter traps as well as a large host of sample 
traps ready to be used in any dungeon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition to encounter traps, this chapter also 
provides a bunch of rules to present high level standard traps, 
including more deadly poisons, gigantic weapons, and various other 
options. Finally, the trap chapter provides info on how to design 
complex traps (with diagrams with a number of examples), boon traps 
(meant to help dungeon defenders), psionic traps, and a number of 
hazards. I have to say I am most proud of those hazards. Plus, finally 
the rot grub is back, to the woe of players everywhere. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> This is basically <i>the </i>book on 
traps. I know a lot of DMs who don't use many traps in their adventures;
 they claim that they slow the adventure down by turning every corridor 
into an endless series of Search checks. Alternately, they might say 
that traps aren't very effective, because the PCs can just heal any trap
 damage they take moments later. This book will show you how to use 
traps in a fun and exciting way, and how to get the most bang from your 
trap buck. Traps that are more clever, work better with other 
encounters, and just add something to the dungeon experience other than a
 bunch of extra skill checks. Plus, if you've ever wanted to literally 
fling your PCs 2000 feet out of the dungeon? We've got you covered.<br></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2007%20-%2003-05%20-%20Dungeonscape_files/dx20070305_spotlight_web.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="277" width="240">Wizards: </b> To continue venturing to the DM-side of things. As one DM has challenged: What's in <i>Dungeonscape</i> that could convince me to include more dungeons in my game? How does it make the prospect of dungeon-crawls more attractive?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b><i>Dungeonscape</i> covers all the reasons
 why a dungeon should exist, giving you a ton of ideas on how to 
incorporate these iconic settings in a seamless and believable way. The 
book attempts to explain why the dungeon is an important component of <b>D&amp;D</b> , while at the same time giving you a mountain of options to make your dungeons unique and exciting for both the DM and player.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> Dungeons are most associated with combat 
encounters in the mind of many players, and while they can be so much 
more (and we discuss how), we didn't want to disappoint those players 
who <i>like </i>combat encounters. One of the sections of which I'm 
proudest discusses combat encounters in a dungeon and how to use the 
dungeon's inherent qualities to enhance your battles. Using a dungeon 
grants you more precise control over the manner in which an encounter 
transpires than you could hope to have in the wilderness. The DM gets to
 control, within limits, the range, direction, and exact location of a 
given battle. Knowing how to use these tools allows you to build tactics
 into your encounters from the beginning, rather than struggling to 
decide what monsters will do after the battle is joined during your game
 session. We also give you a lot of tips on how to keep a fight that 
should be a challenge from being a pushover; if you've ever had your 
BBEG killed in one round, we have advice for you.<br></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> As for the dungeons themselves, does 
the book focus on the traditional dungeon (that is, underground with 
multiple levels, each one deeper than the last and populated by tougher 
monsters)? Or does it venture into stranger locations, encounters, 
features (and, any of which you'd care to share)?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b> The book tries to service both the 
traditional dungeon, like those found under a keep, and stranger 
locations, like the fleshy labyrinth of a demon lord. One portion of the
 design chapter in specific gives ideas for both the mundane and 
unusual, describing each of the room types typically found in a dungeon 
while covering a number of options to make them better fit their 
environment. The library in most dungeons consists of stacks of old 
musty tomes, but in the dungeon of a fiend, it might consist of bound 
souls who are forced to answer the questions of their tormentors. There 
are also rules to support all sorts of dungeons, from walls of magma to 
doors of ice to floors of angry zombie flesh.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> In terms of story function, it mainly 
focuses on the traditional dungeon--where the traditional dungeon is 
defined as: "A series of rooms connected by corridors that feature 
combat encounters, traps, and obstacles that are unknown before they are
 encountered sequentially." In other words, if you have to explore room 
by room to determine what's there, and the avenues of travel between 
rooms are limited, then it's a dungeon, whether it's below ground or in 
the clouds. If the various locations are either known or easily 
identifiable (as in a city), or there are a near infinite number of 
paths you could take between Point A and Point B (as in the wilderness),
 then it's not a dungeon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-05%20-%20Dungeonscape_files/dx20070305_spotlight_shark.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="262" width="225"><b>Wizards: </b> Any favorite creatures to populate the dungeon with? Or creature types?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b> While there was not enough room for too many monsters, a couple did manage to find their way into the pages of <i>Dungeonscape</i>,
 including the ascomoid and the rot grub swarm. In addition to these 
classics, there are a host of templates that allow you to import 
monsters into a dungeon or to make them more deadly inhabitants. One of 
my favorite bits in that part of the book are alternate feat lists for 
some classic monsters, giving them an interesting twist and keeping your
 PCs guessing.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> The templates will really broaden the use 
of some monsters that are otherwise difficult to use in a dungeon. In 
particular, the Dungeonbreed template allows you to shrink a monster to 
fit the confined spaces of a dungeon without weakening its combat power.
 And there's a stat block for a giant shark that swims in acid, and 
seriously, what evil mastermind doesn't want one of those for his 
dungeon?<br></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Finally, in creating the book, were you
 able to reach back to memorable dungeons and adventures you 
experienced, either as a player or DM, that you incorporated into <i>Dungeonscape</i>? Any famous dungeon modules you went through that may have inspired questions or features?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-05%20-%20Dungeonscape_files/dx20070305_spotlight_tomb.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="229" width="240"><b>Jason: </b>
 I have played a through a lot of dungeons in my day. From my first 
doomed character who picked up a yellow mold-covered dinner plate in the
 red box adventure to the hoards I lost in <i>Tomb of Horrors</i>, dungeons have always been a favorite game setting for me. When writing <i>Dungeonscape</i>,
 I tried to instill a lot of the things that made some of those dungeons
 great, from unexpected challenges to cunning and deadly traps. I 
remember digging through <i>Queen of the Demonweb Pits</i> when drawing 
up some of the wall and door ideas when I quite suddenly realized that I
 had not included surfaces made out of webs. Some of the horrible traps 
in <i>Tomb of Horrors</i> inspired some of the ideas for encounter traps (along with a heaping dose of Indiana Jones). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rich: </b> Funny that Jason mentioned that: I 
actually watched all three Indiana Jones movies with a notebook while 
brainstorming for the traps chapter! </p>
<p align="LEFT">But yeah, I agree that our goal with this book is to 
inspire players to really take a look at the dungeon as part of the core
 of what the game is about. There's something thrilling about stocking 
up with all forms of survival gear and descending to the depths of the 
earth with no knowledge of what awaits you. The dungeon removes players 
from the safety of the city and forces them to deal with an alien 
environment that is, in all likelihood, actively attempting to kill 
them. Honestly, just rereading my copy of it in preparation for this 
interview put ideas in my head for an old-school actually-below-ground 
dungeon campaign. If you like it best when <b>D&amp;D</b> is actually about literal dungeons and/or dragons, we tried to write this book for you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jason: </b> Of interesting note with this book, a lot
 of the mood and tone of classic dungeon crawls went into the art of 
this book. We had an interesting idea for the art of this book and 
attempted to tell a tale with the illustrations, starting with the 
heroes preparing to go on an adventure, only to have the mighty dungeon 
claim them one by one. I'll let you guess which iconic manages to 
survive.</p>
