<p align="LEFT">In the interests of better involving the player community with the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, questions for this interview were solicited in part via the <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=10202031">message boards</a>. Our thanks to everyone for their participation.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast asks: </b> Let's start with <i>Cityscape</i>'s
 approach to cities in general: how does this book present them as more 
than mere stats but as social and cultural entities? Perhaps that's an 
overly broad question, which we'll dive into following, but is there a 
general philosophy for how the book examines <b>D&amp;D</b> 's cities?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2011-10%20-%20Cityscape_files/dx20061110_city1.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="179" width="240">Ari Marmell: </b>
 While I don't know that C.A. and I had a single definable "philosophy" 
going into Cityscape, we did have a few specific goals and mandates. 
Perhaps the most important was that we wanted the book to provide the 
tools to make gaming in an urban environment as different an experience 
as the DM and players wanted it to be. While you certainly can use 
Cityscape as nothing more than a guide to running a "street crawl" or 
"sewer crawl" adventure, we tried to delve into much more depth than 
just that. We discussed how the construction and appearance of a city 
changes based on its social structure, location, and purpose. We 
provided all manner of tools for playing games that involve politics, 
guilds, contacts, and the like.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Trying to tie this back into your initial question 
without getting too off-track, I'd guess that if did have a general 
philosophy, you could sum it up as follows: A single city should be able
 to serve not only as a site for adventure, but as the setting for an 
entire campaign, and Cityscape should support one as thoroughly as it 
does the other.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>C.A. Suleiman: </b> To add a bit more: our mandate 
was to provide as self-contained a sourcebook on the "urban environment"
 as we possibly could, given the page-count. We wanted DMs to be able to
 run not just one, but numerous urban campaigns, each one distinct from 
the others, with just the three core books and <i>Cityscape.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards asks: </b> Now, diving into the cities themselves. What types does <i>Cityscape</i>
 examine: is the focus on human settlements, or are the cities of other 
races also covered? What about higher magic areas, or other unusual 
cities? Is there setting specific information, for cities within <b>Eberron</b> and the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> ?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> Well, we start with human cities as a baseline, certainly. Humans are the majority race in most <b>D&amp;D</b>
 settings, they're the race players can empathize with the most (for 
obvious reasons), and it allows us to pull certain historical analogues 
and examples that might not be appropriate for other races. That said, 
it would be foolish for us not to address the other races, as they're so
 much a part of the <b>D&amp;D</b> experience. The book does, indeed, 
spend some time discussing how the cities of other races differ from 
those of humans, and even how some monstrous races adapt to city living.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Similarly, the book does indeed take some time to 
address certain high-magic or other unusual cities. (For instance, the 
notion of flying or planar cities is addressed in brief.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">We don't have much in the way of setting-specific information for <b>Eberron</b> or the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 . C.A. and I really wanted to make this book as widely useful and 
adaptable as possible. That said, the book certainly works very well 
with other city sources such as Sharn: City of Towers or Waterdeep: City
 of Splendors.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>C.A. Suleiman: </b> As Ari says, there isn't too much specific information about either <b>Eberron</b> or the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 , because this book was designed for the environment series of the core
 line. And given our mandate, it would have been a disservice to focus 
too heavily on setting-specific information, when such information 
already exists for those specifically seeking it out.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2011-10%20-%20Cityscape_files/dx20061110_city2.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="181" width="240">Wizards asks: </b> To look at one of the recent campaign specific sourcebooks, though: <i>Power of Faerun</i> offered material on gaining power and prestige in that campaign setting. Does <i>Cityscape </i>offer similar opportunity to become involved in a city's political system? What might this involvement mean for players?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> Well, I can't speak to how similar 
the specifics might be, but yes, Cityscape offers substantial 
opportunity for players to become involved in the politics of the city. 
The book not only discusses political systems, but offers specific 
details on joining/gaining the patronage of houses, guilds, churches, 
and organizations, all of which can (and should) play major parts in the
 political and social power of a city. The book also summarizes/expands 
on the system of urban law first presented in the DMG II. Even if the 
PCs are not themselves part of such a group, the use of the contacts 
system means they can always have eyes and ears in the halls of power.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>C.A. Suleiman: </b> In addition to the wealth of 
material on houses, guilds, churches, and organizations, there's one 
section devoted to political systems and another devoted to the role of 
politics in a city's history.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards asks: </b> Speaking of which, the <i>DMG II</i> introduced guilds and the <i>PHB II </i>new organizations, both of which seem natural for a city setting. How does <i>Cityscape </i>make use of these concepts?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> As I said before, we made full use 
of the introduction of guilds, building/expanding on the systems 
presented in the DMG II. We've expanded the concept to cover guilds, 
smaller organizations, churches, and political/mercantile houses. We've 
also included a vast array of samples, enough so that even a DM who 
doesn't feel like creating his own shouldn't run out any time soon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And even if you choose not to use the specific mechanics provided for joining a guild, or gaining contacts throughout the city, <i>Cityscape</i>'s
 sample guilds/groups/etc. should provide all manner of ideas for what 
sorts of organizations hold the power in the city, and who the PC might 
be working for... or against.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>C.A. Suleiman: </b> As both <i>DMG II</i> and <i>PHB II</i> are supplements, we couldn't enter into our work on <i>Cityscape</i>
 under the assumption that buyers would own those books, too. Rather, we
 designed a complete urban environment system from the ground up, one 
that features similarities with existing material (so as not to provide 
obstacles to play), but which nonetheless stands entirely on its own.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards asks: </b> For most parties, a trip to the city usual involves shopping, healing, and research. How does <i>Cityscape </i>handle these topics?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> In addition to providing numerous 
sample locations in which such tasks can take place, Cityscape includes 
sidebars on all of these topics, providing tools for the DM to make such
 efforts as detailed--or as quick--as he and the players prefer. (This 
includes, in many cases, random features of a shop or vendor, to give 
each such task a life of its own.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>C.A. Suleiman: </b> As Ari said, there are sample 
locations and sidebars on everything from healing costs to sample NPC 
contacts who can provide such aid. But it's worth noting that the book 
presupposes campaigns (or at least story arcs) that are largely <i>set </i>in
 a city, and so the focus isn't on using the city (or the book) to just 
drop in a bit of flavor when the party flies through on their way to 
somewhere else (though Cityscape certainly provides enough material to 
do such with ease).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2011-10%20-%20Cityscape_files/dx20061110_city3.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="310" width="240">Wizards asks: </b> And then there's the seedier side of urban life. Does <i>Cityscape </i>touch
 upon organized crime, black markets, and the like? What of things below
 the literal surface: sewers, catacombs, and dungeons (in the prison 
sense)? What of PCs who run afoul of the law (they can't make every Open
 Lock check, after all); while the <i>DMG II</i> covered legal systems, where does <i>Cityscape </i>take this topic?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> Organized crime is included in the 
houses and guilds, as well as in the contacts system, permitting the PCs
 to interact with the criminal element as much or as little as they 
like, and either as allies or enemies--subject to the intentions of the 
DM, of course!</p>
<p align="LEFT">And yes, we devote space toward the literal underbelly 
of the city as well. We've provided a plethora of information on sewage 
systems in <b>D&amp;D</b> cities, the better to construct a crawl with its own... scent.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Again, I think I jumped ahead of the topic a while back,
 but Cityscape does make use of the law rank system initially presented 
in DMG II. (As a quick aside, I know I've mentioned DMG II several times
 now. I want to say, to avoid confusion, that Cityscape is fully usable 
without it. There's a lot of good stuff in DMG II for an urban campaign,
 but like almost all other <b>D&amp;D</b> books, Cityscape was written to require only the core books.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards asks: </b> What can you tell us about the risks of city environments: what sorts of creatures does <i>Cityscape</i> introduce that adventurers would do well to avoid? And who are those villains we've seen listed in the table of contents?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> Cityscape does include several 
brand new monsters, and we tried to make sure all of them fit well into 
the fantasy city. The siege golem, as you might expect from the name, is
 a construct designed for laying low a city's walls (and defenders) 
during war. The cesspit ooze is, well, yucky (in a good way, at least 
where DMs are concerned). The ripper is a serial-killing aberration with
 senses-dulling pheromones, while the sepulchral thief is sort of the 
lich of the criminal community. A pest swarm is more or less what it 
sounds like (as well as serving as the basis for one of our new spells),
 and the zeitgeist is literally the spirit of the city, a truly powerful
 fey that is the living heart of an urban community</p>
<p align="LEFT">In an urban adventure, though, one usually expects the 
bulk of the opposition to be humanoid, and we've tried to facilitate 
that as well. Cityscape includes stat blocks for a great many foes you'd
 expect in the city, from city guards to professional thieves to hired 
thugs--as well as less combative types, like politicians and 
craftsmen--enough so that the DM can populate many an adventure without 
having to create a plethora of stat blocks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2011-10%20-%20Cityscape_files/dx20061110_city4.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="315" width="240">As far as specific villains, Cityscape includes four, at varying levels. Each is focused on one of the primary aspects of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 skills. Clyrrik is a stealthy killer; Doucral a brutal thug; Father 
Darius a divine threat eating away at the heart of the city; and the 
Symbol a truly creepy arcane malignancy. (C.A. did a great job on this 
last one. Even the Symbol's familiar is freaky!) Each is designed to be 
specific enough for immediate use, but generic enough to fit into almost
 any city. DMs can use them as written, or as models for their own 
urban-style "Big Bads".</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards asks: </b> Perhaps the greatest risk to cities might not be individual threats, but larger events. Does <i>Cityscape</i> look at such things as natural (or unnatural) disasters? And how might PCs become involved with, or even help prevent them?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> Indeed it does. While I might wish 
we'd had more space to devote to them, the truth is that any one such 
event--an earthquake, a riot, an invasion--can serve as the basis for an
 entire book-length adventure unto itself. As it is, we tried at the 
very least to discuss how each of these impacts the city as a whole, and
 what the PCs might do to get involved (or, alternatively, to escape).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards asks: </b> For their good work, what sorts of rewards does <i>Cityscape </i>offer
 PCs? New spells? Ways to become involved in business, organizations, or
 other ways of making a few coins outside of the dungeon?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ari Marmell: </b> Cityscape does indeed present a 
variety of new spells (to say nothing of feats) that are particularly 
well-suited to the urban environment. Any one of these would be a 
valuable prize to the casters of the party.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In terms of more concrete awards, though, yes. Cityscape
 gives basic income guidelines for many standard professions. Further, 
the guild/house/organization rules provide for the PCs to earn some 
money on the side, and even to gain a few benefits they can apply 
directly to their more adventuresome activities. There are even rules 
for determining how much money a fighter can earn in the gladiatorial 
arena. Of course, the guilds and organizations expect the PCs to earn 
that income; nothing's free or easy in the city any more than it is in 
the dungeon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>C.A. Suleiman: </b> At the risk of sounding pedantic,
 I'd say that the biggest reward this book offers is to the players, not
 their characters. The rules serve the story, even in <b>D&amp;D</b>, 
and I like to think that we did a good job providing a resource that 
would help players and DMs tell a multitude of entertaining city-based 
stories.</p>
