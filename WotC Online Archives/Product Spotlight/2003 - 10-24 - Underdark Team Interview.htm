<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards of the Coast: Years' worth of publications -- game products, novels, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20031024a">Dragon</a></i>
 articles -- have expanded the Underdark into a complex campaign 
setting. How did you sort through all those previous releases to create a
 more definitive sourcebook in <i>Underdark</i>? </b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jeff Quick:</b> I was the editor of Eric Boyd's exhaustively detailed 2nd edition sourcebook, <i>Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark</i>. Eric, as <b>Forgotten Realms</b> fans know, is a detail nut. When he wrote it, he consulted pretty much every Underdark reference ever -- including <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/bio/rasalvatore">Bob Salvatore</a>, </span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">personally.
 So rather than duplicate effort, I turned to that book for inspiration 
and to Eric for a few details and opinions. I advanced some things from 
Eric's book; very little is exactly the same. But you'll see plenty of 
continuity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce Cordell:</b>
 One of the most freeing aspects of the book is that roughly two-thirds 
of it is new material, or at least new treatment of core Underdark 
concepts. There are new races amidst the old, new feats, new prestige 
classes, and so on, which of course requires less research into previous
 sources than actual "source" material. <br> But when it comes to source material: The designers of the 3rd Edition <i><b> Forgotten Realms </b> Campaign Setting </i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">did
 all that incredibly important but incredibly difficult work for us. As 
far as we were concerned, the FR campaign setting 3.0 was the canon. Any
 other bit of older source material we wished to bring to the table was 
frosting. That said, of course we would always look to older sources 
first when doing background material.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Baker:</b>
 As developer, I spent more time double-checking old sources and looking
 for significant references we might have missed. As it turns out, I had
 to do a lot of this research anyway for my work on <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/frnovel/886250000">Condemnation</a></i>, </span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">the third book in the War of the Spider Queen series. I found <i>Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark</i>, <i>Drow of the Underdark</i>, and <i>Menzoberranzan</i> to be the most useful resources. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn Kestrel:</b>
 Not only did I look to the various products on Underdark for 
inspiration, I sought out books on real-world caving, exploration, 
geology, and rock formations.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What was your design process with <i>Underdark</i>?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jeff:</b> My job was city write-ups, which Rich Baker then tweaked after me to catch goofy stuff I let slip.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce:</b>
 Gwen and I essentially split the first seven chapters, each 
contributing about fifty percent of the material to each. Jeff was 
charged with writing the geography chapter, and I did the adventure 
sites. Rich Baker then had the task of stitching everything together, 
smoothing everything out, developing sections that didn't fit his vision
 of the Underdark, and picking up pieces that had fallen by the wayside,
 which sometimes required significant additional design.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich:</b>
 I developed the book, as opposed to designing it. I did contribute some
 substantial design work to cover topics I thought we hadn't addressed 
in the first draft -- some notorious locales in Faerûn's Underdark, for 
example -- but in my case, it was simply a matter of filling in where I 
thought we could use some more details.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 The uninitiated might assume that the drow are the predominant (perhaps
 only!) race living in the Underdark. That misconception should clear up
 right away with the chapter on the wide variety of Underdark races. 
What's new in this chapter that even experienced belowground adventurers
 will not have encountered before?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce:</b>
 There are nine races in this chapter. A few are old monster races 
developed and written as player character races, such as the chitines </span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">and grimlocks. Others are completely new races, such as the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20031003a">deep imaskari</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> and gloamings.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich:</b>
 We also made sure that the "classic" Underdark races besides the drow 
-- specifically, the duergar and the svirfneblin -- got some attention, 
too.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 The 12 new prestige classes are extremely varied and intense. (The 
scarification ritual of the arachnomancer prestige class should lead to 
some interesting-looking PCs in the future!) Is there one that you 
anticipate will be especially popular with players?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce:</b>
 My favorite is the illithid body tamer -- though this prestige class is
 probably destined to be reserved for mind flayer NPCs. Still, it is my 
favorite.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich:</b>
 My favorite is the shadowcrafter, which Gwen Kestrel designed. I think 
it's an especially elegant concept for a prestige class, because it is 
built around a suite of under-utilized spells (<i>shadow evocation, shadow conjuration,</i> etc.) and makes them better.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn</b>:
 I agree with Bruce that the illithid body tamer is awesome. For 
player-focused prestige classes, I have two favorites: the deep diviner 
and the shadowcrafter. They both put interesting twists on aspects of 
magic (divination and shadow) that are often viewed as sub-optimal.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 Give us an overview of node magic -- what it is, how it works, and how 
it will impact players who campaign in the Underdark.</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce:</b>
 Node magic plays off the concept that the earth is riddled not only 
with pockets of precious metals and minerals, but also pockets of 
concentrated power. Those with the proper knowledge can tap these 
pockets, or nodes, for increased spellcasting effect, plus other 
goodies, including a list of granted spells.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: <i>Underdark</i>
 introduces an array of new spells (more than 40 in all) and over 20 new
 monsters. (The "all-consuming hunger" is particularly terrifying, by 
the way). What are your personal favorites among these new additions to 
the Underdark?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn</b>:
 I'm glad you like the all-consuming hunger. I guess that working on a 
project with Bruce, who is known for his wonderfully creepy monsters, I 
felt an urge to create something disgusting that I could call my own!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce</b>: My favorite monster is also the all-consuming hunger, 'cause it is yucky! <i>Stone sphere </i>is my favorite spell -- a simple concept that can play out quite well in the narrow confines of Underdark tunnels.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards: Do you find it difficult to design new spells and monsters, given how many are currently in the overall </b>D&amp;D<b> game?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce: </b>Sometimes
 it can feel difficult to design new spells and new monsters, given the 
plethora that already exists. However, the way I try to look at it is 
that each new idea is really just one more possible ingredient in yet 
another, newer idea made up of several ingredients. Like, you know, 
synthesis.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn: </b>For
 me, designing new monsters and spells is interesting, and I haven't yet
 begun to exhaust ideas. I looked at the environment and considered the 
different denizens of the place. I asked myself questions like "What 
magic would a human develop to negotiate the deep caves?" or, "What can 
be done with<i> portals</i> to make them more (or less) useful?"</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 The geography of the Underdark (and the exceptional two-page map that 
outlines the known world) is quite detailed. Pulling all of these places
 and their respective histories together in such a compact space must 
have taken an incredible amount of work. How did you produce essentially
 an entire world, its history, and some of its notable denizens in 60 
pages?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich:</b>
 Thank you! I worked very hard on that map. As far as the design 
process, well, one of the things we wanted to do is show off more of the
 Underdark than was covered in <i>Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark</i>.
 Eric Boyd thoroughly covered the Underdark of the North and the 
Underdark below the Lands of Intrigue, but didn't have space to discuss 
the rest of Faerûn. I encouraged the designers to create the Underdark 
beneath the rest of Faerûn. We decided to cover more territory in less 
exhaustive detail than <i>Drizzt's Guide</i>. I also added some design work here to help patch holes and try to smooth the new material with existing Realms canon.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jeff:</b>
 It would have been much harder to do from scratch. Fortunately, we had a
 lot to build on. My design process isn't really very glamorous. It 
mainly involved me sitting on my couch with my laptop surrounded by 
books. I did some research into real-world geology so that I could make 
more realistic settings. Not much of that made it into the final 
product, but I felt better with it behind me.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 trickiest thing for me was making dozens of disparate cultures hold 
together. Each city in the Underdark is really more like its own 
country. Because the Underdark is so inhospitable to practically 
everything except xorns, each civilization has to hoard water, food, and
 defend itself from all angles. I mean, not just have these things handy
 -- <i>hoard</i> them. Because if they don't, someone else will take it.
 Paranoia, xenophobia, and elemental hate are natural states, even if 
you're not a beholder.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Given
 those sorts of constraints, why would anyone ever do anything except 
sit in their warrens or fight? There are lots of reasons, but I had to 
figure out what they were before I could write anything reasonable. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Also,
 one of my design directives was to make it weirder the deeper we went, 
and I really like weird. Sometimes I think I've gotten too weird for the
 in-house design team, so I don't know how much survived to the final 
book, but I hope most of it. I think of the Lowerdark as a place of 
psychological horror. It's like the ocean floor with no light, lots of 
nothing, and then suddenly something terrifying and dangerous like a 
city full of mind flayers. If your DM is nice, the PCs don't all die. At
 once.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: Do you see many of these locales being expanded in future releases?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jeff: </b>I have no idea what will happen in future releases. Perhaps the tender buds of love will take root and grow.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards:
 What's next on the horizon (just an expression -- there's not much of a
 horizon underground!) for players in the Underdark? What's the </b>D&amp;D<b> design team plotting next?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce:</b> Well, I hope <i>Underdark </i>(the book coming out now) will keep people happy for at least a little while!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich:</b> For <b>Forgotten Realms</b>, next up is the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/886470000">Player's Guide to Faerûn</a></i>. </span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It will serve as your one-stop <b>D&amp;D</b>
 v.3.5 conversion for the Realms, as well as adding lots of new material
 that hadn't yet been converted to 3E and plenty of brand-new material 
designed specifically for v.3.5.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn</b>: There's also a large <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20031004a">Web enhancement</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> to support the book for people who want even more Underdark.</span></p>

 I can't say much about my "day" project, because it's a year away 
still, but at home I'm working on the first novel of The Last Mythal, a 
trilogy set in the <b>Forgotten Realms.</b><i>The Forsaken House</i> will be out next summer, if I can ever finish the darned thing.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bruce:</b> Secret, secret!
