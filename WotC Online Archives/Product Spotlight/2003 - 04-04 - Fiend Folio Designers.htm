<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards of the Coast: How is the new <i>Fiend Folio </i>compatible with the upcoming revision of the </b>D&amp;D<b> game?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b> We tried to anticipate many of the changes coming down the pike for the revised <i>Monster Manual</i>in the <i>Fiend Folio</i>.
 Some of that happened early on -- I pushed for the inclusion of an 
extraplanar subtype in this book because there are so many creatures 
that come from other planes but aren't necessarily outsiders, and then 
that type got extended to the <i>Monster Manual</i> revision. Other 
things happened while the book was in the hands of our amazing editors 
-- like changing the way skill points and feats are allocated for 
monsters so that they work just like characters. (That change is also 
previewed in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881580000">Savage Species</a></i>.) The swarm subtype is another rule we developed for the book that made its way into the revised <i>Monster Manual</i>. The much-discussed changes to damage reduction are not included in the <i>Fiend Folio</i>,
 though, because they require changes in all three core rulebooks. That 
said, we're going to make sure that revised damage reduction statistics 
for all the <i>Fiend Folio</i> monsters are available just about as soon as the revised <i>Monster Manual</i> is available.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What's new in the <i>Fiend Folio</i> for players who've been in the game for a while?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Jacobs</b>:
 I really got a kick out of the swarm subtype that James Wyatt came up 
with. It's definitely a new subtype that the game needed; swarms don't 
work like any other monster in <b>D&amp;D</b>, and it's good to have some solid baseline rules for them. I believe he used the statistics for the<i> summon swarm</i>
 spell to start and built up the subtype from there, and as a result 
there are some pretty disturbing swarm monsters in the book.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: How did so many of you come to work on this project? What was the design process like? </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Jesse Decker:</b>
 Monster books are probably a little easier to split up than most, and 
once James (Wyatt) had outlined the book's contents by monster type and 
CR, it wasn't too hard to split the monsters. Four of us worked in the 
periodicals department at the time (this was before the new company, 
Paizo, was formed), and while we were working on the book, hardly a day 
went by without someone drawing the rest of us into a discussion about 
monster design. As to how so many of us came to work on the project, I 
simply ask, who'd pass up a chance to work on the new <i>Fiend Folio</i>? </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Jacobs:</b> Each of us got a stack of monsters to design. Some of them were monsters from earlier editions to be updated to the new <b>D&amp;D</b>,
 but I'd say half were just vague concepts like "a demon with 20 Hit 
Dice" or a "mythic creature" or a "nonhorselike mount." In one case, 
Matt was designing creatures that excel at mounted combat, and he 
decided they needed a cool, unique mount of their own, so he asked me to
 use one of my "nonhorselike mount" monsters to design something that'd 
fit well with his critters.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>What was it like working with such a large team?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b>
 I was actually the person who had to coordinate the whole team. That 
meant that I spent the better part of a month figuring out what should 
go in the book (sometimes very specifically, sometimes more generally), 
putting together templates for the designers to work in, and dividing up
 the monsters among all the designers. Then I spent another month 
designing my part of the book. Every one of the designers brought such 
awesome ideas and creative implementation to the book; really, what I'm 
most impressed by is the way it hangs together as a very cool monster 
book. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Jesse Decker: </b>Working
 with these guys was easy. Our assignments from James were very clear, 
and if we didn't like a monster or wanted to make a change in the 
assignment, we just traded among ourselves. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Jacobs:</b>
 It was great working with everyone on this project. I felt a bit like 
the "new guy" at the start, but that quickly went away once I realized 
that everyone else was just as excited about the book as I was. We were 
all here at Wizards at the time, so it was easy to wander down the hall 
and trade monsters or compare special attacks or talk about weird 
prehistoric sloths or whatever.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Eric Cagle:</b>
 Since everyone that worked on the book was a pro, having such a large 
team for this book was a breeze. James had a very thorough and helpful 
outline ready at the beginning, as well as a statistics block template, 
so it was really just plug and play. It was a simple matter of looking 
at what James had outlined and picking what you wanted to do. Everyone 
had their preferences -- some people went "Oooh! Oooh! Gimme fiends!" 
while others (such as myself) dabbled in a bit of everything. There was a
 lot of horse-trading in the very beginning, which made for some weird 
conversations in the hallways: "Hey, I'll trade you an aberration and a 
new monstrous humanoid for a CR 12 magical beast and an ooze."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Chris Thomasson:</b>
 Working with so many creative people was wacky fun. We chat about 
monsters all the time anyway, but this time we had a purpose. I think 
that the collaborative effort and idea-mining that went on between the 
designers made this a super-cool book. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 Give us an overview of the three new fiend prestige classes for 
monsters: fiend of blasphemy, fiend of corruption, and fiend of 
possession.</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b>
 The fiend prestige classes are three different ways for fiends to 
develop specialties in how they deal with mortals. The fiend of 
blasphemy is a fiend who's the center of a cult. I used some of the 
ideas from the old <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article1.asp?x=ow/splash,3">Ravenloft</a></b><i> Van Richten's Guide to Fiends</i>
 to make class abilities for these guys. The fiend of corruption 
specializes in corrupting the souls of mortals. A lot of inspiration 
there came from my article for <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml"><b>Dragon</b></a> Magazine,</i>
 "Hell on Earth: The Hidden Faces of Evil." Where the fiend of blasphemy
 deals with a whole cultload of mortals, a fiend of corruption works one
 on one. The fiend of possession actually uses the possession rules from
 <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881610000">Book of Vile Darkness</a></i>
 and presents one way to give possession abilities to a fiend that 
otherwise might not have them. Each of them is a 6-level class, so a 
fiend can add these extra abilities without varying too far from the 
fiendish baseline. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: Grafts and symbionts are unusual new concepts. Can you outline these and discuss their design origins? </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b> Ingredient 1: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/ps/ps20021102a">Ed Stark</a> saying that the <i>Fiend Folio</i> should include some new rule system. Ingredient 2: The fiendish imagination of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.montecook.com">Monte Cook</a>, as expressed in the<i> Infernal Machine </i>in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882370000">Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil</a></i> (and reprinted in <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Monte
 introduced the idea of attaching demonic body parts to a mortal form. I
 took that idea and blew it up into the various grafts that appear in 
the book -- more fiendish grafts, illithid grafts, yuan-ti grafts, 
aboleth grafts. . . . The basic idea is that some of the stranger types 
of creatures in the <b>D&amp;D</b> universe engage in some pretty 
despicable practices in working with slaves and the like, grafting on 
body parts to enhance the capabilities of the graft recipients. In the 
end, these work a lot like magic items. Then there are symbionts, which 
work a little bit like grafts in that they're attached to another body. 
These ones have minds of their own, however. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 What didn't make it into the final version? Was there anything just too
 big, too terrible, or too complicated that it had to be left out? </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b> After all the designers did their work, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/ps/ps20021201a">Rich Baker</a>
 and I spent some time developing it. We ended up with more monsters 
than we could possibly fit into the book. Some of them we decided could 
work very well in an upcoming product. Others, we decided, as cool as 
they were, needed more attention than we were able to give them at the 
time. I'm hopeful that everything we cut will eventually see the light 
of day, because they were all so great. Doing the trimming was very 
difficult (so difficult, in fact, that I left most of it to Rich). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Chris Thomasson: </b>Alas,
 one of my monsters was cut for the latter reason. I got too eager and 
overwrote one monster by double the allotted space and made it a little 
too powerful for its Hit Dice. I hold out hope that I'll find a way to 
revise it and get it into another product or into an issue of <i>Dragon</i>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What are you most proud of or impressed by in this volume?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Eric Cagle: </b>I remember James saying, "There's a really good reason why it's called the '<i>Fiend' Folio</i>."
 This book is heavily slanted towards evil, vile, and downright nasty 
critters. Even the good or neutral monsters in this book are not to be 
trifled with. Now that's cool.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Erik Mona:</b>
 Like everyone's said, it was neat working with a team of professionals 
who just happened (in most cases) to be sitting within shouting 
distance. In addition to our specific assignments ("Mona, you do the 
yellow musk creeper, the skulk, a bunch of celestials, and a CR 12 ooze 
on the double!"), we each had a more nebulous assignment: create a new 
race with enough potential to become the next githyanki or mindflayer. 
Sure. No sweat. All of us conferred, and each decided to pick a 
different monster subtype, to provide gamers with a wide variety of cool
 monsters. We've got outsiders and plants and elementals and more. I was
 lucky enough to do a race of aberrations, which I called the 
ethergaunts. If by some small measure the ethergaunts make the Ethereal 
Plane even remotely interesting, I will consider it the success of my 
year, if not my entire<b> D&amp;D</b> career.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b>
 My best bits: The yuan-ti anathema, the fiend prestige classes, and 
those grafts and symbionts. The ghostly visage, the soul tick (which was
 inspired by a nightmare my wife had one night, by the way), the psionic
 sinew. . . . Weird and cool stuff, in my humble opinion.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Jesse Decker:</b>
 I'm keen on both the shadar-kai and the maulgoth, but my favorite is 
definitely the rapture locust swarm. The locusts cloud the emotions of 
their prey, surround it, and then literally rip the character apart 
while he stands frozen with euphoric bliss. Good stuff, that. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Jacobs:</b>
 My favorite of my monsters is probably the ahuizotl . . . it's a weird 
aquatic creature from Aztec mythology that's not only bizarre but just 
plain creepy. I had several "real-world mythology" creatures to design, 
so I spent quite a while scouring mythology books and the Internet for 
some new monsters of this type that have never been done up as <b>D&amp;D</b>
 monsters before, then sent the list out to the rest of the guys, and 
the ahuizotl was pretty much the only one that everyone agreed <i>must</i>
 be in the book. I mean, the thing's got a hand on the end of its tail! 
How cool is that? Runners-up for me would probably be the crawling head,
 the kaorti, the wendigo template, or the octopus tree.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matthew Sernett:</b> I really enjoyed creating the keepers and the rilmani. Both of those were intriguing monsters from the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article1.asp?x=ow/splash,3">Planescape</a></b> setting that deserved more attention. Thanks to the <i>Fiend Folio</i>, they're getting a second chance.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Chris Thomasson: </b>I'm
 most proud of the demondands. I was really nervous about doing them 
when Erik Mona told me he'd kill me if I screwed them up. I re-read the 
section on Carceri in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882420000">Manual of the Planes</a></i>
 many times, and spent the most time refining them than any two other 
monsters. I'm quite satisfied with the final result. Oh, and giant sloth
 monsters (megatherium) rule.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 Now, let's cut to the chase: What should players be really, really 
afraid of in here? In other words, what are the "If it shows up in your 
campaign, <i>run</i>!" creatures? </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b>
 The frickin' blackstone gigant. Man, oh man. There was some question 
about whether we'd pegged the CR too high on that puppy, so I threw one 
at the 12th-level PCs in my lunchtime <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882440000">Oriental Adventures</a></i>
 game. I had to explain later that it had all been a bad dream, and come
 up with a more reasonable monster for them to fight. I think it's 
pretty happy at its CR 18. Well done, Mr. Sernett. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Jesse Decker:</b>
 I'll second the warnings about the blackstone gigant and add my own 
about the maulgoth. Even against a high-level party, there's a 
reasonable chance that it can grab a character, slip through a nearby 
wall ethereally to finish that character off, and then come back later 
to pick off another character. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Jacobs:</b>
 Of my own monsters, it's probably a toss up between the crawling head 
and the myrmyxicus demon. And although the ulgurstasta's not quite as 
tough as those two, it's freaky-looking enough that it managed to scare 
off the player characters in the Thursday night game I run; it even 
forced one of the characters to use the violent thrust version of <i>telekinesis</i> on himself to get away from it faster!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Then
 there's that blackstone gigant. AIEEE! I seem to remember Matt being 
worried that it wasn't tough enough. Never fear, Matt! It's good, 
old-fashioned nightmare fuel for sure!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 new and improved disenchanter is just plain mean. And the paeliryoth 
devil might just make a lot of high-level characters break down and cry 
like babies.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Eric Cagle:</b> James is dead on with the blackstone gigant -- my character was one of those killed off by the monstrosity! </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt Sernett:</b> I just wanted to make a cool monster. I didn't want to hurt anybody. I'm so sorry Eric.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Eric Cagle:</b>
 Apology accepted. You know it's a nasty critter when combat goes like 
this: Round 1: 13th-level character approaches monster. Round 2: get 
turned to stone. Round 3, 4, 5, etc.: remain turned to stone. Stare at 
DM and other players in disbelief. Yeah, baby.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">If
 I had to choose one of the creatures that I wrote, I would go with the 
new and improved disenchanter (based on the monster that first appeared 
in the original <i>Fiend Folio</i>). It's been considerably beefed up 
from its original incarnation and poses a serious physical threat as 
well as possessing the ability to suck all the magic out of your 
favorite goodies. Stay away; stay far, far away.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Chris Thomasson:</b> Bah. The gigant's a wuss. (Someone has to stop inflating Sernett's ego.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Seriously,
 I had a large number of high-CR monsters, and I think once you reach 
the CR 13+ range, all the monsters get pretty scary. That said, the CR25
 klurichir was super fun to work on because it seemed like I couldn't 
give that dude enough abilities! The chorontyryn is also super lethal, 
since it's a super proficient spellcaster and can manipulate time.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 crawling head gives me nightmares, especially now that I've seen the 
art. Jesse Decker's shadar-kai got me really thinking about how cool the
 Plane of Shadow can be. And Erik Mona's ethergaunt takes magic to new 
places.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Erik Mona:</b>
 All of my monsters want to be your friend. They wouldn't imagine 
hurting anyone. In fact, they all volunteer to take first watch. Don't 
sweat it -- they'll wake you up when it's time to set out in the 
morning.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards of the Coast: What are you working on right now? What's next on your personal design schedule?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Wyatt:</b>
 I am busy doing design work for the brand-spankin'-new campaign setting
 we're releasing in 2004. If I said any more, that would be cheating. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Jesse Decker:</b>
 I'm wrapping up my portion of a new book from Wizards that's not due 
out until early 2004. Once that's done, I'm coauthoring a sourcebook on 
elves called <i>Bow &amp; Blade</i> with Chris Thomasson, and then I'll 
spend the rest of the year writing a big rulebook for Green Ronin. All 
that said, though, my weeks (and most weekends) are all about <i>Dragon</i> magazine. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>James Jacobs:</b>
 I'm just now starting design work on a book from Wizards that's still a
 bit down the road, along with a big adventure for the website. I've 
also got a big project brewing with Bastion Press that'll hopefully see 
the light of day by the end of the year or early 2004 (assuming I can 
finish it in time, of course!). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matthew Sernett:</b> By day I'm mild-mannered <i>Dragon</i>
 Magazine Associate Editor Matthew Sernett, but by night I am 
sleep-deprived, mole-eyed, keyboard-cramped Freelance Lad! I worked on <i>Fiend Folio</i> while I was writing <i>Plot &amp; Poison</i> for Green Ronin. After burning all that midnight oil, I wanted to take a break, but I was offered work on a <i>d20 Modern</i>
 book and decided that REM sleep wasn't really all that important. I 
just finished that book, and now I'm working on another book for Green 
Ronin that will come out around the time that Jesse's big one hits the 
shelves.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Eric Cagle:</b> At the moment, I'm writing several items for the Wizards website -- some Character Closeups, some Monster Mayhems, and another <i>d20 Modern</i>
 adventure. I've just begun work on a book for a new d20 company. It's 
still too early to divulge anything, other than it's going to be unlike<i> anything</i> you've seen before. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Erik Mona: </b><i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/polyhedron.shtml">Polyhedron</a></i>, </span><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">the
 magazine I edit, will be monthly by the time you read this. That's 
going to take up an enormous amount of time. We've got all sorts of 
stuff planned for the new version of the magazine, and I hope all of you
 run out and demand it from your local game or magazine stores (where 
they probably refer to it as <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dungeon.shtml">Dungeon</a>,</i> the crooks). Speaking of crooks, I'm working on a <i>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</i> supervillain catalog called <i>Crooks!</i>
 for Green Ronin Publishing. It's the latest project from Super Unicorn,
 my new design studio (with mates Sean Glenn, Kyle Hunter, and Rick 
Achberger), and should hit stores in the late spring.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Chris Thomasson:</b> Editing <i>Dungeon</i>
 takes most of my time. I'm working on a massive project in the magazine
 right now: a new Adventure Path series that launched with "Life's 
Bazaar" in issue #97. This has sort of become my life's obsession. I'm 
also writing <i>Bow &amp; Blade</i> with Jesse, and I try to write for <i>Dragon</i>
 whenever I can. I'm a lighter freelancer than most of these guys, 
because I've seen the dark circles under Matt's eyes. I like sleep.</span></p>
