<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b>Dragonlance<b> is one of </b>D&amp;D<b>'s
 most beloved and developed settings, with over a hundred novels and 
numerous game products, comic books, and other materials. In revising 
the setting for the new rules, how did you decide where to begin and 
which resources to use?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret Weis:</b> We wanted to begin with the beginning, which was <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/bio/tracyhickman">Tracy [Hickman]'s</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> original vision for <b>Dragonlance</b>. That made me the "keeper of the flame" when questions arose. I also worked with the book department editors and the other<b> Dragonlance</b>
 authors to incorporate their visions into the original. Tracy always 
said that Krynn was real to those who entered it and that we all saw the
 same things, just from different perspectives.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Don Perrin:</b> We had all worked with <b>Dragonlance</b>
 for so long that we were mostly familiar with what we needed before the
 project started. That was true in the macro sense, but in the micro 
sense, a lot of research had to be done. The phrase "God is in the 
details" was, for our point of view, a good reflection of what we had to
 do.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher Coyle: </b>For me, it began with re-reading every <b>Dragonlance</b>
 book I had ever read, and then diving in and reading everything that I 
hadn't. Within three months, I ended up reading more than 90 <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/dl/novelguide">Dragonlance</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/dl/novelguide"> novels</a>,
 which was a wealth of information to try to absorb. As the swiftest 
reader, and with pretty good recall, I focused particularly on those 
books that were hard to get a hold of. Luckily, I took copious notes! 
The novels were ranked based on their continuity, for example, working 
outward from the initial six novels by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlant/887780000">Chronicles</a> and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlgiftset/886100000">Legends</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">) for the core of the project, as their vision truly forms the heart of <b>Dragonlance</b>'s beginnings.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie Chambers:</b>
 While relying on Chris to help keep up with many different details, I 
tried to focus on the "big picture" of Krynn. The goal was to update <b>Dragonlance</b>
 to 3rd Edition, but we did not want to lose some of its special 
qualities that have kept the fans returning for nearly twenty years. I 
focused on the "core" qualities first demonstrated in the original six 
novels and <i><b>Dragonlance</b></i>adventures (for <b>AD&amp;D</b> 1st 
Edition). We all wanted to incorporate as many as possible of the novels
 and short stories -- some of which have never been reflected in game 
product -- into our line, but through the "lens" of our vision of <b>Dragonlance</b>,
 a vision we tried hard to match to that of Margaret Weis and Tracy 
Hickman. We assembled an impressive resource library, and our goal was 
to be inclusive. Careful readers will find many references throughout 
the text to stories both well-known and obscure.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 With so many different authors involved, there were bound to be minor 
continuity blips. How did you handle contradictory information?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher:</b> With so many talented writers involved in <b>Dragonlance</b>, each with his or her own vision of what <b>Dragonlance</b>
 was to them, there were some considerable contradictions that we needed
 to deal with. Since Margaret and Tracy's work formed the core, we used 
their novels as the basis from which to work. Jean Rabe's works, 
particularly the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlnovel/882100000">Dragons of a New Age</a> trilogy, were the voice of the Fifth Age, while <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/bio/RichardAKnaak">Richard Knaak's</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Legend of Huma</i> and <i>Kaz the Minotaur</i> and Chris Pierson's <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlnovel/886940000">Kingpriest Trilogy</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
 were the heart of the early Ages. We also incorporated much of the Lost
 Histories, the Elven Nations, and Dwarven Nations trilogies, and quite a
 few other novels all tied in together. Basically, where there was 
conflict, we looked for the ideal that was closest to being "<b>Dragonlance</b>."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie:</b>
 Judgment calls were required on occasion when some sources contradicted
 others, and we chose those that best reflected the core ethos and 
stories as originally envisioned. As with everything else in the book, 
Margaret was our final word.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret:</b>
 Continuity issues with Krynn never really bothered me all that much, 
although I know they drive the fans crazy! If you study history, you 
find that every event in the history of man is viewed differently by 
every person who was involved with it. These people told their stories 
to other people, who told still more people, embellishing as they went 
along. To my mind, the contradictions in Krynn's history cause it to 
resemble our real world just that much more closely.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 Where were the biggest gaps that needed to be filled? In other words, 
what new material did you generate for the updated campaign book?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher:</b><b>Dragonlance</b>
 has always had a pretty thorough timeline, which was a dream to work 
with. And with the wealth of novels, comics, and stories out there, we 
had plenty of material to draw upon. However, as the focus of the <i><b>Dragonlance</b> Campaign Setting</i> (DLCS) is to take the world forward, and the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlgiftset/179820000">War of Souls</a>
 trilogy ends six months before the "starting" time of the DLCS, we had 
to brainstorm and figure out where the world was heading. What was going
 on with the Orders of High Sorcery now that the moons of magic were 
back? What were the gods doing to regain their lost followers? What has 
been happening with the minotaurs in Silvanesti and the outcast elves? 
We talked with various authors whose work will be taking the world 
forward (such as Richard Knaak with his <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books/dl/knaakinterview">Minotaur Wars</a> trilogy, Jeff Crook and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlnovel/178780000">Dark Thane</a></i>, Mary Herbert with the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dlnovel/179760000">Linsha</a> trilogy</span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">,
 and of course Margaret and her Dark Disciple trilogy), and we laid the 
groundwork for the world to come. Some hints and clues hiding in the 
DLCS may remain hidden for a while, but once those novels are released, a
 lot will be made clearer. There is a slew of stuff in there, story 
seeds galore, that enterprising DMs will be able to spin into entire 
campaigns!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie:</b>
 In addition to writing huge sections of the book and being our content 
editor, Margaret served several other vital roles. She served as a 
liaison with the Wizards of the Coast book department to let us know 
what stories were currently in development. In addition, she also let us
 know what sorts of major events were in store for Ansalon and the tone 
the setting should have post-War of Souls.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even with all of the material already written for <b>Dragonlance</b>, there was still plenty of room for new ideas! For example, we knew we wanted to present the death knight as an important <b>Dragonlance</b> creature but we wanted to save Lord Soth for our <i>War of the Lance </i>sourcebook.
 The result was Lord Ausric, a new death knight who has an extremely 
cool story tied to the Chaos War and the ongoing legacy of the dark 
knights. Margaret and I had a lot of fun coming up with his story.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret</b>:
 Planning the future of Krynn was immense fun. In doing this, our goal 
was to provide adventurers and DMs with a future that is unknown, 
unexplored; a future in which heroes are needed, not a future where the 
heroes have solved all the problems! The War of Souls and the return of 
the gods have left Krynn in turmoil. While books are being written about
 this future, they will come out after the game material, so that 
players have the opportunity to create their own epic stories and to 
forge Krynn's future in their own imaginations.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards: What challenges did you encounter in bringing the </b>Dragonlance <b>setting
 up to 3rd Edition (v.3.5) standards? Did things like prestige classes 
make it easier or more difficult to better develop the world of Krynn?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher:</b> Third Edition truly seems custom-made for <b>Dragonlance</b>, particularly since we were marrying the original <b>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> rules for <b>Dragonlance</b> with the <b>Saga</b> system rules. Originally, the world of Krynn was crafted to fit the rules established by the <b>AD&amp;D</b>
 system, which had limitations, for example, on who could become 
wizards, on what weapons a wizard could wield, and how wizards learned 
and cast their spells. This became part of the inherent flavor of <b>Dragonlance</b>. As <b>Dragonlance</b> evolved into the <b>Saga</b> system, sorcerers and mystics were introduced, which fit nothing in <b>AD&amp;D</b> rules set. But 3rd Edition <b>D&amp;D</b> does have sorcerers -- heck, even the symbols used in published Wizards of the Coast 3rd Edition <b>D&amp;D</b>
 adventures (the dragon head for encounters, the arrow for traps, the 
shield for cities and walls) were originally introduced and used in the <b>Dragonlance</b><b>Saga</b> game! The customizable nature of 3rd Edition truly made it easy to bring <b>Dragonlance</b> back to <b>D&amp;D</b>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie:</b> Third Edition<b> D&amp;D</b>
 took some of the best aspects of the old rules, providing a strong 
foundation but leaving lots of flexibility. Prestige classes were 
perfect for organizations such as the Wizards of High Sorcery and 
knights both good and evil. In fact, <b>Dragonlance</b> is sort of a 
first in 3rd Edition because some of these organizations are either 
mandatory (i.e., Wizards of High Sorcery) or concepts that a player 
designs a character specifically for (in the case of the knighthoods).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret:</b>
 Since, happily, I know nothing about rules, I left this up to Chris and
 Jamie and our friends on the Whitestone Council, who were an immense 
help to us, as well as the game designers at Wizards of the Coast.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 Given all the myriad options this book offers players, each of you must
 find yourself favoring one class over another, one race over another, 
one geographical region over another. What are your favorites? If you 
were to join a campaign now, what would you play?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher:</b> The Wizards of High Sorcery have always been one of my favorite <b>Dragonlance</b>
 concepts. In our current playtest adventure right now (run by Jamie 
Chambers), I'm playing a young Solamnic who grew up on the legends of 
the knight Huma and his wizard companion, Magius. Fascinated by Magius, 
Aeryk (my character) believed that "true' magic would always return some
 day, but without the gods, he held this hope deep in his heart. His 
family sent him to squire, as all promising young Solamnic nobles do, 
but when Aeryk awoke to see the familiar moons of the gods of magic 
hanging once more in the sky, his dreams were realized. He ran away from
 home, seeking a master so that he could become a true Wizard of High 
Sorcery like his hero, Magius. The campaign is incredibly fun; I'm 
really enjoying playing a young Aeryk and I'm both dreading and eagerly 
anticipating my Test of High Sorcery in the not-too-distant future so 
that he can enter the Orders of High Sorcery.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie:</b>
 Since reading the completion of the War of Souls, I've really spent a 
lot of time thinking about the elves of Ansalon, who are currently 
dealing with catastrophic changes both individually and as a people. The
 idea of such a long-lived people having to adjust to such terrible 
change -- sudden tragedy -- really stuck with me. It has affected both 
the stories I'd like to tell in writing and in the campaign I'm 
currently running. We have one elven character who is so ashamed of her 
heritage that she has shorn her ears and denies that she is an elf at 
all!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret</b>:
 I'm interested in the power struggle that will take place among the 
gods. Who will rise to take over the place once held by the Queen of 
Darkness? How will this immortal battle affect the mortals who will, of 
necessity, become involved? I will be dealing with part of this in the 
new Dark Disciple series as I continue the story of Mina.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Don</b>:
 I'm a big fan of the draconians of Krynn. They are unique to the 
setting, and offer so much. They have a cool history, and they think 
like soldiers. I'd like to try a draconian noble sometime.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 What was the creative process like? Did one person serve as design 
lead, did you all work together on each part, did you divide the book 
into sections? How did you work as a design team?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher:</b> Each of us has our specialties and interests. Margaret took the lead, as she's one of the primary voices of <b>Dragonlance</b>,
 with Jamie as the lead designer. I got to work on the sections of the 
book that I had always wanted to, while they got to write and deal with 
the "official' stuff.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie:</b>
 Margaret placed the honor (and tremendous responsibility) of being the 
lead designer on me when the project first began. I wrote the initial 
outlines and assigned writing on both the <i><b>Dragonlance</b> Campaign Setting</i> and our first follow-up product,<a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.dragonlance.com/d20/ageofmortals.asp&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20030802a"><i>Age of Mortals</i></a>. </span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We
 broke up the writing fairly evenly; I would usually do a rewrite or 
edit and then send sections to Margaret (who checked and edited 
everything). For those curious, I wrote the adventure "The Sylvan Key" 
and Chris wrote "The Ghost Blade," both of which are included.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret</b>:
 I was the editor on the project, going over what had been written by 
Chris and Jamie and the other contributors, as well as writing some 
material myself. We talked daily and exchanged copious emails to make 
certain that all of us knew what everyone was doing, since changes in 
one section could lead to changes in another.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 So much detail has gone into building Krynn over the years that it 
would never all fit in a single book. What did you have to leave out of 
this initial core book that you would like to have included?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher:</b>
 All sorts of things just could not be forced to fit into the core book!
 From the gnome invention rules that I slaved over (and which resemble a
 gnome invention in themselves!) to very specific prestige classes, like
 the kender handler and the gnome master tinkerer (which, while cool and
 needed, were just too narrow in focus for the book), we had to decide 
to limit ourselves to what would have the widest applicability to 
players and DMs. Luckily, none of the work we've done has been wasted, 
as we have an ambitious schedule where we can truly delve into these in 
greater detail.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie:</b> The DLCS has only so many pages, and as a core product for the <b>Dragonlance</b>
 game line had to be very broad in scope. I personally would have loved 
to go into even more detail about the places and characters of Ansalon 
after the War of Souls -- but that's just the sort of thing our 
follow-up products will provide.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret</b>:
 Deciding what to leave out was probably the most difficult part for us.
 We would come up with something really cool and then realize that we 
had only a paragraph to talk about it, when it deserved a chapter! In a 
way, this helped shape much of our future product line. It was 
comforting to know that something we could talk about for only a 
paragraph in the DLCS will be given several pages in the <i>Towers of High Sorcery, </i>for example. So, if you want more detail than what you find in the DLCS, just wait. It will be forthcoming!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards: What additional books will support the </b>Dragonlance <b>setting?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher</b>:
 This year alone, there are quite a few great products in store. The one
 that I'm currently focused on is the adventure trilogy: <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.dragonlance.com/d20/keyofdestiny.asp&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20030802a">Key of Destiny</a></i>, </span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Specter of Sorrows</i>, and <i>Price of Courage</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie</b>: Our lineup just for this year includes a <a href="http://www.dragonlance.com/d20/dmscreen.asp">Dungeon Master's Screen</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> with a 32-page book of "plug-and-play" NPCs that might be typically met in a <b>Dragonlance</b> campaign, as well as an NPC progression chart for our mystic, mariner, and noble classes. <i>Key of Destiny</i> is the first of our Age of Mortals Campaign books, mega-adventures that will be linked to form a trilogy. The <i><a href="http://www.dragonlance.com/d20/bestiary.asp">Bestiary of Krynn</a></i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> comes up next, updating unique <b>Dragonlance</b>
 monsters to the revised 3rd Edition game -- plus detailing some 
creatures that have been seen only in novels and short stories. (One 
example is the Feeder from the short story "Dagger Flight.") January of 
next year sees the <i>Towers of High Sorcery</i> product, which is both a sourcebook on magic and on the mysterious Orders of High Sorcery, past, present, and future!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards: Finally, how will each of you be involved in future Dragonlance products? What else are you working on?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Christopher</b>: I think that we've discovered that when we work together, we create a nearly harmonious creative synergy. <b>Dragonlance</b>
 is a labor of love, it always has been, and I know that I have loved 
working on the very setting that first introduced me to gaming. 
Currently, I'm designing the adventure trilogy, as well as providing 
some writing support to Jamie as he forges ahead. I'm also the art 
director for Sovereign Press, so it's my job to come up with most of the
 image concepts for the artwork and find the artists we want to work on 
them. I hope to continue working on <b>Dragonlance</b> for some time to come.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jamie</b>: I will continue to serve as the lead manager and designer for the <b>Dragonlance</b> game line, working closely with Margaret, Chris, and our freelance writers to create the best products we can. <b>Dragonlance</b>
 has become fresh and exciting to me once again, both in games and 
novels, and I'm going to have fun both moving forward and exploring 
Krynn's past. I will, however, still be involved with Sovereign Stone 
and we are planning to create new game product based on Margaret's new 
Dragonvarld series from Tor Books. I'll be constantly busy, but that's 
the way I like it!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Don</b>:
 I will continue to work with Sovereign Press to provide layout and 
graphic design services, and serve as a contributing author on those 
projects that they wish me to work on. My current project is launching a
 new magazine,<i> Military Gamer,</i> for the historical miniature gaming market.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Margaret</b>: I'm working on the Dark Disciple trilogy, which will continue the story of Mina. I'm also working with other <b>Dragonlance</b> authors and book editors to shape Krynn's future, coordinating their ideas with those of the game designers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I want to say that it has been a pleasure for me to once again be involved in the game side of <b>Dragonlance</b>.
 The enthusiasm generated by the fans for this product has been truly 
gratifying. I want to thank all of those who were on that original 
design team, my own design team, and all those people -- authors, 
editors and designers -- who have given something of themselves to <b>Dragonlance</b>. I want to thank the fans, who have always been a major part of the <b>Dragonlance</b>
 world. (Yes, we do listen to you!) Finally, I want to thank Tracy 
Hickman, who first sat down in 1983 to create a new world, the world of <b>Dragonlance</b>. Tracy, this book's for you!</span></p>
