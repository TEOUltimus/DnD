 discuss roleplaying with and against the undead, Dick Clark's place in 
the undead universe, and the logic behind becoming a good lich.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: In your introduction to <i>Libris Mortis</i>,
 you mention that you researched a number of resources for information 
about the undead, including pop culture. Can you expand on the pop 
culture research you did? (Personally, I was grateful to see <i>The Night Stalker</i> in your appendix for inspirational reading and viewing.)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy Collins:</b> I think that Joss Whedon's <i>Buffy: The Vampire Slayer </i>and <i>Angel</i>
 series (both off the air but available on DVD) are crucial viewing for 
anyone looking to play an undead-heavy campaign, even if it's not set in
 the modern day. For dramatic campaigns, look to almost any (serious) 
movie version of <i>Dracula</i>, from Bela Lugosi's classic performance right up to the recent <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i>
 (particularly if you can ignore Keanu Reeves's presence). 
Action-oriented campaigns will probably get more use out of the recent <i>Mummy</i> and <i>Mummy Returns</i> flicks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce Cordell: </b>For my part, pop culture has less impact on my conceptualizations of the undead. Well, unless you count <i>The Evil Dead</i> and its many sequels. Oh, and perhaps <i>28 Days Later </i>(I know, not technically undead, but close enough). Does <i>Salem's Lot</i> count?--the book, not the movie. Even <i>Changeling</i>,
 for its dramatic hauntings and spooky sets, influenced my work on this 
book. Now I know that movie is too old to be considered part of pop 
culture.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Just out of curiosity, where would 
Frankenstein's monster fall on the chart? Was he even technically 
undead? And Dick Clark -- undead?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Technically, Frankenstein's monster is more flesh golem than undead, but Dick Clark is clearly a vampire.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce: </b>Frankenstein--reanimated body parts sewn 
into a dysfunctional whole. Marvelous! Dick Clark--preserved body parts 
slowly fading. Less satisfying.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Undead Religion stands out as an unusual 
chapter -- one might think that the undead are beyond the reach of 
religion. What is the most strikingly original take on undead religion 
in the book?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> In the <b>D&amp;D</b> multiverse, many 
undead are free-willed individuals, and as such, can pursue hopes and 
dreams, react to fears, and set goals. But beyond even that, there are 
those who yet draw breath who are drawn to the worship of death, either 
for personal power or because of an internal drive towards 
self-destruction.</p>
<p align="LEFT">My favorite undead god in the book is Evening Glory -- 
in a very twisted way, this perfectly preserved beauty represents 
undying love, physically untainted by years of life and living. Those 
who worship Evening Glory are lovestruck, who believe that the 
dissipations of age should not cause love's flame to die. Embrace the 
perfect preservation of undeath, her church teaches, and possesses love 
eternally.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The Character Options chapter allows players
 to play an undead character or add an undead familiar, cohort, or other
 companion to their adventuring group. You outline some of the 
advantages and disadvantages (like immunities but a lack of 
constitution). Describe your experiences playtesting this idea. How 
difficult is it to roleplay an undead character?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> The challenge of roleplaying an undead 
character really depends on the mood you're trying to accomplish. 
Everyone's familiar with the angst-ridden vampire, attempting to atone 
for his/his people's evil ways. But what about the character turned into
 a ghoul by actions beyond his control? Is he mad at the world? Does he 
go a little (or a lot) crazy because of his new condition? And then 
there's the character who's become a wight or mohrg for entirely 
"normal" reasons -- because he was a horrible person in life. Does he 
continue along the same path, or does he try to turn over a new leaf? 
And if </p>
<p align="LEFT">he does aim to repent, why is he doing it? Does he think
 that an eternal reward awaits him if he becomes a better person? Why or
 why not?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce: </b>I've played a character that was secretly undead, and this can work very well for a while. In many <b>D&amp;D</b>
 games, every character has a certain something special in their 
backgrounds, and being undead, and hiding that fact from your comrades, 
can be both fun and challenging. By the time they realize what your 
character truly represents, hopefully they can overcome their "life-ism"
 enough to not slay you out of hand.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The prestige classes and undead prestige 
classes are particularly interesting. Which ones do you think players 
will really gravitate toward? (The true necromancer is bound to continue
 as a much-played class!)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> I like the fact that there are a variety of
 prestige classes that offer benefits to the "hunter of undead," from 
the sacred purifier to the deathslayer. The pale master is a really 
creepy option available both to PCs and NPCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> Some of these prestige classes are updated from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882380000">Tome and Blood</a></i>, including the true necromancer and pale master (originally named the more alliterative "pale apprentice" in <i>Tome &amp; Blood</i>, but the name of which underwent a change prior to publication). These remain some of my favorites.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The book contains lots of new spells, 
alchemical substances, positoxins, magic items, and wondrous items, and 
the idea of an undead graft is awesome -- I imagine that getting 
vampiric fangs grafted on will be hugely popular. What are your 
favorites among the new spells and items?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> I like the new alchemical substances (some of which made their first appearance in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizopublishing.com&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20041001a">Dragon</a></i>
 magazine) and the positoxins -- poison-like substances designed for use
 against undead creatures -- because they allow any character to carry 
some effective anti-undead tools. They also work well in low-fantasy 
campaigns, where access to powerful spells or magic items might not be 
as common.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> What's not to like about force-growing a 
sentient undead tumor in the body of your enemy, then using that mass to
 influence your enemy, or kill him, as you desire? Well, okay, it <i>is</i> pretty gross, but if you're going to make a grade-one necromancer, you can't let squeamishness stand in your way!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The new monsters are particularly 
horrifying. The angel of decay seems like doom just waiting to descend 
on a party, and you really can't go wrong with a monster called "brain 
in a jar." In your opinions as both gamers and designers, what are the 
monsters in <i>Libris Mortis</i> for parties to watch out for?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> I get shivers every time I think about 
fighting a corpse rat swarm. I mean, as bad as it would be to be covered
 in rats, imagine if they were rotting?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce</b>: While tomb motes may initially seem 
inconsequential, get enough of them together, and you've got trouble. 
The same goes for the slay mate -- alone, it won't prove too much 
trouble, but teamed up with a necromancer, the slay mate magnifies its 
master's power. Likewise, the forsaken shell (the animated skin from an 
unfortunate humanoid) may not seem too scary at first, until it wraps 
around its victims and squeezes their life from them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: I read and reread the idea of the lich variant "good lich." So, I guess the interview question here is . . . really? A <i>good</i> lich??</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> While most of us would shudder to think 
about transforming our bodies in such a manner, in a truly fantastic 
world I don't find it so much of a stretch to imagine the possibility of
 deciding, "Yes, it's worth giving up my physical health and vitality in
 order to live forever" without having to also be a megalomaniac or mass
 murderer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> I guess it all depends on how well 
preserved you can convince yourself that you'll end up being. Wait, I 
mean your character. Anyway . . . preservation on par with a vampire -- 
that doesn't seem too bad. But flesh dropping from your bones with each 
movement . . . well, now it's hard to stay good when you've got that 
sort of nuisance to deal with.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: What did you have to leave out of this 
volume? Are there plans for future adventures or books centered around 
some of the concepts from <i>Libris Mortis</i>?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> I didn't intentionally leave any topics out of the book -- if it felt worth writing about, I found a place for it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> We tried to fill this book with as much 
undeathly coolness as possible. But that being said, there are many more
 cool interactions of undeath and game mechanics still available to play
 with. <i>Libris Mortis</i> is a fabulous book, but of course it is only a single volume.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: What are you working on now?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> As a member of the RPG development team, I work on most of the core <b>D&amp;D </b>products on the schedule. My recent development projects have included <i>Complete Adventurer</i>, <i>Races of Destiny</i>, and <i>Races of the Wild</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce</b>: I've got a few things on my plate -- in 
fact, I'm finalizing something that I was designing last time I was 
interviewed, so I'll give you the same answer (since it doesn't yet 
appear in any catalogs): I'm working on a book that every player will 
want because it focuses on those things for which every player peers 
through the back of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">Dungeon Master's Guide</a></i> and that every player character covets, longs for, and slavers over while adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Finally . . . what do you suppose is served at the average undead Christmas office party?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce: </b>Undead Christmas office party? Well, the 
ghouls are happy with any old rotting limb, but more refined undead 
might find that candied fingers, blood pudding, and headcheese are just 
the thing for preserving holiday cheer.</p>
