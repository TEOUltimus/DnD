<p align="left"><b>Wizards: A title like <i>Heroes of Horror</i> is enough to strike fear into the hearts of players. But exactly how does this book handle the mechanics for fear?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2005%20-%2010-10%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Horror_files/dx1009ps_heroesofhorrorspotlight_3.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="298" width="222">James Wyatt:</b> The sad reality of the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game is that fear is, mechanically speaking, not very interesting. In 
the rules as they stand, a character experiencing fear is either mildly 
inconvenienced (shaken) or out of the fight (frightened or panicked). So
 we offered a set of mechanical additions collectively known as dread 
rules that should make the game experience of fear more interesting. 
These rules essentially describe ways of using other conditions that 
exist in the game to model characters' responses to horrific 
occurrences. For example, characters who suddenly face scenes or 
creatures of utter horror might become dazed, stunned, or even 
paralyzed. Likewise, characters might become fatigued after a 
particularly horrible encounter and exhausted after a series of them. 
Scenes of horror can transfix characters, commanding their complete 
attention and shutting out any other sensory information, thus rendering
 them fascinated or even confused. We give concrete examples (with save 
DCs) for each of these ideas and more, as well as a few ways to use them
 in place of existing game effects, such as a mummy's despair ability or
 a devil's aura of fear.</p>
<p align="left">As an optional rule, the book also includes a variant 
description of the frightened condition. This version is simply a more 
extreme form of the shaken condition that doesn't make the character run
 away. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Does <i>Heroes of Horror</i> provide advice for creating frightening experiences -- not just for the characters in the game, but for the players as well?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW: </b>Beyond the mechanics, the book is full of 
excellent advice (mostly written by my co-authors, Ari Marmell and C.A. 
Suleiman, who know a thing or two about running horror games) for 
building encounters, adventures, and campaigns that will strike fear 
into the hearts of your players. And that's really a lot more fun than 
forcing characters to run away from scary monsters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What about those goody-goody paladins -- 
does the book offer effective means to circumvent their pesky immunity 
to fear and give 'em a good case of the willies?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> Actually, <i>Heroes of Horror </i>outlines 
two ways to achieve that result. One is to use the dread mechanics 
mentioned above. Because these aren't necessarily fear effects, the 
paladin's immunity to fear doesn't always apply. The book also presents a
 prestige class with a special ability that lets him cast fear spells 
that affect even creatures immune to fear.</p>
<p align="left">On the flip side, a paladin's immunity to fear helps to 
make her special, and I don't think it would be good for the game if the
 DM regularly went to great lengths to get around it. The paladin still 
has plenty to worry about in a horror campaign -- including the 
possibility that she may be the only one left to face the monster when 
the rest of the party has run away (or is staring transfixed) in fear!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: On that note, what about high-level 
characters who've grown so powerful that they're no longer afraid of the
 boogeyman? What does <i>Heroes of Horror</i> offer to send them 
straight back to their 1st-level memories of jumping at shadows? Does it
 offer advice on running high-level characters through horror settings? 
Some might argue that a horror-based storyline traditionally relies upon
 the inherent weakness of the protagonists, and their vulnerabilities, 
to generate some of the fear?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> It's not just horror games. Part of what makes the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game exciting is the possibility that the PCs might lose an encounter 
-- even if "losing" is just a temporary setback. The possibility of 
losing involves some recognition of the characters' vulnerabilities, no 
matter how high-level those characters are. </p>
<p align="left">In designing this book, however, we took a deliberate 
step away from Gothic horror, with its virginal heroines and everyman 
heroes, toward a flavor of horror that I think fits better in the <b>D&amp;D</b> world, with its superheroic characters. Influenced more by Clark Ashton Smith than Bram Stoker, <i>Heroes of Horror</i>
 threatens characters with the possibility that the evil they fight 
might corrupt them -- not just by luring them into evil deeds, but also 
by eating away their flesh or devouring their souls. Thus, even 
high-level characters have plenty to fear from this book.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Aside from fear, what other mechanics are 
introduced? Does the book include sanity checks, or strange and horrific
 elements that impose curses and diseases? (In previous editions, for 
example, ghosts made characters age supernaturally, and rot grubs ate 
people from the inside out.)</b></p>
<p align="left"><i><img src="2005%20-%2010-10%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Horror_files/dx1009ps_heroesofhorrorspotlight_2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="211" width="273"></i><b>JW:</b> The most significant mechanical element detailed in this book is taint. Originally introduced in <i>Oriental Adventures</i> and modified for a more general audience in <i>Unearthed Arcana,</i> taint is a mechanic that seamlessly blends horror with the high-fantasy world of <b>D&amp;D.</b>
 We revised and expanded the taint mechanic significantly, into its most
 robust incarnation yet, then used it to define a genre that's distinct 
from what's been done in <b>D&amp;D</b> (and <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>) before.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Unearthed Arcana</i> also picked up the sanity system from <i>Call of Cthulhu,</i> but I didn't include it in this book because I felt that that it didn't fit well with the medieval fantasy setting of the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 world. First of all, the sanity system reflects a particularly modern 
style of horror in which the terror stems from effects that break the 
laws of reality as defined by scientific knowledge -- knowledge that 
doesn't exist or doesn't apply in <b>D&amp;D.</b> Second, using sanity rules in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game means cluttering your medieval fantasy with such words as 
dissociative disorders and obsessive/compulsive behavior, which just 
feel out of place.</p>
<p align="left">Fundamentally, the difference between <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> horror and fantasy horror comes down to a single point. In <i>Call of Cthulhu,</i>
 innocent people who are exposed to horrors beyond the realm of human 
experience go insane -- either slowly or rapidly. In fantasy, evil 
people are often mad, and mad people are always tainted by evil. No, 
that definition doesn't square with our modern understanding of mental 
illness as a disease that affects people whether they deserve it or not,
 but it's true to the tropes of fantasy that portray madness as an 
expression or a result of evil gnawing away at the mind and soul.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Unholy Scion</b></p>
<p align="left">Not every birth resulting from the mating of an evil 
outsider and a mortal produces a half-fiend. If the female partner in 
such a union is impregnated in an area of high taint, the result is an 
unholy scion. Such a creature can also be created when a fiend mentally 
possess an unborn child within the womb. In either</p>
<p align="left">case, the unholy scion has fiendish power and malignance
 that are all the more terrifying because of its ability to pass as 
mortal.</p>
<p align="left">An unholy scion looks like a normal member of its mortal
 parent's race, but it is subtly disturbing. Its features might be ever 
so slightly off, its eyes may seem to have an evil gleam, or it might 
simply make everyone around it nervous for no obvious cause. The 
overwhelming majority of unholy scions are humanoid, although animal 
scions are not unheard of.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What about the older edition's portrayal of baby hags bursting out of their humanoid host mothers like xenomorphs from <i>Aliens?</i></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> Baby hags? Well, check out the unholy scion template, below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: And what about the nightmarish element of dreams?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> The book includes an excellent section on 
dreams and nightmares. (Ari wrote it, so I have no hesitation in saying 
it's excellent.) His tips on how to make dream-events seem real but 
somehow wrong are really, really good stuff.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Does <i>Heroes of Horror</i> promote its own setting (akin to <i>Ravenloft</i>),
 or can elements of it be used in any campaign world? Can you share any 
details of how horror might be specifically placed in the <i>Forgotten Realms</i> or <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> I think this aspect of the Genre Series (which includes <i>Heroes of Battle</i> as well as this book) is really cool. While I was working on this book, David Noonan was running an <b>Eberron</b> campaign set during the Last War that made extensive use of <i>Heroes of Battle.</i> Meanwhile, I was running an <b>Eberron</b> campaign in which I made use of the mechanics I was writing for <i>Heroes of Horror.</i> Both campaigns used the same setting, but they were different genres.</p>
<p align="left">So no, <i>Heroes of Horror</i> doesn't present a setting
 -- defined or implied. It is explicitly designed to be usable in any 
setting. We devote about a page and a half of the book to ideas for 
integrating <i>Heroes of Horror </i>into the <i><b>Forgotten Realms, Eberron,</b></i>and <i><b>Greyhawk</b> Campaign Settings,</i>
 using specific elements of those three worlds as launching points for 
horror campaigns. The rest of the book, however, is just as useful no 
matter what setting you're using.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Does <i>Heroes of Horror</i> offer any good 
and spooky NPC villains for the PCs to encounter? Some would claim that 
NPCs are 50% of a great horror adventure!</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2005%20-%2010-10%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Horror_files/dx1009ps_heroesofhorrorspotlight_1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="176" width="243">JW:</b> Of course it does!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: The other 50% of a great adventure would have to be creatures! Does <i>Heroes of Horror</i> focus on vampires and feature any new rules or effects that cover vampirism and/or lycanthropy?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b><i>Heroes of Horror</i> does not focus on any 
particular kind of monster. A nice five-page section at the start of the
 monster chapter discusses the classic gothic monsters and their role in
 a horror-themed <b>D&amp;D</b> game, then goes on to discuss existing monsters by creature type before launching into new monsters. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Do you have any favorite monsters from the book? Did any of them keep you up at night, in a cold sweat? </b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW: </b>I'm particularly fond of the corruption 
eater, though I confess to no cold sweats. I do have a story I just have
 to share, though. One morning a couple of years ago, my wife told me 
about a nightmare she'd had the night before, which involved a spider 
attaching itself to her. She still gives me a hard time about the fact 
that my completely unsympathetic response was, "Oh cool!" That nightmare
 eventually took form as the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/ff_gallery/50154.jpg">soul tick</a> on page 220 of the <i>Fiend Folio.</i></p>

<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What sorts of diabolic magic might players 
(and their foes) now have access to? Personally, I loved the 
implications of the quote, "In a horror campaign, resurrection doesn't 
always summon the soul it's meant to."</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b><i> Heroes of Horror</i> features two new 
standard classes, both of which are spellcasters. The archivist is a 
divine caster with a spellbook, while the dread necromancer is a new 
take on an old specialist. The dread witch and tainted scholar prestige 
classes offer some new magical capabilities as well. More than two dozen
 spells (including <i>cloak of hate, mantle of pure spite, rigor mortis, </i>and <i>vile death</i>) round out the "diabolic magic" in the book.</p>
<p align="left">The quote about resurrection actually appears in the 
campaigns chapter, in a section on death and resurrection. One of my 
players should tell you about his warforged character who got raised and
 became the villain for the next several sessions of the adventure.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What sorts of dark locations does the book provide for trembling parties to explore?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> In addition to several cool maps just thrown 
in for your adventuring enjoyment, the book offers a pretty extensive 
section on horror environments such as tainted locations, dread effects 
(including blood rock, for you <i><b>D&amp;D</b> Miniatures</i> fans), 
haunting presences, and mortuary terrain. (You always wanted to know how
 much cover a gravestone gives, right?) In addition, some brief 
adventure seeds can take your PCs to desperate villages and a lich's 
shrine, plus a couple of sites linked to the prestige classes and 
monsters in the book.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: As a horror-themed book, is <i>Heroes of Horror</i> aimed at a mature audience, along the lines of <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> The book is not intended for the squeamish. 
However, it does not carry a warning sticker, and it's not intentionally
 provocative.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Was the book influenced at all by <i>Call of Cthulu</i>/Lovecraft or <i>Ravenloft</i>? Does it have any atmospheric influence from movies or the Brothers Grimm fairy tales?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JW:</b> I've already discussed why I didn't include sanity rules. Though I've been a big <i>Ravenloft</i> (and <i>Masque of the Red Death</i>)
 fan, I tried very hard to steer this book in a different direction. Of 
course, every horror movie I've ever seen had its influence on the book,
 but the short stories of Clark Ashton Smith probably had the greatest 
influence on the way I defined the genre for the purpose of <i>Heroes of Horror. </i></p>
