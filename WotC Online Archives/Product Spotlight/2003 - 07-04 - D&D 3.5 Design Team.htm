 this month's exclusive and all-encompassing interview, the entire crew 
-- designers, developers, managers, and editors -- of the updated <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/175240000">Player's Handbook</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177520000">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, </i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">Monster Manual</a></i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> discuss the trials and tribulations of making the greatest roleplaying game on earth greater still.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Playing by the Rules</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><img src="2003%20-%2007-04%20-%20D&amp;D%203.5%20Design%20Team_files/ph35med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="193" width="150">The Player's Handbook</i> is the core of <b>D&amp;D</b> for everyone involved in the game, and the team went to great lengths to strengthen this most useful of tools. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS
 OF THE COAST: More feats, more spells, and new class features for six 
different classes. . . . How radical are the changes? Can you outline a 
couple that players might find pleasantly surprising? </b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip Williams:</b>
 I think they range from the almost invisible (unless it affects your 
character directly) to the pretty radical. Almost invisible: Racial 
weapon proficiencies have now been tweaked so that not everyone gets a 
pile of proficiencies they'll never use, but racial exotic weapons are 
much easier to use. Pretty radical: Big changes to rangers and monks. 
Monk players will be pleasantly surprised, as will ranger players, I 
think.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy Collins:</b>
 Well, I don't think I'd call any of the changes "radical." Even though 
some characters will undergo some significant changes, the aim is for 
the character to still feel like the same character, only with more 
interesting and balanced options. As Skip says, of all the changes, the 
revised ranger class probably contains the most dramatic changes, but 
anyone looking at the revised ranger will instantly recognize the class.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I
 think that players will be pleasantly surprised by how many more 
options are available for various character types. Specialist wizards 
will see more interesting choices; bards, monks, and rangers are more 
versatile; bards and druids have more magical options; fighters have 
more feats to choose from, and so forth.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ed Stark:</b> One change to the ranger class dovetails nicely with what Skip and Andy have already said. <b>D&amp;D</b>
 is about options, and the updated ranger class now has more. Instead of
 being tied exclusively to a two-weapon fighting track, the player of 
the ranger can also devote class abilities to becoming a better archer. 
This goes along well with the ranger's increase in skill options and 
class abilities that better reflect the ranger's role as a hunter and 
tracker in the game. Players decide how their rangers finally respond 
when they track down their quarries.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: How did you collect the data you needed to decide where to focus revisions?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy:</b> Data was "collected" through the experiences of R&amp;D and the development team in their own games, through interactions with <b>D&amp;D</b> players online, via email, and at conventions, and through playtesting. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ed:</b> I cannot overstate how much of an impact the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=rpga">RPGA</a></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
 membership had on the revision project. They are like a large group of 
continuous playtesters. They run events constantly and we received a lot
 of feedback through the RPGA's leadership. Their comments really helped
 us upgrade the game in such a way that <i>anyone</i> can play by the same rules, not relying on individual DMs to guess what the game designers were thinking.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>WIZARDS: Was the temptation there to simply overhaul the whole thing?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b> The temptation to overhaul everything was huge, and it had to be fought every step of the way.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy: </b>It's
 our job to write rules, so of course the temptation existed to "do 
more," but I don't think anybody ever seriously suggested overhauling 
the entire system. Not only was there no real business reason to do so, 
but even more than that it just didn't need it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: How vital is it for players to use this revised version if they have the 2000 release?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip: </b>Frankly,
 two players could sit down at the game table with different versions of
 the books and play for hours without knowing they weren't using the 
same rules.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy: </b>I think the revised core rules represent the best version of <b>D&amp;D</b> to date, so I guess anyone who's interested in the best <b>D&amp;D</b>
 experience available should see these books as "vital" for their game. 
Obviously, following products will rely on these books as well, so 
players looking to enjoy such products to their fullest extent will want
 the revised rulebooks on their shelves.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: Given more time, would you have made more changes? </b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Kim Mohan:</b>
 Well, sure. As they say in the game business, no game is ever finished;
 it's just published. If we had been allowed to keep the books in 
R&amp;D indefinitely, we could always find more and more small ways to 
improve the game . . . but then the books would never get printed. I'm 
extremely happy with how clean and well organized these books are.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy: </b>As
 Kim said, it's almost inevitable that more time would have equaled more
 changes. I've heard it said about writing books that a book's never 
done, it's just taken away from the writer. Designing RPGs is pretty 
similar -- at some point, they make you stop writing, and that means 
you're done.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b>
 Overall, I'm pretty happy with the level of change. There were a few 
ideas that weren't quite ripe, but you'll see some of those in <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20030704a">Dragon</a></i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> magazine in time.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>WIZARDS: Were there any cuts that were difficult to make?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Kim: </b>Assuming that you started with a piece of text in which every word was necessary, <i>any</i> cut would be difficult to make. But in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>,
 to the best of my recollection, we didn't have to sacrifice any major 
body of information to make room for something else. Of the three books,
 the <i>Player's Handbook</i> is the most similar structurally to its 
predecessor, so we didn't have too many hard decisions to make about 
what information got in the book and what didn't.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy:</b> The toughest cuts for me were two brand-new systems that I sketched up for addition to the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 One was a new metamagic system, and the second was a new item creation 
system. But since both of them represented pretty significant changes to
 those rule subsets, they would have required both more testing than we 
could provide and would have had a greater ripple effect on other books 
than we were really comfortable with. Rest assured, though, these 
systems aren't lost, and more than likely will find their way into 
publication sooner or later.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: What are the most functionally useful revisions for players?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Andy:</b>
 Revisions to the Spells chapter. Whether you're the caster or merely 
the target, spells affect every character in the game, and the revisions
 to this chapter will thus impact a wide range of characters.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Mastering the Game</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2007-04%20-%20D&amp;D%203.5%20Design%20Team_files/dmg35med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="193" width="150">More than the other two books, the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 underwent intense reorganization. After all, this is the book that 
makes the campaign world go round. Everything from encounter tables to 
the magic item creation rules and movement rules received detailed 
attention from the designers and editors.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: What's the most dramatic change that a long-time DM will immediately notice?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Redman:</b>
 I think the most immediate, obvious, and dramatic change is the 
reorganization. When the 3rd Edition books came out, the adventure game 
was supposed to teach you about<b> D&amp;D</b> (including both playing 
and DMing) and the adventure path modules were supposed to help you 
learn more about DMing. That meant that the <i>DMG</i> could be, more or
 less, a catalogue or encyclopedia of rules information, a reference 
book for DMs. With the demise of the adventure game (which had stopped 
printing long before we started on 3.5), we needed to focus the 3.5 
books much more on introducing the game to players. That meant 
reorganizing the <i>DMG</i> in particular. Several years of published books that referred to pages and chapters in the <i>DMG</i> meant we could only reorganize so much, but the copies I've seen stayed pretty close to the way I reorganized it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b>
 That complete reorganization of the chapters is in keeping with the 
book's new mission as a DM's toolbox for handling the unusual (as we 
know the unusual occurs pretty often in the <b>D&amp;D </b>game), rather than a general guide to DMing. It's much more like the first <i>DMG</i> for the <b>AD&amp;D</b> game.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>David Noonan:</b>
 There's a bit of a learning curve for experienced players, but the book
 should be much easier on newer players, and organized to keep the 
at-the-table page flipping under control. Chapter 1 is "How to be a DM,"
 and Chapter 2 covers all the rules stuff you need during the game -- 
everything from the first encounter to handing out experience. Chapters 3
 to 5 are "away from the gaming table" chapters that cover adventure 
design, campaign management, and so on. And realistically, most players 
reference the <i>DMG</i> periodically, so Chapters 6 and 7 are for them. Then at the back we've got a big quick-reference section.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nobody had to do more relearning than me. I was fond of quoting page numbers at my players: "The flight chart? <i>DMG</i> page 69. Grapple rules? <i>Player's Handbook</i>, page 137." They're all on different pages now, of course, and I have some memorizing ahead of me. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn Kestrel:</b>
 DMs will find more useful details. We provide a lot more help for a 
beginning DM and many more options for an experienced one. For instance,
 the<i> Dungeon Master's Guide</i> now includes basic information on 
terrain, everything from different types of dungeon doors to details on 
marsh terrain; a primer on the planes; a wider representation of 
prestige classes; information on traps, how to price time and how to set
 their CR; and more guidelines on pricing magic items, including 
intelligent ones.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To
 me the biggest change was the continuation of the shift to three 
dimensions. The templates for spells, dungeon features, and space/reach 
all help make the game more vibrant.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Kim</b>: And size does matter! The 3.5 <i>DMG</i>
 is 64 pages longer than its predecessor, and the new book has fewer 
illustrations than the previous one, which means this book has a lot of 
new information in it!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: Was this a front-to-back revision? Where do you even begin to revise something as massive as the <i>DMG</i>? And how much of this revision is based on player/customer feedback (versus, say, internal playtesting)?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Redman:</b> A lot of <i>DMG</i>
 revision was based on our experiences with the game, and please 
remember that we not only play this game, we play it with people besides
 each other. My regular <b>D&amp;D</b> group has only two game designers
 in it. So, our experiences are broad, and reflect both internal and 
external feedback. I thought the two major areas for revision in the <i>DMG</i>
 were obvious: Magic items and organization. Skip, Andy, and I spent 
months going through the Magic Items chapter arguing (literally) over 
how items should be priced and how we could convey that to the DM.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b>
 Once the shift in focus was in place, the rest was fairly 
straightforward. Pretty much the entire revision effort (not just the <i>DMG</i> effort) was driven by player feedback.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>David:</b>
 It's a front-to-back revision in the sense that we revised pretty much 
everything in it. But we didn't do it in exact front-to-back order, and 
we shuffled the order around. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 for where we began, we started with the things we knew we wanted to 
leave intact. And first on that list was Monte Cook's vision of the DM 
as the person who's having the most fun at the gaming table. Monte, who 
wrote a lot of the 3.0 <i>DMG</i>, has a keen insight into both the 
concrete details of work behind the DM's screen and the larger notion of
 good Dungeon Mastering as something worth aspiring to. If that "DMing 
is the best gig in gaming" sense remains in the revised books, we've 
done our jobs.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Rich
 Redman did a lot of the original thinking about how to reorganize the 
book so it'd be easier to reference, and his "blueprint for the blue 
book" guided a lot of our later work. We had a long list of "things to 
check" based on our own campaigns, notes from our customer service 
department, feedback from the RPGA. And we learned from more unusual 
sources, like the people responsible for translating the <i>DMG</i> into
 other languages. When you have to translate technical rules text mixed 
with fanciful and sometimes made-up language, you tend to ask a lot of 
very astute questions. Obviously, translators have a strong appreciation
 for precise language.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn</b>:
 We knew that we'd be adding many sections in response to customer 
feedback. Some of these would be condensed versions of material 
published in other books, others would be new. Rich Redman began the 
Herculean task of repricing magic items. David Noonan continued the fine
 work of heading up the<i> DMG</i> revision, including adding all the 
wonderful planar and terrain sections, and more than a few of the new 
prestige classes. Jennifer Clarke Wilkes tackled the bulk of the NPC 
chapter, updating the format to be more user-friendly and updating the 
statistics to be accurate. I pitched in with expanded text on cohorts, 
magic item pricing, magic item auras, and some work on the prestige 
classes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ed:</b>
 When the game designers sat down and worked on "3E," the intention was 
to design the game holistically, rather than front-to-back. 
Unfortunately, books have to get written, and some elements of the game 
(one example being individual spell descriptions) received less 
attention than others. The game worked as a whole much better than it 
had in the past, but there could be confusion between books.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I
 hope that with version 3.5 we've cut down on the confusion between 
books substantially. The revisions were addressed as a whole. If 
something in the <i>DMG</i> had to change, we stepped up and looked over both the<i> Player's Handbook</i>, and the <i>MM</i>
 -- and quite a bit of our support product -- and examined the change 
for impact. Andy mentioned earlier that we chose not to make some 
changes because of time considerations; if we couldn't justify a change 
throughout the whole system, we did not make it in just one single 
place.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: One would imagine that the revisions to the <i>DMG</i>
 are the hardest to playtest, as they'd require precise circumstances in
 the game to try them out (as opposed to rolling a combat against an 
updated <i>MM</i> entry). So how do you know that you got them right?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Redman:</b>
 You generally don't playtest them, with the exception of the combat 
chapter, which you playtest with unrevised monsters to reduce variables 
and check to see if you create more strangeness than you reduce. 
Instead, you check your math. The <i>DMG</i> has a lot of math in it (treasure tables, for instance).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>David:</b>
 Exactly. And fortunately, a lot of the more rules-intensive parts of 
the book cover aspects of game design that we've hashed over many times 
before: magic items and prestige classes. We've got a decent sense of 
how the <b>D&amp;D</b> economy works, and we've got good -- and fun -- playtesting techniques for prestige classes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 more esoteric rules, we've really benefited from the three years 
everyone's been playing the game. Even with the smallest rules, we could
 look at a situation and say, "How have people been handling it?" Take a
 staircase, for example. Most adventurers run up and down them without a
 second thought. But what if the bad guys try to push you off the 
stairs? There's a balustrade there -- does it save you?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 answer is "It certainly helps," and you'll find that you get a bonus on
 the opposed bull rush check in such a case. We looked through a lot of 
adventures -- everything from our published adventures to fragmentary 
notes from last Thursday's game at home for situations like that. When 
we found a particularly good way of handling a given situation, we tried
 to find a place for it in the <i>DMG</i> if it was something that would
 occur in other people's games too. Then we tested. In the above case, 
we tested by repeatedly pushing Tordek off the stairs. (All our playtest
 characters put up with a great deal of abuse.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> Additionally, we strove to make the <i>DMG</i>
 user-friendly on many levels. How do I know it works? I see my DM smile
 more and frown less. For instance, I play in a campaign run by Julia 
Martin. Now, when a player casts<i> detect magic</i> or looks at something through a<i> gem of seeing</i>
 and asks the omnipresent questions, "Is it magic? What's the school and
 strength?", Julia doesn't have to juggle books and flip back and forth 
between the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i>DMG</i>. She simply tells us the magic item's aura and strength without turning a page.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ed:</b> I also like to think the <i>DMG</i> had perhaps the most "pre-playtesting." Since there are a lot of individual elements in the <i>DMG</i>
 (particularly the magic items section), it was easy for our players and
 DMs to send us comments on 3.0 that we were able to examine and 
integrate into 3.5. If we received consistent feedback that a magic item
 was, oh, underpowered or overpriced, we could look at that specific 
item and make an evaluation based on a lot of peoples' experiences.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b> So basically, there's nothing in the <i>DMG</i> that hasn't been discussed, run through our local campaigns, and discussed again. I'd say we got it right.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Manhandling the Monsters </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2007-04%20-%20D&amp;D%203.5%20Design%20Team_files/mm35med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="193" width="150">Random encounter, predetermined guardian, or summoned servant, the monsters of <b>D&amp;D</b> make all those combat rules worth exploring. The revised <i>Monster Manual</i>
 presented the team with some of its greatest challenges simply by 
virtue of the astonishing number of monsters out there just waiting to 
be encountered.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: What was the hardest part about revising the <i>Monster Manual</i>?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Baker:</b>
 The hardest part of the job was probably the sheer volume of the work 
we needed to do. There are hundreds of monster entries, and each monster
 has a couple dozen data points to examine and check. We tried to look 
at each entry for each monster and ask ourselves, "Does this say the 
right thing? Is this the way it should work?"</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn:</b>
 The three core books are independent, but they're also one harmonious 
unit. We had to be very sensitive to and educated about the changes in 
both the<i> Player's Handbook</i> and the<i> Dungeon Master's Guide.</i> Consider how the revisions to spells in the<i> Player's Handbook</i>, changed spells and spell lists in the<i> MM</i>. Likewise, we had to envision how changes in the<i> Monster Manual</i>
 would impact the other books. Changes to the environment entries 
created changes to the random encounter tables. Changes to vermin poison
 had to be checked against the<i> DMG</i> poison entries and traps. In 
addition, Rich Baker unified the skill points and feats with how 
characters get them. A wonderful revision, but the changes affected 
every nearly every monster.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jennifer Clarke Wilkes:</b>
 For me, the hardest part, but also the most challenging and 
interesting, was retrofitting the animals and vermin (and assorted other
 critters) to the new skill and feat array. This often ended up 
producing more racial bonuses or special qualities.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: Did you feel compelled to tinker with power levels or attack damage to shore up or weaken a monster?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Baker: </b>We
 did choose to tinker with the power levels of a number of monsters, 
almost always to make them tougher. Many of the creatures in the 3rd 
Edition <i>Monster Manual</i> were more or less direct conversions from 
2nd Edition. So, the 3rd Edition mummy was AC 17 because the 2nd Edition
 mummy had been AC 3. When we were building 3E, that was a perfectly 
reasonable starting point. But now that we have three years of 
observable results on how our 3E monsters play, we simply know more 
about where monsters ought to be pegged in terms of power level.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b>
 As a general rule, we started by looking at Challenge Ratings and 
finding mismatches. Then we decided to change the CR or change the 
creature depending on what felt right for the monster. We did some of 
each. We tended to avoid big changes in CRs, though.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jennifer:</b> I did some of the powered-up versions of various monsters. I'm happiest about the half-elf monk/shadowdancer elite vampire.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: What changes will players find the most noticeable?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Baker: </b>The
 organization is a significant one. We took many common definitions that
 occurred over and over again in our monster entries and moved them to a
 glossary. We broke up many of the "gang" entries that sometimes 
separated a monster description from its statistics block by several 
pages, so it should be easier to navigate. And we added high-powered 
versions of a number of favorite monsters to provide the DM with more 
high-CR opponents for his game.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jennifer: </b>I
 think putting the single attack, grapple, and full attack bonuses right
 out there in the stat blocks will make monsters much easier to run 
"straight out of the book."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS:
 What feedback from players and DMs did you receive prior to beginning 
revision that helped you identify problem areas? Had much come up from 
internal playtesting or campaigns that gave you additional insight? </b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b>
 When you collect a dozen or so letters that ask, "Is this CR right?" 
you can be pretty sure there's a problem. Likewise, you look for "How 
does this work, really?" questions.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Baker:</b>
 We've accumulated three years of player observation (as well as 
incessant play experience in our own personal campaigns) on which 
monsters were on-target or off-target in terms of CR. Many of our 
organizational changes stem from player feedback. For example, every 
monster entry now includes a Base Attack/Grapple line that provides 
those numbers for the monster. That's information our players requested,
 because it was darned difficult to know just how much Power Attack a 
minotaur could really use, or what the die modifier is when your monk 
decides to grab the medusa and stuff her head in a sack.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Also,
 I should point out that we've got dozens of people here in the office 
who play the game all the time. Everybody in RPG R&amp;D is in at least 
one weekly game, and some folks play/DM two or three. Plus, many of the 
folks from the "other side" of R&amp;D, folks like Andrew Finch or Skaff
 Elias, play all the time too, and tell us when they find something 
weird or wrong.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: Where did you begin? How did you divide up the workload?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skip:</b> My personal task list went something like this:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(1) Review customer letters and internal comments and get to work fixing CRs and monster descriptions.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(2) Study the way people use the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 entries and look for ways to make them easier to use. (I led an 
internal focus group that put a lot of thought into this problem.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(3) Write new material.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(4) Playtest new material.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(5) Track the changes to the other two books and bring the <i>MM</i> in line with them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(6) Repeat as necessary.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rich Baker:</b>
 I worked on the project after Skip did. Skip took care of the Base 
Attack/Grapple line for every creature, he implemented our existing 
errata files (no small task, that!), and he worked to clarify awkward or
 imprecise language in a number of places. He also created a first draft
 of the How to Build a Monster chapter. The mandate I was given was to 
push the <i>Monster Manual</i> revisions more aggressively, so some of 
the tasks I worked on included chopping up the "gang" entries, building 
the glossary, creating the final chapter organization, and taking a 
number of monsters back to the drawing board (such as the new mummy we 
posted in our preview). Plus, I also pushed the decision to make monster
 skill point and feat acquisitions work like those of characters, and 
re-SPF'd (skill-pointed-and-feated, or "spiffed," as we called it) most 
of the monsters.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We
 involved a great number of people in the later stages of the book, so I
 didn't do all that by myself. Dave Eckelberry and Andrew Finch reworked
 the demons and devils extensively. Dave, Andrew, James Wyatt, and Mike 
Donais created most of the "advanced" versions of our monsters, such as 
the Nessian warhound and the aboleth mage. Editors Gwendolyn Kestrel and
 Jennifer Clarke Wilkes wound up taking on a significant amount of 
development work (such as SPF-ing and late format changes, like the new 
attack lines) and were absolutely instrumental in getting the project 
done on time. So, it was really a tremendous group effort.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jennifer</b>:
 In addition to doing some of the redesign and powered-up monsters, I 
backread material that had been edited to catch things that had changed 
since the original submission (there was a lot of design tinkering 
during the editorial phase) and to double-check the primary editor's 
work since she was developing at the same time as editing. It's easy for
 small details to fall through the cracks under the circumstances. (And 
there were plenty more to catch after my passes!)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn</b>:
 Skip and Rich had done a tremendous amount of work before Jennifer and I
 began our development and editing tasks. One of the most time-consuming
 aspects of the revision was updating the skills (new ways of 
determining skill points and synergy bonuses) and feats. Almost every 
creature changed in some way. There was a great deal to do. Jennifer and
 I dug in with a will.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ed: </b>Mostly,
 I tried to stay out of the way and let the designers and editors do 
their work. Seriously, I tried to provide support and the occasional 
"extra voice" when discussions over potential changes needed to happen. 
We seldom, if ever, made any changes in a vacuum. We had several online 
discussions and (at the very least) weekly face-to-face evaluations of 
different parts of the<i> MM</i> and the revisions in general. I felt it
 was my job to make sure everyone had the support they needed, which 
included a forum to discuss issues and someone to help them put an issue
 to rest, and to provide the occasional "schedule perspective," keeping 
everyone on track with their deadlines.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>WIZARDS: Which monster(s) received the most overhaul once you started digging in to the revisions? </b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rick Baker: </b>Demons
 and devils were reworked quite extensively, really reconcepted in some 
cases. In 3.0, these monsters tended to have "glass jaws." In many 
cases, the thing you wanted to do was get into melee fight with these 
guys, because they didn't have the hit points their CRs demanded. They 
definitely live up to their CRs now. There are a great number of 
relatively minor conceptual changes scattered throughout the book. For 
example, it used to be that characters killed by ghouls would rise as 
ghouls. That didn't seem to make much sense, since ghouls eat the people
 they kill, don't they? So we redesigned the ghoul's create spawn 
ability to become "ghoul fever," so that folks who were wounded by 
ghouls and survived would be at risk of transforming into ghouls by a 
disease-like mechanic. Finally, a significant number of creatures just 
got a little bit tougher through manipulation of AC or physical ability 
scores. The delver's AC in 3.0 was really low, when you consider that 
it's a high-CR rock monster. So we added a lot more natural armor to the
 delver, which makes it a more reasonable challenge at its CR and also 
makes logical sense, too. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gwendolyn: </b>Except
 for lavishing extra attention on the dragons, I don't recall spending 
significantly more time with any one creature over any other!</span></p>
