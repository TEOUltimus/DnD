<p><b>Designer Interview with Bruce Cordell, Gwendolyn F. M. Kestrel, J. D. Wiker, and Stan! Brown</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2007-02%20-%20Planar%20Handbook%20--%20A%20Player%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Planes_files/planar_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="215" width="168">In this month's exclusive interview, the designers of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179200000">Planar Handbook</a></i> discuss new ways for players to jet across the planes . . . voluntarily, or perhaps through no intention of their own.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: With just four designers and the entire scope of the planes to document, where do you begin?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce Cordell:</b> It's true that the <i>Planar Handbook</i>
 is ambitiously titled, which means we had to be selective in covering 
only those things we believed would be most useful to plane-venturing 
players. Essentially, after a few concept meetings involving the 
designers, as well as other Wizards staff members, the lead designer for
 the project (me) put together an outline of topics and divvied up the 
work among all the assigned designers. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn F. M. Kestrel:</b> This meant that we were 
able to play to our interests and strengths. Two of the topics that most
 interested me were the planar metropolises and prestige classes. 
Instead of having one default city as the base from which players 
operate, the book offers three very different choices: The City of 
Brass, Sigil, and Tu'narath. The prestige classes I wrote picked up much
 of the essence of <b>Planescape </b>factions, but with a wider appeal. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan! Brown:</b> I, on the other hand, have always 
found the best part of working with the planes to be the ability to fit 
adventures to wildly different settings that add thematically to the 
stories. When you're dealing with a finite setting, you have to make 
nods to things like geography, gravity, and the laws of physics. If the 
burning quest for knowledge is your theme, you might be able to add 
fiery elements to a planet-bound adventure. But in a planar adventure, 
you can place the action in a site where the world is made from fire or 
where volcanic rifts erupt all around the characters. I reveled in the 
chance to switch back and forth between various extreme settings and 
design sites that fit with them philosophically and thematically. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: For players new to the idea of multiplanar campaigns, what are the concepts behind them? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> We tried to come up with a few additional concepts beyond the tried-and-true plane-hopping campaign in the <i>Planar Handbook</i>.
 Traditionally, plane-hopping is a mid- to high-level campaign 
experience. While this can still remain true, we wanted to bring the 
planes a little closer to regular levels of play. One way we attempted 
to do this was through the concept of planar breaches: If you can't go 
to the planes, perhaps the planes will come to you. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Still another concept we incorporated was the idea of 
class substitution levels -- these are levels you take in your regular 
core class instead of a regular level, which are tuned more toward 
planar experience than the core class benefits of that level. Level 
substitutions are not multiclassing -- you stay within your core class, 
and once you substitute a given level, you can't gain the original 
benefits back. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Finally, we envisioned the concept of planar touchstones, which I'll talk about more in a minute.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The dozen or so new races are intriguing -- 
they seem to cover a wide range of favored classes, bonuses in 
languages, level adjustments, and ability adjustments (though some of 
those can seem harsh, like the earth mephling that gains strength and 
charisma but loses dex and intelligence). Do you have favorites among 
the new races? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> I designed the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/iw/20040613a&amp;page=2">neraph</a>,
 the Limbo-dwelling nomads who hunt the chaos motes using their special 
ability of motion camouflage (based on how a dragonfly hunts) and who 
are expert flingers of their deadly thin hunting weapon, the annulat. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> The mephlings (+1 LA) and spikers (+0 
LA) are low-level adjustment races that play off of critters of much 
higher level adjustments: mephits and bladelings. They retain much of 
the flavor of their cousin race, but have much more of a player 
character slant. The shadowswyfts (+1 LA) are a totally new race from 
the Plane of Shadow. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The powerful races I wrote up, the chain devil and the 
lillend, have much smoother, incremental gains in power than previous 
presentations. For instance, the chain devil begins with resistance to 
cold 5 at 1st level, becoming more and more resistant until he's finally
 immune at 14th level. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!:</b> I didn't actually design any of them, but I have to say that I am <i>really</i>
 looking forward to getting a chance to play a shadowswyft character. I 
mean, being a creature from the Plane of Shadow -- how cool is that? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>J. D. Wiker:</b> I designed the buomman and wildren, 
and I have to say that I like the buomman the best. Because they 
communicate in a kind of Tibetan-monk-throat-song, they make for an 
unusual roleplaying opportunity -- which I think really makes them stand
 out.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The organizations and prestige classes 
associated with some of them are rife with potential campaign arcs. (The
 Doomguard, and its citadels and doomlords, stands out in particular.) 
What are some of your favorites here? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> We wanted to cover a wide range of 
possibilities, while at the same time providing some congruity with 
concepts of previous planar campaigns. Thus, several of the prestige 
classes are "soldiers" of planar groups who follow strict plane-inspired
 philosophies. Many of those who live beyond the Material Plane feel 
they have a wider view of the way things actually work. To this end, 
various organizations, groups, and factions exist that teach ways of 
coping with the mind-boggling immensity of the multiverse. My favorite 
is the Bleak Cabal, which is a group that believes that "there is no 
higher purpose." They sponsor a prestige class with the title of 
"bleaker." </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> My first <b>Planescape</b> character 
had been a sensate, and I've always had a strong affection for the 
Society of Sensation; so, I must say that the ardent dilletant is my 
favorite. It's a prestige class that almost anyone can dabble in, but to
 seriously pursue it, you need to multiclass and acquire a wide 
diversity of skills and abilities. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!:</b> I really enjoyed working on the prestige 
classes. It was an interesting challenge to create a level progression 
for characters based as much on philosophy as they were on activity. The
 defiant prestige class (associated with the Athar faction) was 
particularly fun. Their main shtick is that they want to <i>prove</i> 
that the "gods" are not really deities at all, merely ultra-powerful 
mortals. So the defiant's abilities center around denying or defying 
divine powers. It appeals to the rebel in me. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>J. D.:</b> Ever since the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882420000">Manual of the Planes</a></i>
 came out, I've been fascinated with the "relative physics" aspect of 
the Astral Plane. So, for my money, the astral dancer was a great 
opportunity to explore the possibilities. I think fans of the fight 
choreography from <i>The Matrix</i> will really get a charge out of 
playing an astral dancer. Of the material written by the other 
designers, the chaotician almost immediately caught my eye; I could 
easily see using this prestige class in my own campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The equipment and magic items seem to have 
the strongest immediate use for players who are still ramping up in a 
multiplanar campaign, as PCs can find some of these items on the 
Material Plane right away. What's new in this section that players 
familiar with planar treasures might not have seen before? (The <i>planar deck of illusions</i> seems destined to be a hot item!) </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> Because this a <i>Planar Handbook</i> and 
therefore aimed at players, we wanted to be sure to include a robust 
section on mounts, vehicles, and even services that would provide access
 between planes. Therefore players will find prices for elsewhales, 
astral skiffs, ethereal tunnelers, and more. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> The planes offer such interesting 
environments and challenges to players. Magic items that emphasize or 
compensate for them just make so much good sense.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>J.D.:</b> I have to agree about the <i>planar deck of illusions --</i><i>I'd</i> certainly want one. But I also like the simplicity of the <i>rope of crossing</i> (which lets a character travel easily between layers of a given Outer Plane) and the <i>boots of gravity</i> (another application of that relative physics concept).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Of the wide variety of new spells now 
available, which would you consider among the most powerful? And what's 
the general principle behind how planar spells work on the Material 
Plane -- does it differ much from how other spells work? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> Those familiar with older iterations of 
planar magic may recall cumbersome limits to divine spellcasting. Of 
course, with the 3rd Edition <b>D&amp;D</b><i>Manual of the Planes</i>, 
we revealed a much simpler method of spell interaction (and divine 
spellcasters were happy not to receive the shaft). In a nutshell, 
particular planes may have one or more traits that have the possibility 
of modifying certain classes of spells. Essentially, a plane has either 
normal magic, dead magic, wild magic, impeded magic, or enhanced magic 
--that's covered in the <i>Manual of the Planes</i>, though. For the most part, plane-hopping adventurers will find that their spells work fairly normally. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> A new spellcasting feature in the book
 is the concept of planar domains. The granted powers and spell 
selection are better than standard domains because these more powerful 
domains count as both of a cleric's domain selections.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The astral kraken and the gaspar are just 
two examples of monsters that have guaranteed freak-out encounters 
written all over them. You must have favorites from among all these 
very, very cool new creatures. Which would you advise players to keep a 
sharp eye out for while traveling the planes? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce: </b>Characters need not even leave the 
Material Plane to fear an encounter with a dharculus, a creature which 
exists mostly in the Ethereal Plane, but who extends its many feeding 
mouths into the Material. There, it appears to the corporeal eye as a 
swarm of blind, eel-like creatures wriggling through open air. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> I wrote the gaspar with the intention 
of making a creature that would provide an interesting tool for the DM. 
The creature has a plane-shifting defensive ability that causes everyone
 within a 10-foot radius of the gaspar to make a Will save or be 
transported to a random plane (all creatures go to the same plane). As 
an alternate use for the monster, rules are given on how to train it so 
that it can act as a plane-traveling mount. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!:</b> My favorite new monster is the elsewhale 
-- a Gargantuan cetacean that swims from plane to plane. I just love the
 image of being in a boat chasing this tremendous creature that suddenly
 disappears completely. What I love even more is the idea that these 
beasts can be trained to carry passengers. Just picture a group of 
heroes arriving on a planar shore by stepping out of the mouth of this 
behemoth.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>J. D.:</b> The astral kraken seemed to me like a 
perfect "nightmare creature" to have wandering about the Astral Plane. 
But, really, the creature that's liable to catch players off-guard is 
the Elysian thrush. After all, who notices the sound of birds singing, 
even when it's increasing your healing rate? The thrush's song is 
beneficial, though only up to a point. After eight hours, the character 
becomes too content to leave.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: The Planar Sites chapter offers a wide 
variety of adventure opportunities. Planar breaches, for instance, seem 
like a wonderful opportunity to throw any campaign for blindsiding loop.
 Did you come away with some that you liked (or disliked, for the right 
reasons, of course) more than others? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> Of particular interest in the Planar Sites
 chapter is the large section on Touchstone Sites. When we first 
starting concepting this book, one of the themes that came up was "why 
do players want to go to the planes?" The answer we came up with was 
this: Perhaps they'd like to form a link with an extra-planar power 
source that provides them with both a constant, feat-like ability, as 
well as a rechargeable uber-ability associated with each particular 
planar location! </p>
<p align="LEFT">Planar touchstones are places in the cosmos that 
resonate with unique forms of energy. Those able to form a linkage with 
these special locations are rewarded with a heady charge of supernatural
 power, which they can use up quickly or ration for later use. Once used
 up, the supernatural power recharges with another visit to the 
touchstone site, while the base ability associated with the site always 
remains available. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!:</b> What I <i>really</i> liked about working 
on this section was the ability to match a location or encounter with a 
site that fit it thematically. One of my favorites is the Library of 
Ignorance, a nearly empty building located on a vast icy plane in 
Carceri. I also like the Cavern of the Self in windswept Pandemonium, a 
place where a creature can literally see reflections of every facet of 
his personality. But my favorite is probably the Lip of Purity on 
Arcadia, where you can sit in a tranquil patch of a river and watch the 
water flow off the layer of Abellio down to the layer of Buxenus below 
-- from the edge of one infinite plane to the center of another. Now 
that's just mind blowing. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: What didn't make it into the <i>Planar Handbook</i> that you hoped would?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!:</b> There were a few ideas that we tossed 
around that, while interesting, didn't have enough meatiness. They were 
cool concepts that we just couldn't figure out how to attach to game 
material.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: Is there more material for a second volume? Are there more planar-related products planned? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> None appear currently in the catalogue, 
but the planes are infinite, and I'd like to believe that given such a 
source, there is always the possibility for more planar-related 
products. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> The planes offer such possibilities. I hope that we do another book focused on them. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!: </b>With the planes being infinite and all, we're always imagining new and interesting corners of them to explore. Of course, <i>finding</i> a corner in an infinite space can be a challenge in and of itself, but I hope we get the chance to try again. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: What is each of you working on now? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bruce:</b> A book that everyone will want because it focuses on those things that every player pores through the back of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> to covet, long for, and slaver over. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> I'm currently a managing editor for the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179210000">Monster Manual III</a>,</i> which contains a whole bunch of very cool monsters, more than a few of which I've also designed. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stan!:</b> I just finished working with a group of really talented people on a book called <i>Modern Magic</i> that will be released by <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.thegamemechanics.com/products/modernmagic1.asp&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20040702a">The Game Mechanics</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.greenronin.com/cgi-bin/product.cgi?prodid=1504&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20040702a">Green Ronin</a> in June (available now in PDF form.
