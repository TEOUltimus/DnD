 accessory discuss these magic weapons that evolve and unlock new 
powers, and why a character's favorite weapon no longer needs be 
consigned once its owner has advanced.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards of the Coast: From the Bones of Li-Peng: <i>"If
 you meet the Enlightened One on the road, kill him." The student 
pondered this, and realized that what the master meant was that no man 
could lead another to enlightenment, and to claim otherwise was to be 
naught but a charlatan and a trickster." </i>Well, that being said, I'm still hoping you can at least lead me partway to enlightenment regarding <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>! First of all, how did this book come about? Was there a desire to expand upon the brief legendary weapons section in <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce Cordell:</b> I suppose that's it (from a Brand 
perspective), though I wasn't familiar with that section until I was 
well into design. To me, the idea was simply this: in fantasy fiction, a
 character keeps the famous weapon or magic item he acquires during the 
course of the story. In D&amp;D, a character trades up the first chance 
he gets, leaving his ancestral weapon in some unnamed pawnshop. We 
wanted to create an experience in D&amp;D that gave a character an 
option that allowed him or her to follow the fiction model with acquired
 magical weapons and items.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: As the intro states, a convincing argument 
could be made that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is all about "the stuff." Was 
there discussion within R&amp;D about taking a very item-centric 
approach with this book? There are fewer character elements (prestige 
classes for example, though the Legacy Champion and integral legacy 
feats are also introduced) in lieu of emphasizing the weapons 
themselves.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce: </b>Sure--this book is completely about the 
stuff. However, in developing an item of legacy's progression, an 
intimate knowledge of player character ability had to be kept in mind at
 all times. Because D&amp;D characters are so concerned with their 
stuff, I'd say this book is as much about characters as any other player
 book, if not more so.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stephen Schubert:</b> Of course, but this book 
focuses just as much on the items of power as on the characters who 
wield them. Simply finding a legacy weapon won't boost a PC's power 
level dramatically--since most legacy items initially appear somewhat 
benign. The key is that a character needs to be of a certain level of 
power, and needs to accomplish specific goals, in order to unlock the 
full power of a legacy weapon. The result is a system where a 
character's item grows with the character himself. In this way, while 
the legacy weapon is an item of tremendous power, it doesn't overshadow 
the power of the PC.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What defines a weapon of legacy? What sets 
it apart from a standard magical item (or even an artifact)? After all, a
 +1 longsword is always a +1 longsword... or is it?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce:</b> The defining characteristic of a weapon of
 legacy is that it gets better as a character does. Why? Because the 
item is either part of an epic history that the character slowly 
discovers, or perhaps the epic history is the one that occurs while the 
weapon is in the character's possession. The results are the same--the 
weapon's abilities advance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stephen:</b> In general, a weapon of legacy has 
significantly more power than a typical magic item, and at the highest 
of character levels, a legacy item might rival a minor artifact in 
power. Standard items could transform into legacy weapons; a +1 
longsword could become a weapon of legacy--perhaps it always was, but 
the wielder simply wasn't aware of its heritage until some specific 
condition was met, or perhaps its wielder founds a new legacy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: I've known many a player who's refused to 
part with the first +1 weapon he's found for a +2 weapon or better later
 on, because they have such a connection and history with their trusty 
+1; in what ways do weapons of legacy compliment this playing style?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce: </b>Now that player doesn't have to let that 
weapon go--the rules allow that player to keep that weapon as a potent 
tool in his or her arsenal.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stephen:</b> As a DM, I've always liked having PCs 
that tried to keep the same weapon, assigning some historical or 
background significance to the item, and truly making that item part of 
the character. Weapons of Legacy encourages these PCs to grow the story 
of their weapon even further, and a legacy item can continue to remain 
relevant at all stages of an adventurer's career.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Allowing players the ability to found their 
own legacies seems quite powerful indeed; how can players found legacies
 specific to their characters' needs? What powers are available?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce:</b> There is an extensive set of level-keyed menus in <i>Weapons of Legacy</i> that provide pre-balanced choices on abilities appropriate to founding and developing a personal weapon of legacy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: At the same time, nothing comes without its 
price (I assume); are there potential drawbacks to possessing and 
wielding a weapon of legacy?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce:</b> Balancing a weapon of legacy against 
excepted character wealth at a given level was job one during the 
development phase of this project (which I was also part of). After 
pegging the allowed discrepancy between expected character wealth and 
what a weapon of legacy could provide, we developed a way to accrue 
non-monetary costs to wielders that make sure that each weapon's granted
 abilities at a given level is appropriate for the wielder. For 
instance, when you awaken an ability in your sword, you might also find 
that in order to keep that ability active, you suffer a -1 save penalty.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: There's a quite the array among the fifty 
fully designed weapons of legacy. Was there a desire to round out the 
weapons types, or focus on any type (i.e., swords) in particular? Do you
 have any favorites?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce:</b> We wanted to provide a few weapon types to
 every type of melee combatant, as well as provide items for non-melee 
combatants (such as staves and rings for magic user types). There are 
also a couple of psionic weapons of legacy, including a weapon that can 
fuse with a mind blade: <i>Mau-Jehe</i>, which begins life as a 'mundane' seeming +1 punching dagger.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stephen: </b>We made an effort in the development process to ensure that the weapons appeal to all the core classes from the <i>PHB</i>,
 and a couple that work for psionic characters. We didn't want the book 
to simply be a book of swords, but instead provide a wide range of 
options for PCs, including a variety of swords, as well as spears, 
clubs, flails, exotic weapons, monk weapons, and items that aren't 
weapons. Of course, the book also provides the rules for creating your 
own custom weapon of legacy. In lieu of a weapon customized for my 
character, I would want to work in flamecaster's bolt, since I've got a 
thing for crossbows, or the sling of the dire wind, because it's so 
unassuming to have a legacy sling!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Each weapon also has its various degrees of 
known history, depending on the success of the Knowledge (history) 
check. Any inspirations to share on where these histories derived? Was 
there any insight gained from, or nods to, weapons of real world 
mythology/legacy (i.e., Excalibur)?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce: </b>The freelancers Kolja Raven Liquette and 
Travis Stout came up with most of the histories. However, one of those I
 did write was the weapon <i>Exordius</i>, which I suppose is inspired by <i>Stormbringer</i>, in that <i>Exordius</i> is an evil blade through which good is sometimes accomplished. In <i>Exordius'</i>
 case, the blade swallowed absorbed a pure soul that it couldn't digest,
 which transformed the blade into the ambivalent, but potent weapon that
 it is today. The scattered bits of chapter introductory fiction all 
deal with <i>Exordius</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Shuluth the Mind Flayer appears as a monster
 of legacy. Shuluth also appears in the recent creature 
competition--granted, this isn't a combat competition, but who do you 
really think would come out on top between Shuluth and the Succubus 
Paladin?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bruce:</b> Depends on whether the succubus fails its save against Shuluth's mind blast... :-)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stephen: </b>Well, the succubus would have ridiculous
 saving throws, owing to her Charisma bonus and strong base saves for 
being an outsider, so it would seem that Shuluth would be challenged to 
affect the reformed demon with any psionic powers. Shuluth as presented 
in Weapons of Legacy might just need to try a mind blast and plane shift
 away if it fails. But Shuluth is cunning, and the creature competition 
indicates that he may have picked up some psion levels since his stats 
were captured for the book -- and with the right selection of powers, he
 could find the upper hand. Shuluth is a mastermind, and his archvillain
 persona would take out the do-gooder succubus before she even knew he 
was there. At any rate, I'd like Shuluth to win. I have a thing for mind
 flayers, and they make great minis, too!</p>
