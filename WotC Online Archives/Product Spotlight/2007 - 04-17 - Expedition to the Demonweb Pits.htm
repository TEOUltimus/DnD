 takes characters from the planar city of Sigil to the darkest corners 
of the Outer Planes, gathering resources to battle the forces of Lloth, 
Demon Queen of Spiders. The PCs must navigate a carefully spun web of 
treachery and deceit to reach the violent heart of Lloth's domain and 
put and end to her sinister dreams of conquest.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b><i>Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</i>
 releases this month, a campaign adventure spanning several daunting 
planes of existence. To start with, fans of the 1st edition <i>Queen of the Spiders</i> series may well remember module <i>Q1: The Demonweb Pits</i>. Was <i>Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</i> influenced by this module, designed as a revision, or is it a completely new expedition? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang Baur:</b> Of course <i>Expedition</i> was influenced by <i>Q1</i>, since there would be no Demonweb Pits without that classic module. But we took the plot in a new direction, focusing on <i>Planescape</i>
 elements such as the cities of Sigil and Zelatar, plus a wider web than
 the first one. Many elements carry across the history of the Demonweb: 
from 1st edition's <i>Q1</i>, from "The Harrowing" in <i>Dungeon</i> magazine #84, and from 2nd edition's <i>Planes of Chaos</i>. It's a place that has grown over time, and we're continuing that exploration. Possibly with more demons than usual.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> As far as the drow, they've long been 
hugely popular (and formidable) adversaries--what are they now up to, 
necessitating the PCs' involvement and journey to the Demonweb? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang: </b> They're allying themselves with other 
demon lords, and the combination of drow cunning and cruelty with brute 
demonic power is pretty deadly. Lolth is making a big play for power in 
the Abyss and beyond.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> For PCs looking to better combat the 
drow, the book offers two new prestige classes. What can you tell us 
about the demonwrecker and the jaunter? What benefits might they provide
 a party undergoing this campaign adventure? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> Both prestige classes were designed 
for use by player characters, and focused on abilities that would be 
very useful both in this adventure and in a broader campaign. I'd be 
very surprised by any party that didn't seriously contemplate having 
group members train in at least one of these classes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-17%20-%20Expedition%20to%20the%20Demonweb%20Pits_files/dx20070417_spotlight_jaunter.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="350" width="240">The
 demonwrecker is a fantastic class for any spellcaster seeking to get 
better at combating chaotic evil outsiders. Both a divine and an arcane 
version are included. The class focuses specifically on the typical 
qualities of demons. For the cleric or divine caster, the class offers 
much improved spell penetration and the ability to bypass DR in melee. 
For the arcane caster, the class provides the improved spell penetration
 and a unique ability to smite with a spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> The jaunter, well, <i>jaunts</i>. The prestige class 
presents characters, likely non-spellcasters, with the opportunity to 
gain spell-like travel powers. The class is a great boon to any party in
 terms of whole-party campaign travel with <i>teleport</i> and <i>plane shift</i>, but also provides effective tactical options with increased movement, <i>benign transposition</i>, and <i>freedom of movement</i> powers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Along the course of the adventure, <i>Expedition to the Demonweb Pit</i>
 leads through Sigil. What decision led to a return here, the "most 
famous planar metropolis in all existence?" Were you daunted or excited 
to further develop this planar metropolis? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b> Wolfgang:</b> I wrote <i>In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil</i>,
 so it felt more like returning to a familiar neighborhood. Sigil is a 
wonderful crossroads town, and it simplifies the design of any 
multiplanar adventure, which is why Zeb Cook created it, I'm sure. The 
real reason for returning to Sigil is based on some of the characters 
that the heroes will meet, including both treacherous and helpful 
creatures in unexpected places. Plus, I got to throw in the Lady's 
library, a place I think may lead to some interesting encounters. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2007%20-%2004-17%20-%20Expedition%20to%20the%20Demonweb%20Pits_files/dx20070417_spotlight_ratatosk.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="382" width="225">Wizards: </b>
 For those not familiar with Sigil, how would you explain the City of 
Doors... and for those who may have visited in the past, what new 
features might they discover? And, just who (or what) is the mysterious 
Rule of Three?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang:</b> The City of Doors is the place where 
all the planar gateways connect, a city at the center of the cosmos on 
top of an infinite spire in the Outlands. Frequent visitors will find a 
map of a familiar tavern, and a new and important temple. There's even 
updated statistics for the dabus, the crucial inhabitants of Sigil who 
serve as the Lady of Pain's eyes, ears, and hands.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Rule of Threes is just the way that things in the 
planes come in threes: good things, bad things, law/chaos/neutrality, 
primes, planars, and petitioners. To quote Zeb Cook, "See two things and
 ask--where's the third?"</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> From Sigil, PCs may find themselves 
climbing the boughs of Yggdrasil, the world tree. A component of Norse 
mythological cosmology, how does it feature within <i>Expedition</i>? How does it connect the various "roads" leading to and from it? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang:</b> Most planar travel is through gates and
 portals, but Yggdrasil is different because it's a more literal path, 
even though it's a slower way to get around. And it has its own 
inhabitants, such the linnorm and the ratatosk (yes, they're back).</p>
<p align="LEFT"> The World Tree has connections to several valuable 
items that the PCs might want--but it's also just a cool way to travel 
the planes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> On then, to the Demonweb! For those who
 might not have had the pleasure of vacationing on the 66th layer of the
 Abyss, what can they expect in terms of its dangers--environmental as 
well as perhaps in terms of new creatures? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang:</b> The environment is exactly the same as it was first described for 3E in the <i>Harrowing</i>.
 The creatures are rather different though; I think the carnevus demon 
might get a lot of attention, and new giants, new mephits, and some 
updates like the lamia noble. Plus, there are several new Demon Lord 
aspects. A place as chaotic and fertile with evil as the Abyss should 
always include a fistful of new demon types; we don't want players 
getting too complacent.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-17%20-%20Expedition%20to%20the%20Demonweb%20Pits_files/dx20070417_spotlight_demon.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="320" width="240"><b>Wizards: </b>
 Any advice for DMs running encounters in this layer, or for PCs 
planning an expedition there (outside of their weapons and of course, 
what #1 spell or piece of gear you would recommend they have on hand)? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang:</b> Scrolls of <i>raise dead</i> are always helpful in the Abyss.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> The items of legacy offer great power 
to PCs wanting to do well in the adventure. The items can be acquired 
early in the adventure and will be great assets. <i>Spidersilk</i> is a mithral shirt most arcane casters will love. <i>Thaas</i>, "The Vigilant Bow," is ideal for an archer in <i>Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Throughout the adventure, encounters are presented in the new format as seen in <i>Expedition to Castle Ravenloft</i>. What led to the development of this encounter format? How does it look to benefit DMs? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> We wanted to make it easy for DMs to 
run encounters, providing them with all the information they need right 
there: monsters, maps, features of the room, read-aloud text. Very 
convenient. Very challenging to the adventure designer. It makes us work
 harder so the DM doesn't have to.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I'd earlier worked in the format with <i>Scourge of the Howling Hordes</i>, and folks have seen and used it in <i>Expedition to Castle Ravenloft</i> and in <i>Cormyr</i>. Dave Noonan created the first version of the format to use for the Dungeon Delve in the Wizards of the Coast booth at Gen Con.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A very good description of the origins and background of the format can be found in Dave's <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060317a">Design &amp; Development</a> article.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Do you have any especially favorite 
encounters from the book, either in terms of design or running your 
groups through them? What might the PCs be wise to watch out for? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang:</b> My favorite encounters are all in 
Zelatar, the demon city. I've always wanted to revisit it since first 
creating it in the 2E era (in <i>Planes of Chaos</i>). Having Graz'zt 
play a role in the adventure meant that a visit was pretty much 
required, but it's not the sort of place that's easy for even fairly 
powerful PCs to run all over. Yes, demons are allowed to be 
ultra-violent, but visitors to the city need to be careful about who 
they kill, and how. It doesn't do to draw too much attention.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-17%20-%20Expedition%20to%20the%20Demonweb%20Pits_files/dx20070417_spotlight_bow.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="394" width="240"><b>Gwendolyn:</b>
 What I like best about the adventure is the combination of encounters. 
There's combat, roleplaying/social encounters, and great opportunities 
for stealth. To succeed, a party needs to think and assess what they're 
going to do. The group with a single-minded, "problem = nail, and party =
 hammer" approach is apt to need those scrolls of <i>raise dead</i> that
 Wolf advocated bringing. A more flexible group, able to conquer 
challenges using shadows or smiles as well as swords will do better and 
have lots of fun.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Ultimately, the PCs might well face the
 Queen of Spiders herself, correct (or one of her suitably nasty 
representatives)? Perhaps even more terrifying, Lloth does not look to 
be the only Aspect presented. Who else might the PCs meet--and might 
there be ways to avoid combating each one? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolfgang:</b> Without giving too much away, yes, a 
fistful of demon lord aspects are wandering around the Demonweb with 
some big ideas. And a party that wants to fight them all can do so 
(that's the beauty of using Aspects, from a design perspective). A party
 that wants to save their resources for a confrontation with Lolth might
 choose not to fight every demon lord they see; it's up to them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards: </b> Should the PCs ultimately prevail, what
 rewards wait in store for them--in terms of outcomes affected, as well 
as more monetary gifts: new items of legacy, perhaps? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gwendolyn:</b> While the items of legacy come early 
in the adventure, but other monetary and magic treasure provide great 
incentives for the treasure-focused party. The challenges are exciting 
and the experience should be plentiful. Unfolding the story and finding 
out just what's going on will reward inquisitive players. But the PCs 
have an opportunity to save the multiverse from an unholy alliance of 
demons. What's a better reward than that?</p>
