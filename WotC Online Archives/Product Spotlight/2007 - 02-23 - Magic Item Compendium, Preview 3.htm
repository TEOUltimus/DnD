 explores several new item types. The first two entries previewed in 
this series dealt with augment crystals and runestaffs . This 
installment covers magic item sets, groups of thematically linked magic 
items that when worn together, grant greater power than if the items are
 worn individually. These abilities increase or scale with the number of
 items worn. If the wearer collects all of the items in a set, she gains
 a potent ability that follows the set's theme.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each individual item in a magic item set is a viable 
piece of treasure on its own. A character can wear or use this item as 
he would any other, without ever knowing (or needing to know) about the 
other items in a set. Any item can, however, be the jumping off point 
for collecting the entire set. In other words, the items do not need to 
be acquired in order. Generally, however, items are accumulated based on
 their price. DMs are likely to include lower cost items in low-level 
treasure hoards, waiting until the characters have reached a sufficient 
level before introducing costlier items into the game. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Each magic item set is based on a theme or story. The 
items began as an original set, a legendary group of items belonging to a
 great hero or affecting the results of a monumental event. Their secret
 was subsequently learned, allowing the items and their collective 
benefits to be recreated.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Two tables accompany each magic item set. The first table, "<i>Set Name</i>
 Pieces and Abilities," summarizes the abilities of the set's individual
 items, their prices, and the body slots they use. A quick glance at 
this table helps to determine if the item would be useful to an 
individual character; most item sets are of greatest benefit to a 
specific class (such as <i>Gharyn's Monastic Array</i> detailed below, for the monk) or subset of classes (skill/scoundrel types or arcane casters). The second table, "<i>Set Name </i>Collection
 Benefits," summarizes what is gained by collecting more than one of the
 items in the set. It mentions how many items are necessary to gain each
 benefit and what happens when all of the items have been accumulated.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Magic item sets are a great plot device for any game. 
With built-in stories, these items can be dropped into many campaigns 
with fairly little additional work. Because the items are typically 
scattered all over a campaign world, they provide an avenue for 
collection quests: adventures series designed to bring items together 
for a greater purpose.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Gharyn's Monastic Array</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The half-moon shaped blade of the kama is dangerous enough, but it becomes deadly when infused with the power of <i>ki. </i>When
 wielding this array of monastic tools, you become as the wind: at times
 violent and unstoppable, at other times a darting blur of speed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Gharyn's monastic array </i>is most useful to a monk,
 especially one who uses a kama to enhance her hand-to-hand fighting. 
Each of the items allows its wielder to better mimic the natural 
movements of a certain animal, and some wielders believe that by 
mimicking the motions found in nature, they will be able to merge their 
physical and spiritual consciousnesses. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lore</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (arcana), or who have the bardic knowledge ability, can research <i>Gharyn's monastic array</i>
 to learn more about the items. When a character succeeds on a check, 
the following lore is revealed, including the information from lower 
DCs. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC 15: </b> The original monastic array was 
discovered amid the ashes of a fallen monk known as Gharyn. He died 
sacrificing his life to protect his brother monks from the wrath of a 
red dragon. Many believe that the dragon's fire charged <i>Gharyn's </i>array with magical power. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC 20:</b> The Monastery of the Lone Dove, a haven 
for ascetic monks devoted to Pelor, had strict policies of asceticism, 
silence, and discipline. Brothers ate two bowls of rice per day, were 
allowed to speak ten words outside of prayer, and had to be in their 
chambers by sundown. Some brothers chafed under this strict regimen. One
 was a monk named Gharyn. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Gharyn didn't believe such restrictions applied to him. 
While he espoused the support of law and order, he felt the monastery's 
strictures were meaningless, and he claimed they even hindered the 
success of a lawful society. Needless to say, this belief did not make 
him particularly popular among his very conservative and traditional 
brothers. He knew that a change was needed, but that it had to occur 
gradually for the brothers to accept it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><br> Gharyn slowly altered his behavior and routine. He 
substituted barley for his bowl of rice and used long, multisyllabic 
words for his ten per day. He was in his room by sundown, but stayed up 
well past midnight. </p>
<p align="LEFT">While many brothers objected to his actions, Gharyn 
developed a cult following in the monastery. He began to train his 
supporters in unusual fighting styles from around the world. He urged 
them to reject meaningless strictures, but encouraged people to follow 
the greater rules of society. This was not a rejection of order as much 
as an acknowledgment of the universe's true laws and mysteries. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Monastery of the Lone Dove had begun proceedings to 
expel Gharyn, but fate stepped in when a flight of rampaging dragons 
attacked. Many of the monks, so used to their daily routines, were 
unable to conduct a proper defense against a siege by dragons. Gharyn 
took charge and led the monks in battle, proving an able leader. In the 
end, he sacrificed himself by shielding the other monks from the breath 
of a red dragon. His sacrifice gave the others time to mount an offense 
that repelled the dragons. In his ashes, three items remained: a set of 
foot wrappings, a mask, and a kama. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The items that remained among Gharyn's ashes became the 
uniform of the Monastery of the Lone Dove. The monks traveled far and 
wide, popularizing the beliefs--and attire--of Gharyn. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC</b><b>25: </b> A monk named Nobara Lame decries 
Gharyn's memory, saying that those who fondly remember the rebellious 
monk are lying to themselves: Strictures bring structure, structure 
lends itself to law and an ascetic lifestyle. Nobara's anger over the 
rebellious spirit popularized by Gharyn's "lucky" sacrifice has grown so
 extreme that his days are now spent traveling between monasteries to 
proclaim his views. Whenever he comes upon someone wearing a piece of 
Gharyn's monastic array, whether original or a copy, he calls that 
person out in a duel to the death. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DC</b><b>30: </b> A check result of 30 or higher 
reveals the location of another piece of the set. Use this to drive 
further adventure and direct the PCs toward some location or story you 
would like them to explore. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Collection benefits</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Any combination of two parts of Gharyn's monastic array 
grants deadly efficacy to your stunning attacks and gives your physical 
movement an animalistic swiftness and savagery. When using all three 
pieces, your arm briefly seems to take the form of a striking scorpion's
 tail. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>2 Pieces: </b> Add +1 to the save DC of your Stunning Fist attacks. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>3 Pieces: </b> When you score a critical hit with a 
scorpion kama, you can expend one of your daily uses of Stunning Fist as
 a free action to make that attack a stunning attack. (If you don't have
 the Stunning Fist feat, this benefit has no effect).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cobra Straps</b><br><b>Price (Item Level): </b> 1,400 gp (5th)<br><b>Body Slot: </b> Feet<br><b>Caster Level: </b> 5th<br><b>Aura: </b> Faint; (DC 17) transmutation<br><b>Activation: </b> Free (mental)<br><b>Weight: </b> --</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>These simple green straps are meant to be wrapped around the feet.</i><i></i></p>
<p align="LEFT"> When you make an unarmed attack at the end of a charge,
 immediately after you attempt the attack, you can activate cobra straps
 to move 5 feet away from the target without provoking attacks of 
opportunity. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Prerequisites</i>: Craft Wondrous Item, <i>expeditious retreat,</i> possession of a piece of the set. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Cost to Create</i>: 700 gp, 56 XP, 2 days.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This silk half-mask unmistakably mimics the visage of a hunting cat.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A panther mask grants you the benefit of the Run feat. 
If you wear light or no armor, you also gain a +5-foot enhancement bonus
 to your land speed. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This simple kama is unadorned except for a single scorpion etched into the blade.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">This +1 kama deals damage equal to your unarmed strike damage (if that is greater than the normal damage for a kama). </p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>Gharyn's monastic array </i>is an example of a magic 
item set created during a dramatic event. In this case, the 
idiosyncratic monk known as Gharyn sacrifices his life to protect his 
brother monks; his immolation charges his monastic equipment with 
supernatural power. Later generation study the items, learning their 
secrets and becoming able to recreate them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Gharyn's monastic array </i>is an example of a 
smaller magic item set available at low-to mid-levels of play. While the
 set is of primary use to a monk, the <i>panther mask</i> is useful to all characters, and some characters that use unarmed strikes might make use of the other two items.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While each item is perfectly functional on its own, it 
is only when all three are accumulated that their synergy is truly 
reached. When two items are collected, all stunning attack DCs are 
raised by 1. When all three items are collected, the wielder can make a 
Stunning Fist attack as a free action whenever she scores a critical 
hit. A character with all three items is a blurring human weapon of 
great speed and unpredictability. </p>
