 discusses the book's three new magic types -- pact, shadow, and 
truename magic... including what entities your characters can enter into
 pacts with.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the interests of better involving the player community with the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, questions for this interview were solicited in part via the <a target="_blank" href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=8412808">message boards</a>, and our thanks to all players who participated.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b>To start with an easy one (ha!): What inspired the creation of <i>Tome of Magic</i>?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew Sernett: </b>The concept for the book started
 with the idea of doing something about "advanced magic." We wanted to 
show people something new, and take magic to a different place for the 
game. We struck upon the individual themes for the three types of magic 
(pact magic, shadow magic, and truename magic) as the most interesting 
among several areas of magic that <b>D&amp;D</b> hasn't explored very well up to this point.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b><i>Tome of Magic</i> looks to be 
three entire concepts rolled into a single sourcebook: pact magic, 
shadow magic and truename magic; in fact, each section has its own 
layout. Essentially, are these new magical elements that can be 
incorporated by existing spellcasting classes and with exiting systems 
(core spellcasting, psionics, incarnum)? Or are these separate systems, 
with their own core classes?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Each is a new system with a core class 
yes, but there are many ways for someone who doesn't want to make a new 
character use the magic systems in the book. The systems are largely 
more straightforward than either psionics or incarnum, and they have a 
traditional place in fantasy and thus <b>D&amp;D</b>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>What classes are available for 
each of these systems? What party niche do they look to fill (i.e., do 
they each fill the traditional role of the party spellcaster, or 
something less defined such as the bard)? Will these new classes be able
 to take advantage of existing PrCs and spellcasting feats (and 
vice-versa)?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>There are three classes: binder, 
shadowcaster, and truenamer. All occupy the spellcaster role in a 
slightly different manner, with a strong ability to play in another 
role. The binder can be an artillery battery like a sorcerer, but the 
class can also stand in for the melee combatant or the stealth required 
by a scout. The shadowcaster makes a good tricky spellcaster and a 
stand-in for the rogue. The truenamer makes a good replacement for the 
wizard, but the class has powerful protective and curing abilities that 
can also make it a decent replacement for a cleric. The book provides 
feats for each of the classes, enough to allow for tons of different 
character builds. Most existing spellcasting prestige classes and feats 
won't be very appropriate for either the themes of the classes or their 
abilities, but some will work well.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Pact Magic</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2003-06%20-%20Tome%20of%20Magic_files/dx0306ps_spotlight_acererak.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="332" width="200">Wizards:<i></i></b>How does the pact magic system function? How are pacts started and ended?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>In essence, the binder goes through a 
ritual to summon a special spirit called a vestige. This might involve 
certain special conditions, but in all cases the binder must draw a seal
 peculiar to the vestige and call out to it. Then the binder and spirit 
take some time to strike a bargain--the pact. This can be roleplayed 
based on the personality of the spirit, but ultimately the spirit wants 
to be bound to the binder, and it's just a matter of whether or not that
 binding gives the spirit some control over the binder. The player 
playing a binder makes a special binding check to determine whether or 
not this is the case. When the bargain is struck, the summoned spirit 
vanishes. The binder remains bound to this spirit and may use the powers
 it grants until he makes a pact with another spirit (although binders 
of higher level may make pacts with more than one vestige at a time).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>How does pact magic differ from 
traditional divine spell casting; for example, what's the functional 
difference between a character who's made a pact with an archdevil, and a
 cleric that receives spells from an archdevil?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Vestiges aren't devils and demons in the
 usual sense. That would relegate pact magic to evil PCs and NPCs. Also,
 I didn't want a character to lose abilities because someone kills the 
demon or devil the pact was made with. Instead, vestiges are strange 
amoral beings that most churches, good or evil, consider taboo because 
the spirits can't be touched by the gods. All vestige-granted abilities 
are supernatural, making them impossible to dispel. Also, vestiges 
inhabiting a binder can't be banished or killed. Only an <i>antimagic field</i> can stop a binder from using his vestige-granted powers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The powers vestiges grant rarely resemble spells in any 
significant fashion. As with all supernatural abilities, there are no 
components of any kind. Some require an action to use, but others are 
simply always active, such as if a vestige grants damage reduction.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT">One example vestige includes Acererak, fiendish creator of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20051031a">Tomb of Horrors</a></i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Acererak, the Devourer: </b>Acererak, a half-human 
lich, grasped at godlike power only to lose his grip on reality. As a 
vestige, he grants abilities that are similar to a lich's powers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>If vestiges aren't devils and 
demons in the traditional sense, what sort of entities can offer you 
pacts? Strictly of the evil variety, or with good outsiders, or other 
entities as well (such as lost souls, undead)? If you were to make a 
pact with an entity, which one would you choose?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Vestiges are spirits detached from the 
multiverse. They exist not on any plane or in any place anyone can 
reach. Their only window into reality comes from being summoned by 
binders making pacts with them. That's why they do it--to get a glimpse 
outside the otherworldly prison in which they somehow reside. Binders 
allow them to peer through the bars. These spirits might once have been 
angels, devils, gods, or mortals--and examples of all of those exist in 
the book--but existing separate from reality has twisted them and driven
 the mad. Vestiges aren't really good or evil. They lend their abilities
 to anyone with the power to reach them, granting power just to hear, 
see, and feel again.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Shadow Magic</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>How does the shadow magic system function? What precisely is the difference between a mystery and a standard spell?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Mysteries and spells share many 
similarities, but as you gain levels and your connection to the Plane of
 Shadow grows, mysteries become easier to cast, changing from spells to 
spell-like abilities, and finally to supernatural abilities. Mysteries 
follow certain paths of philosophy, and a shadowcaster can be a 
jack-of-all-trades or a specialist.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>How does shadow magic differ from (or interact with) the shadow subschool of Illusion spells? Does it overlap or replace it?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>The shadow subschool barely scratches 
the surface of what shadow magic can do. Shadow spells are only 
partially real, and thus depend on belief for their full efficacy. A few
 mysteries have a similar restriction, but all the others are wholly 
real, transforming the environment, creatures, or the existence of 
energies with material drawn directly from the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>Is there relation between shadow magic and shadow weave from the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>, or the flying city of shadovar and the race of shades?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>The book does talk about this. In 
essence, no. In shadow magic, the shadowcaster is a conduit to the Plane
 of Shadow. The shadowcaster causes magic to happen by drawing bits of 
the Plane of Shadow through that connection. The shadow weave represents
 the negative space in the weave on Toril, using the flipside of 
traditional magic and spells. Although the shadovar lived on the Plane 
of Shadow, the two forms of magic are very different. Of course, having 
lived on the Plane of Shadow, I'm certain many shadowvar employ shadow 
magic and are probably the means of its introduction to the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Truename Magic</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2003-06%20-%20Tome%20of%20Magic_files/dx0306ps_spotlight_truename.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="291" width="225">Wizards:<i></i></b>What
 exactly is meant by truenames, and how are they being used to fuel 
spellcasting -- if someone were to learn your truename (hint: Matthew 
Sernett) what powers could they hold over you?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Truenames aren't quite that simple. 
Truenames represent part of a universal language, the strange words of 
power that existed as soon as anything existed. Thus truenames encompass
 everything, not just people's names. Truenames function on the idea 
that you can manipulate things by knowing the syllables that make up 
their truename. Just as my truename would change as I change, so too 
could you change me by changing my truename.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>Is there any relation between truename magic and the True Name (Words of Creation) from <i>Book of Exalted Deeds</i>?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Yes, to a degree. The various power-word
 spells rely on a simple utterance to create a grand effect, and by 
doing so they scratch the surface of truenames. Similarly, the True Name
 (Words of Creation) from <i>Book of Exalted Deeds </i>represent a partial understanding of truenames.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>How would you go about finding 
truenames? Do these affect only creatures (such as those you face in 
combat), or objects as well? That is, what beings possess truenames?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Using truenames requires ranks in the 
Truespeak skill. This represents your character delving deeper into the 
mystery of the universal language. When you use a truename you've 
learned, you make a Truespeak check to pronounce it properly. Truenames 
can affect anything, but you learn names that do specific things. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><b><img src="2006%20-%2003-06%20-%20Tome%20of%20Magic_files/dx0306ps_spotlight_shadow.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="340" width="200"></b>General</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>Were there any particular sources (e.g., real world books, movies, etc.) used when devising pact, shadow and truename magics?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Many sources were used as inspiration, but in all cases we couldn't merely adapt an idea. We took ideas and made them work for <b>D&amp;D</b>--work
 within the concepts the game already presents and for the needs of game
 play. The pact magic section is a good example of this. Everyone has 
heard of the tale of Faust, but the ideas in that story might make an 
interesting adventure, not the foundation for a new class and a bunch of
 new game mechanics. We had to take sources of inspiration and use them 
to make something unique and very <b>D&amp;D</b> while at the same time echoing the ideas that everyone has about those kinds of magic.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>As we saw in <i>Magic of Incarnum</i> and the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>,
 monsters are often created that incorporate new systems. How did you 
come up with the monsters based on these new magic systems?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>The monsters in each section were 
designed to incorporate and reflect the magic the section describes and 
also to fulfill any needs that section might have. For example, for the 
pact magic section, because the vestiges never appear in the flesh, I 
wanted creatures that could bring the strange nature of the vestiges 
into the "physical reality" of a typical <b>D&amp;D</b> game. On the other hand, the shadow magic section provides creatures that can be summoned by casting specific mysteries.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dark Creatures</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Dark creatures dwell on the Plane of Shadow, sometimes 
crossing into other planes where the barriers between dimensions are 
weak. Just as parts of the Plane of Shadow resemble a strange, distorted
 version of the Material Plane, dark creatures superficially resemble 
creatures from the Material Plane. Dark creatures are shadowy, more 
elusive, and spookier than their material counterparts.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wizards:<i></i></b>Is there information for the DM on
 creating their own pacts, shadow, or truename magic, or plans for 
future product support of these systems?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Matthew: </b>Each section provides enough material 
for years of play without the need for more support, but some will 
likely be created. For example, Dragon #341 has an article I authored 
which provides two new vestiges (Kas the Bloody Handed and Primus, the 
One and the Prime), each with a suite of new powers. The book doesn't 
contain any exhaustive advice for DMs about creating new elements for 
the system; we had a tough time fitting what's already in there. Such 
advice might make a good article for the website though...</p>
