<p align="left"><b>Chris Thomasson's Well-Timed Career in D&amp;D</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2003-18%20-%20Sandstorm%20Editor%20Interview_files/sand_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="168" width="135">Prologue to a career: Chris Thomasson's first <b>D&amp;D</b>
 gaming experience came in 1980 at the age of five, when his older 
brother -- desperate for players -- bribed Chris by offering magic items
 galore if Chris would play in his campaign. </p>
<p align="left">"Who could resist a magic sword named Sting?" Chris 
remembers. Yet when, at the family's pastor's urging, the boys' mother 
tossed their <b>D&amp;D</b> books a year later, Chris didn't think about
 the game anymore. He went back to the board games that his grandfather 
favored, and that was the end of his <b>D&amp;D</b> experience. Slowly, 
over time, he rediscovered roleplaying games and trading card games, but
 it took an epiphany to actually bring him into the industry.</p>
<p align="left">Fast-forward nearly twenty years: In his fifth year at 
the University of Washington, closing in on a degree in biology, Chris 
had his moment of clarity: "I was walking back from microbiology when I 
realized . . . I hated it. I didn't want to be a scientist. And I 
couldn't imagine what I wanted to do. But I loved reading . . . I loved 
writing . . . I loved games . . . I thought, 'Doesn't somebody have to 
edit that stuff?' It never even occurred to me that there were <i>designers</i>. I could only think of editors."</p>
<p align="left">Sure enough, there <i>were</i> editors for the games he played at the UW. And once he discovered the editing credits in his <b>Magic: The Gathering</b> rulebooks, he proceeded to get his English degree . . . in one year.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Magazine Drive</b></p>
<p align="left">Just four days before his graduation from college -- and
 without a job lined up, as an editor or otherwise -- Chris came upon a 
posting for an editorial internship at Wizards of the Coast. But the 
deadline for submission was about to close; Chris took no chances and 
elected to drive down to Wizards's Renton facility to hand-deliver his 
resume. When he was finally able to meet with editor-in-chief Beverly 
Marshall Saling, they talked games for two hours. It was serendipity.</p>
<p align="left">"So, in the summer of 1998, I graduated from college on a
 Saturday," Chris recalls, "and on the following Monday, I started work 
at Wizards."</p>
<p align="left">In one capacity or another, he has been with the company
 ever since, always perfecting his craft, always expanding his knowledge
 of the gaming industry, always adding dimensions to the <b>D&amp;D</b> 
game he'd not played since his kindergarten days. When his internship 
ended three months later, he thought his time with Wizards was over . . .
 until, just two weeks before he was to pack up his desk, an editorial 
assistant position opened up on the <i><b>Dungeon</b></i> and <i><b>Dragon</b></i>
 magazines. Just as he seemed about to be unemployed again, he was 
suddenly a full-time employee, one ending on Friday and the other 
beginning the next Monday.</p>
<p align="left">The editorial assistant position became assistant editor, and then associate editor, and ultimately editor-in-chief for <i><b>Dungeon</b></i>. Working closely with Christopher Perkins -- who held numerous editorial positions on <i><b>Dungeon, Dragon,</b> Star Wars Gamer,</i> and <i>Star Wars Insider</i> -- Chris Thomasson became not just a passing fan of the game; he became a pivotal player in <b>D&amp;D</b>'s presentation to the public.</p>
<p align="left">"Third Edition was going on while I was working on the 
magazines," he explains. "Big things were happening. Every month, I'd 
edit sixty pages of material for <i><b>Dungeon</b></i>; I was the only 
editor working on it at the time. The schedules were brutal, but the 
game was evolving, and players were excited about what we were doing, so
 I was excited, too. And before I came to R&amp;D as an editor for <b>D&amp;D</b>, I served as editor-in-chief of <i><b>Dragon</b></i> as well, so I continued to feel that I was really adding something to the game."</p>
<p align="left">Did the breakneck pace inhibit the creative process or necessitate cutting corners? Not in the least. Under Chris's tenure at <i><b>Dungeon</b></i>, fans were treated to some noteworthy examples of Chris's vision for what he could add to <b>D&amp;D</b>: The 100th issue of <b><i>Dungeon</i>,</b> the Incursion project, the <i><b>Dungeon</b></i> Adventure Path. </p>
<p align="left">"For a long time at <b><i>Dungeon</i>,</b> we stayed 
away from the serialized adventures," Chris explains. While subscribers 
wouldn't have any problem keeping up, he points out, players who bought 
the magazine right off the rack could easily miss an issue or two, and 
that would make the whole adventure feel worthless to them. </p>
<p align="left">"But I thought we could do it a little differently," 
Chris says. "Stand-alone modules that built on one another, starting off
 small and culminating in a 'save-the-world' scenario. Put them in a 
neutral setting so anyone could add them to their campaign."</p>
<p align="left">The first installment of the Adventure Path was written,
 appropriately enough, by designer Christopher Perkins ("the most 
prolific designer in <i><b>Dungeon</b></i>'s history," Chris Thomasson 
points out, "by something like a 3-to-1 ratio"), and fan reaction was 
very positive. It ran across multiple issues, and Chris even contributed
 a couple of adventures of his own as it neared the end, though by then 
he had moved on from the magazine.</p>
<p align="left">"It's what I'm most proud of, the Adventure Path," he 
says. "The publisher even began keeping extra back issues around in case
 readers needed to fill the holes in their collections. I really felt 
like it was something cool."</p>
<p align="left">Equally cool: <i><b>Dungeon</b></i> issue #100, which 
Chris describes as "a daunting task." Extra pages, extra adventures . . .
 he wanted it to be big, so he sought out Skip Williams to contribute a <b>Forgotten Realms</b> adventure, and Andy Collins designed a sequel to the cover adventure of <i><b>Dungeon</b></i> issue #1 (which featured the red dragon Flame). Chris also added a major <i><b>Dungeon</b></i>
 retrospective, getting former editors such as Roger Moore, Barbara 
Young, Dave Gross, Chris Perkins, and Wolfgang Bauer to talk about their
 roots at the magazine. The key designers for 3rd Edition, including 
Peter Adkison, Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Rich Baker, all added a 
page or so of adventures. In the end, however, the issue was even bigger
 than he expected when it incorporated the Incursion project, which 
crossed over with <i><b>Dragon</b></i> and <i><b>Polyhedron</b></i> magazines for a first-time-ever multi-magazine arc.</p>
<p align="left">"Christopher Perkins wrote 'The Lich Queen's Beloved,' 
an adventure that even he thinks is one of the best he's ever designed,"
 Chris says. "The characters go to the Astral Plane to fight the Lich 
Queen on her home turf, a brutal but fun adventure. And the Incursion 
crossover made it a rare thing, something that can never happen again 
since the end of <b><i>Polyhedron</i>.</b> Fans loved it, though. It worked out extremely well, and I was proud to have participated in bringing it together."</p>
<p align="left"><b>Career by Design</b></p>
<p align="left">For the last year and a half now, Chris has served as an
 editor for R&amp;D at Wizards of the Coast, his magazine days behind 
him. He has worked on quite a few products in that time as well: <i>Races of Stone</i>, the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i>. The pace is different than when he worked on <i><b>Dungeon</b></i> and <b><i>Dragon</i>,</b> of course.</p>
<p align="left">"Every month on a magazine, it's a lot more pages per 
month, harder deadlines," he explains, "and I did all my own typesetting
 on <b><i>Dungeon</i>.</b> I was a part of the art process and of 
approving sketches and final art -- in essence, the editor's involved 
start to finish. You solicit articles, you work with authors on their 
materials, you work on it all -- design, development, finish. Here, 
there are different teams that handle design and development, so I just 
have to worry about the editing. The schedule is much more stretched 
out, like three months to work on the same project before I hand it off 
to the managing editor. It's long view versus short view. It's much more
 relaxing here, actually."</p>
<p align="left">So, now he works on equally exciting projects. He's helping Kim Mohan finish up <i>Waterdeep</i> for the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> setting. A few weeks ago, he was working on <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>,
 a core book about special magic items that PCs can bond to and that 
grow in power as the PC grows. And beginning in mid-March, he'll begin 
work as the lead editor on the next <b>Eberron</b> project, which is still under wraps.</p>
<p align="left">"My first normal project in quite a while," he concedes,
 "but I'm also one of the three designers of the book with Bruce Cordell
 as the lead designer. I wrote about 40 percent of it, 2 modules, over 
the course of four months. So, I'll be editing myself. Not for the first
 time, of course."</p>
<p align="left">In all, Chris says he's very content with where he is in
 his career. The gaming industry as a whole has been good to him; he 
loves what he does, and he is given numerous opportunities to expand his
 noteworthy talents. He is scheduled to do development work later this 
year, and he is keeping one ear open for any announcement that a <b>D&amp;D</b> video game might come along that he could get in on. </p>
<p align="left">"I haven't even thought about the future in a while 
now," he admits. "From issue to issue of the magazines, I had to think 
about the immediate future. It was always right there. Now I can sit 
back and not feel the pressure and really love what I'm doing. They pay 
me to come in and think and talk about <b>D&amp;D</b> all day long, 
every day. Some jobs just aren't what you think they are until you 
actually get there and do them. This, it turns out, is better than I 
ever expected."</p>
