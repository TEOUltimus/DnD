 book, discuss "mastering the perils of wind and wave." This brand-new 
environmental supplement introduces lots of useful material on 
water-based and shipboard adventures.</p>
<p align="left">In the interests of better involving the player 
community with the features on the D&amp;D website, questions for this 
interview were solicited in part via the <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=444253">message boards</a>.
 Our thanks to the players who go by the screen names Aeolius, The Loose
 Canon, The Morninglord, Andrew, Obrysii, Dark Voivode, MerricB, Ravin 
Ray, Cli' San, Aquanova, Stormanu, Kobold Avenger, Xeviat-DM, Gez, and 
Halornn_Kaala for their participation. New questions are also now being 
solicited for the spotlight on the upcoming <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=6890561"><i>Heroes of Horror</i></a> supplement.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards of the Coast: The tagline for <i>Stormwrack</i>
 reads, "Mastering the Perils of Wind and Wave." Aside from seasickness,
 what hazards and perils might PCs expect from watery environs?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Stephen Schubert:</b> The seas of fantasy worlds are 
filled with all sorts of dangers. For example, seafaring adventurers 
frequently have to deal with whirlpool-like maelstroms that can pull 
ships into their depths and massive sea monsters such as the tentacled 
scyllan (whose image graces the cover art).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What kinds of watery environs can characters
 explore in this book? Can adventures take place beneath the waves as 
well as on the water's surface?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>SS:</b><i> Stormwrack</i> enhances the rules for 
fighting underwater and provides guidelines for creating underwater 
"dungeons." But plenty of space is also devoted to adventuring on the 
high seas and exploring coastal regions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jennifer Clarke Wilkes:</b> Well, in the water there 
are strong currents, hypothermia, the pressure of depth, as well as 
interesting magical and supernatural forms of water. But this isn't just
 a book about being wet; it's also about storms, winds, and the perils 
of adventuring by the shore, not to mention underground rivers and the 
elemental planes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: How does the book cover shipboard 
adventures? Assuming a party could raise enough money, what sorts of 
vessels might be available for purchase? And does the book provide 
guidance on running ship-to-ship naval combat as well as melee aboard 
ship?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>SS:</b> A party wishing to purchase its own ship 
could spend a few thousand gold pieces for a simple cog, a bit more for a
 caravel, or even more for a greatship or elven wingship. And those 
options represent just the tip of the iceberg; many more ships are 
available for purchase. Some of those described in the book even include
 <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mw/20050802a">full deck plans</a>! <i>Stormwrack</i>
 also offers a ship-to-ship combat system designed to replicate the 
maneuvering that takes place before gangplanks are lowered and charges 
are issued.</p>
<p align="left"><b>JCW:</b> Rich Baker has a naval background and was 
very keen on broadening the options for shipboard adventures. He's 
expanded the types of ships available and came up with a simple naval 
combat system.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich Baker:</b> Shipboard adventures are covered 
pretty well. The book contains expanded rules for using existing skills 
to handle various tasks involved with making a voyage -- for example, 
Knowledge (geography) is the place where navigating tasks are handled. 
Profession (sailor) is of course far more useful in a seagoing campaign 
that it is in most landbound games. There's a good discussion of the 
jobs your player characters might hold on a ship, including fantastic 
ones such as the ship's windsinger or ship's mage, and the various 
skills you'll need to stay on course or find your way to new ports.</p>
<p align="left">The new ships introduced in the equipment chapter 
basically offer more variations on the simple "sailing ship" or 
"warship" described in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, and also include a 
couple of more fantastic options, such as the theurgeme (a ship powered 
by a sorcerous engine). And finally, we built a system for dealing with 
fights between two ships. It's pretty impractical to draw a pair of 
ships on your battle map in 5-ft. squares and then erase and reposition 
them every round, so we came up with rules for determining "how far is 
the other ship from me this round?" and "which way am I pointing, which 
way is he pointing?"</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: If I wanted to take on the role of a pirate, what options are available? Does <i>Stormwrack</i>
 provide information on bringing real-world weapons from the Age of 
Piracy -- such as cannons, muskets, and other post-medieval weaponry -- 
into the game?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JCW:</b> It was something I thought about, but because there was an article in <i>Dragon</i> magazine a couple of years ago that covered these sorts of weapons very well, we decided further details weren't necessary.</p>

<p align="left">A creature that seems to be composed of beautiful, sharp
 coral lurches forward on four thick coral legs. Stemming from its core 
are four semi-hollow coral arms bristling with sharp, colorful flanges.</p>
<p align="left">Coral golems are dazzlingly beautiful creatures built to
 guard undersea lairs and sunken treasure troves. They can be 
constructed from coral of any color.</p>
<p align="left">A coral golem stands 20 feet tall but is largely hollow, and it weighs a mere 3,000 pounds.</p>
<p align="left">A coral golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise. It 
moves with a ponderous but smooth gait, and it crackles and crunches 
with each heavy step.</p>
<p align="left">The coral from a destroyed coral golem can be salvaged 
and sold for 500 gp per Hit Die the golem possessed. The coral recovered
 from a destroyed coral golem cannot be used to fashion a new coral 
golem.</p>

<p align="left"><b>SS:</b> Piracy on the high seas is more a way of life than a choice of explosives. <i>Stormwrack</i>
 does not describe massive cannons and twenty-four-gun ships, but a 
number of ships in its pages could be outfitted with bombards -- an 
early form of cannon. Still other ships might be equipped with 
catapults, ballistae, or even the flame-throwing firespout.</p>
<p align="left"><b>RB:</b> We did include information on fairly 
primitive cannons (bombards). We felt that a whole broadside of cannons 
was probably a little anachronistic, but a ship could easily carry a 
couple of bombards in place of a couple of catapults. There's a sidebar 
addressing the question of whether gunpowder, smokepowder (expensive 
alchemical gunpowder) or none at all is available in any particular DM's
 campaign, so it's really in the Dungeon Master's hands. However, we 
decided that we wanted most naval battles to be determined by the 
actions of the PC adventurers onboard, not by simple questions of 
armament, so the rules definitely emphasize magic over technology.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What sorts of creatures can PCs expect to find troubling their waters?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JCW:</b> There is a wide variety of interesting new 
creatures, from gigantic versions of real-world monsters of the deep 
(such as dire eels) to the scyllan, the bizarre sea creature shown on 
the cover; from monsters of myth (sisiutl, a two-headed serpent from 
Northwest Indian legend) to a new kind of fiend, the echinoloth. There 
are also deadly new swarms, including piranha and venomous jellyfish.</p>
<p align="left"><b>SS:</b> The coral golem is one of my favorites from 
the book (though the piranha swarm runs a close second for those 
freshwater adventures). The coral golem is a Huge construct whose 
powerful slams can stun even the hardiest of adventurers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Does the book describe any new races, or any
 aquatic versions of the traditional PC races? What guidelines are 
available for creating seafaring versions of existing races?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>SS:</b><i> Stormwrack</i> offers three brand-new PC 
races -- the Atlantis-inspired aventi, the strong darfellan, and the 
simian hadozee. Furthermore, aquatic elves finally get the treatment 
they deserve as a full-fledged race option. Seafaring variants of the 
traditional races are also provided for those wishing to play 
boat-loving dwarves and expert swimmer halflings.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Wizards: What new magic does <i>Stormwrack</i> bring 
to the game? Does it offer new versions of existing spells designed to 
suit the aquatic environment? What spell or item is your personal 
favorite? (I'd think a living figurehead would make a terrifying hood 
ornament, to say the least!)</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>JCW:</b> Well, I am glad you mentioned living 
figureheads, because I designed several for this book, including a 
dragon figurehead that confers a breath weapon and a kraken figurehead 
to grapple an enemy vessel. There are spells that intensify currents and
 turn water into terrifying new substances, and ways to improve your 
ship or even conjure up a marvelous vessel. There are also some exciting
 epic spells, such as <i>part the waters</i> (this just had to be done).</p>
<p align="left"><b>SS:</b> I'm particularly fond of <i>depthsurge</i> -- a spell that blasts away the water in the area, along with any creatures therein. The spells in <i>Stormwrack</i>
 are all new, designed especially to provide a seafaring wizard or 
cleric with more appropriately themed spells. You're right about the 
living figurehead, though -- just imagine the effect when the dragon's 
head on the prow of your ship unleashes a cone of fire just before you 
ram your enemy!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: Does the book contain any material that conveys the theme of the <i>Stormwrack</i> setting but is useful in other settings as well? In <i>Frostburn</i>,
 for example, the frost mage and primeval prestige classes both display 
the rugged fury of the setting but still function relatively well in 
other environments.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>SS:</b> A number of the items and prestige classes from <i>Stormwrack</i>
 could easily make the transition into other settings. The leviathan 
hunter prestige class, for example, focuses primarily on taking down 
Huge or larger creatures (specifically aberrations, animals, dragons, 
and magical beasts), and such a character would certainly excel in any 
campaign that features nonaquatic versions of those monsters. Likewise, 
the stormcaster prestige class is a good choice for any character who 
wants to master spells that are sonic or electric in nature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>RB:</b> The stormcaster is a good arcane spellcaster class that works well anywhere--it doesn't have to be storms at sea, after all.</p>
