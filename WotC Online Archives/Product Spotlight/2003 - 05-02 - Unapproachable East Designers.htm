<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards
 of the Coast: Obviously, a great deal of research has to go into 
preparing a book that details part of a world already so well developed.
 Was it confining or liberating, having so much previously published 
material to draw from?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt Forbeck:</b>
 Liberating. We had all this great past material to work with, but Rich 
gave us the green light to play with it as much as we liked. He didn't 
want the years of history to weigh the book down. We could keep what 
worked, throw out what didn't, and add all sorts of cool new stuff to 
the mix.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean K. Reynolds:</b> And several of us made it known that we weren't totally happy with how the 2nd edition <i>Spellbound</i>
 boxed set presented Thay (as a place Western adventurers would visit 
and never return to); we wanted it to be a place where you could run a 
native Thayan campaign rather than a one-shot. The same goes for other 
regions in the book (such as Rashemen, which I wrote).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Richard Baker:</b>
 Handling older material is something of a balancing act. First and 
foremost, we want to present the material that the audience expects to 
see about Rashemen, or Thay, or any of those countries. But alongside 
that priority, we need to present material that will make for a great <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game -- usually by introducing source material and "mechanical" 
material that offers lots of potential for play. After all, if we didn't
 do anything except detail Thay or Rashemen again, the consumers could 
rightly ask why in the world we expect them to buy the product. In 
addition to the mechanical information, I also like to make sure that we
 tell you about plenty of new source material, too, so that a book like <i>Unapproachable East</i> does not completely overlap previous products. I think we struck a pretty good balance for <i>Unapproachable East</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What new information can players who've campaigned in the </b>Forgotten Realms<b> for a long time expect to find in<i> Unapproachable East</i>? What from the past has been updated for inclusion?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt:</b> There's a lot of new stuff, but most of what's there is based upon the old <i>Spellbound</i>
 boxed set. It was a great launch pad for the book. From there, we added
 a lot of depth. There are six new races, a dozen new prestige classes, 
and fistfuls of new feats, spells, magic items, and monsters.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 We tried to give these regions the same sort of "let's run a game here"
 detail that Waterdeep and the Dalelands got in the older books. From 
the get-go we had some ideas for country-themed prestige classes based 
on what we knew of the region and what we wanted to do with it, such as 
the Durthan prestige class (evil counterparts of the hathrans) and the 
Shou Disciple prestige class (for Theskan fighter-types who have learned
 some elements of Kara-Turan unarmed fighting styles without actually 
taking levels in the monk class).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Rich:</b> I'm particularly proud of the "mechanical" material. It's strongly rooted in <i>Unapproachable East</i>, but it's good stuff all on its own. For example, the book introduces the race of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20030502a&amp;page=3">hagspawns</a><span style=" color:#800080;"></span>--
 the sons of hags. Hags take human males for mates, and their female 
children become the next generation of hags. Their male children are 
hagspawns, strong and hardy loners who make good fighters and wizards.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">In
 terms of source material, there's a lot more here on the Great Dale and
 Thesk than we've ever presented before. And there's some nice weaving 
of old threads that help to pull together things like Aglarond's 
history, the continuing sinister influence of ancient Narfell and 
Raumauthar, and a better picture of the geography of Thay than we've 
previously published.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What was the creative process like?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt:</b>
 As the developer, Rich came up with an outline for the book, lined up 
the writers, and then parceled out the work. As I recall, Sean turned in
 his chapter on Rashemen first, which was a great model for me to 
follow. I wrote a big chunk of the book after that. Then Rich took what 
we'd turned in, added a ton of his own material, and polished the whole 
thing to a mirror finish.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 Rich had to shoulder a big load for this book, as about two-thirds of 
the way through the design process we were told that the book was going 
to be made bigger and needed more "crunchy" game material. So Rich sat 
down to create 32 more pages of rules in addition to cleaning up the 
material the other designers turned over. I gave him a few suggestions 
based on stuff I was going to recommend for a web enhancement, so the 
book should satisfy both sides of the gaming spectrum (fans of rules and
 fans of source material).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Rich:</b>
 I wore three hats for this book: designer, developer, and creative 
director. In terms of design, my chief contribution was in the early 
"crunchy" chapters, which turned out to be closer to 80 pages. As 
developer, I went over Sean and Matt's material and made sure it all 
hung together and was as good as it could be. And as creative director, I
 oversaw the process of outlining, coordinating with our art director 
and cartographers, and getting the material playtested. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards:
 The new prestige classes are quite impressive, the new monsters are 
awesome, and the detail about the various realms is amazing. What parts 
of the book excite you? What are you most proud of?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Rich:</b>
 Well, I mentioned the hagspawns already. I'm generally happy with the 
whole book. I suppose my favorite prestige class would be the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20030502a&amp;page=2">Nar demonbinder</a>, a spellcaster who specializes in calling and binding evil outsiders.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b> The <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 setting is great for making prestige classes because there is so much 
culture to help define and color them. The same goes for regional feats,
 too, and it was fun (if tough) to make a berserker feat for each of the
 Rashemen berserker lodges. I also enjoyed converting some of the 2nd 
edition <i>Spellbound</i> monsters to 3rd edition monsters and templates.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt:</b>
 I really got a kick out of digging into the various nations and 
building the personalities behind them. Detailing some of the Red 
Wizards of Thay was fun, and working on the Simbul and her homeland of 
Aglarond was a kick, too.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: How do you playtest this sort of material? </b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt:</b>
 It's impossible to playtest the background material. It either works 
with the rest of the background or it doesn't. Wizards used a team of 
in-house playtesters to fiddle with the crunchier bits to get them just 
right.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sean:</b>
 One of the concerns raised by the in-house playtesters was balancing 
the PCs appropriately against the monsters, so I provided a "standard" <b>Forgotten Realms</b><i>Unapproachable East</i>
 adventuring party, which included a couple of barbarians instead of 
fighters, and a more monk-like fighter (from Thesk) that also served as a
 rogue, to reflect how a party centered in the Unapproachable East would
 have a different class balance than a standard party.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Rich:</b> We playtest as much as we can. In the case of <i>Unapproachable East</i>,
 we conducted some character-creation playtests to check out the new 
races and options, and some monster-bashes to check the Challenge 
Ratings of our new monsters. We had an opportunity to do something 
special in the playtesting of this product: A few months back we 
entertained a guest from the Make-a-Wish Foundation and gave him a 
chance to run a character in our <i>Unapproachable East</i> playtests.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Oh
 -- one more thing I need to mention: I just peeked at the credits page,
 and realized that we seem to have left Penny Williams and Jon Pickens 
off the list of playtesters. D'oh! Sorry about that.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Wizards: What are you working on now?</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Matt:</b> I just took a job as the director of the new adventure games division at <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.humanhead.com&amp;origin=dnd_ps_20030502a">Human Head Studios</a>,
