<p align="left">In the interests of better involving the player community with the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, questions for this interview were solicited in part via the <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=8311457">message boards</a>. Our thanks to the following players: </p>
<p align="left">Chrys, Lord Thavian, Kadasbrass, Zuxius, Dordledum, 
Ackrus, ThatGuyDann, jdarksong, Monsoon28, Carolan, pileobone, Meds,

<p align="left"><b>Wizards of the Coast: </b>What classifies <i>Red Hand of Doom </i>as a super-adventure?</p>
<p align="left"><b>James Jacobs: </b>The size, I suppose; it's huge! Not
 only that, but its plot is equally epic; the PCs aren't simply trying 
to slay a single dragon or recover an artifact--they're taking on an 
entire army.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich Baker: </b>It makes a pretty good campaign all 
by itself. Depending on how often you play, you should be able to get 6 
months of regular adventuring out of Red Hand of Doom. We designed it to
 play out in about 20 to 25 sessions, although it might easily run a few
 more if you use all of the floating encounters in addition to the 
site-based encounters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>What party level is the adventure designed for--and are PCs expected to rise throughout/by the end?</p>
<p align="left"><b>James: </b>The PCs start at 5th level, and by the 
time they get to the end they'll be 10th or 11th. In addition, we took 
into account that certain things happen at specific levels and tried to 
incorporate those into the adventure; for example, at about the point 
the PCs reach 6th level (and can for the first time take the Leadership 
feat) we built in some encounters wherein the PCs can meet prospective 
cohorts.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><b>Sample Designers' Notes</b></p>
<p align="left">The treasure in the Vraath Vault is a significant one for PCs of this level, even without the <i>staff of life</i>.
 This is intentional; there's not a lot of treasure to be found 
elsewhere in this part of the adventure aside from the gear owned by 
Wyrmlord Koth and his minions. Thus, the Vraath Vault stash is a way of 
making up for light treasure elsewhere in this part. If it seems like 
the players are going to overlook the treasure, you might want to subtly
 encourage them to take a good look around the place before they leave.</p>
<p align="left">The <i>staff of life</i> is here to serve as adventure 
insurance. The PCs won't have much time to seek out high-level clerics 
during this adventure, and there aren't many in the western end of the 
vale anyway. Giving out a <i>staff of life</i> near the start of the 
adventure is a way to help the PCs survive the tough challenges that lie
 ahead. If you feel that your PC party doesn't need this much help, 
replace the staff with a <i>wand of cure moderate wounds</i> that has 44 charges.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b><i>Red Hand of Doom </i>includes a 
number of Designer Notes, speaking directly to the DM about how a given 
encounter may be played out. What was the rationale for their inclusion?
 And are such notes things we can expect in future adventures? </p>
<p align="left"><b>James: </b>This is the first time, that I know of, 
that WotC's done anything like this; I'm eager to see how the fans react
 to it. These notes are intended not only to provide advice on how to 
run a particularly tough encounter, but to explain why we made some of 
the decisions we made. In addition, they provide an insight into <i>how</i>
 adventures are designed, and should hopefully help DMs to design their 
own adventures. Think of them as analogous to a DVD's director 
commentary. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich: </b>Our adventure formats have been pretty 
rigorous in 3rd Edition. We decided we wanted to open up the design a 
bit and make an adventure that was friendlier and less work for the DM 
to run. We think the Designer Notes are one small step we can take in 
that direction. Let us know what you think about them! </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b><i>Red Hand of Doom</i> is hailed as the first core <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure in recent years (as opposed to within a <i>Forgotten Realms</i> or <i>Eberron</i> setting); does this mean that it may be set within any group's campaign, or is there specific geography that it depicts? </p>
<p align="left"><b>James: </b>The events in the adventure occur in a 
fairly large geographic region called the Elsir Vale. This region should
 fit quite well into any <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign; we provide some tips in the adventure itself on how best to adjust things for <i>Greyhawk</i>, <i>Forgotten Realms</i>, and <i>Eberron</i>
 in particular. The adventure itself is pretty much self-contained in 
this region, which makes it really easy to insert into a larger campaign
 world without worrying about ties to other nations or regions. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>Aside from larger issues of geography, 
what terrain types will PCs adventure through? How are the 
miniatures-ready maps coordinated with the adventure (and are there any 
miniatures tie-ins with the forthcoming <i>War Drums</i> expansion)? </p>
<p align="left"><b>James: </b>The Elsir Vale is temperate, although the 
adventure takes place during a hot, muggy summer. The PCs will find 
themselves in small towns and sprawling cities at either end of the 
adventure, and in between they'll visit pastoral valleys, tangled 
forests, rugged mountains, and monster-infested swamps. My favorite 
terrain, though, has to be the tangled badlands the PCs have to navigate
 in order to reach one of the campaign's primary dungeons. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Red%20Hand%20of%20Doom_files/dx0210ps_rhodspotlight_1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="261" width="200">There
 are three locations mapped out in miniatures scale, each from 
encounters that are particularly combat-intensive. When you get to one 
of these encounters, you just throw down the map and have at it. As for <i>War Drums</i>;
 several of the minis in this set were selected specifically from 
monsters we used in the adventure but didn't yet have corresponding 
miniatures; in a way, Rich and I got to influence the direction of the 
monster choices for this set. I can't wait to see how some of them turn 
out... </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich: </b>Forest, swamp, and thorny scrubland spring 
to mind. Plus, you may spend a fair amount of time fighting in towns and
 villages that are currently being overrun or attacked by the Red Hand 
horde. Some of the adversaries you may see as miniatures include the 
Doom Fist monk, the Blood Ghost berserker, the Kulkor Zhul sorcerer, and
 the hobgoblin warpriest. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>Getting down to the adversaries: Who exactly is the namesake Red Hand?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich: </b>OK, here's a little spoiler: The Red Hand 
is a symbol for the cult of Tiamat. Five taloned digits represent five 
dragon heads. The army of Azarr Kull carries the emblem of the Red Hand 
as their battle-standard... hence the name Red Hand of Doom. (My 
colleague David Noonan directed my attention to a Solomon Kane story by 
Robert E. Howard named Right Hand of Doom after we'd settled on the 
adventure name. I went off and read the story, and found to my relief 
that there is no resemblance between the story and the plot of our 
adventure. Whew!)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>Throughout the adventure, what sorts of 
challenges will PCs face while squaring off against the horde? Were 
there any particularly favorite enemies you devised that you wouldn't 
mind seeing get off a good shot or two before falling to worthy heroes?</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><b>Wyrmlord Ulwai Stormcaller CR 9</b></p>
<p align="left">Female hobgoblin bard 5/stormsinger 4</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gust of Wind (Sp) </b>Ulwai can create a gust of wind (caster level 10th, or 12th if she is in a storm) by expending one use of bardic music.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Thunderstrike (Su)</b> Ulwai can use bardic music to 
unleash a deadly thunderbolt on any one creature within 60 feet. She 
must make a +10 ranged touch attack to hit her target. If she hits, she 
makes a Perform (sing) check, and the result indicates how much 
electricity damage the thunderbolt deals (d20+15, or d20+17 if she is in
 a storm). A DC 17 Reflex save halves this damage. If the creature fails
 the save, it must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened</p>
<p align="left">for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt.</p>

<p align="left"><b>James: </b>The primary monster you'll face in the 
adventure are goblinoids; hobgoblins mostly. Most of them have quite a 
few class levels too, including some prestige classes from sources like <i>Frostburn</i> and <i>Complete Arcane</i>.
 But there's a lot more in the adventure than just hobgoblins. One of 
our goals in the design was to replace army commanders (roles that might
 otherwise have been filled by just more powerful hobgoblins) with more 
specialized monsters like minotaurs or giants. Whenever we had a chance,
 we mixed things up by adding non-humanoid foes. We've also introduced a
 new type of monster: the spawn of Tiamat. </p>
<p align="left">As for a personal favorite enemy, I think I'd have to 
nominate Ulwai Stormcaller. She's not the toughest villain in the 
adventure, but she's got some really cool tricks and tactics that might 
just make some jaded players sit up and say, "A bard did WHAT?" </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>By the climax of the adventure, PCs will
 be going up against Azarr Kul, the High Wyrmlord; what connections does
 the Wrymlord have with, say, the Mother of all Dragons, Tiamat? </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich: </b>Azarr Kull is a powerful champion of 
Tiamat--he's the leader of the Red Hand cult, and Tiamat's chosen 
emissary in this corner of the world. One of the little twists we threw 
into the adventure was the idea that a large and powerful hobgoblin 
realm might choose to worship Tiamat rather than Maglubiyet or the rest 
of the goblin pantheon. Tiamat is lawful evil, just like hobgoblins, and
 she certainly passes the test as a deity of war, destruction, and 
tyranny--all things that hobgoblins aspire to as well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>Do you play in each other's campaigns? 
Were there any notable encounters from your own running of the module? 
Is there any advice you'd give to players preparing to attempt the 
adventure (and/or for DMs preparing to run it)?</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Red%20Hand%20of%20Doom_files/dx0210ps_rhodspotlight_2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="185" width="264"><b>Rich: </b>I haven't had the pleasure of playing much <b>D&amp;D</b>
 with James, but we both play regularly in our own games. I ran the 
first part of the adventure over the summer in my home game, and I also 
had another group of Wizards of the Coast R&amp;D types run the 
adventure in their own game. We discovered the hard way that the first 
dragon the players meet during the adventure was, well, too big. It ate a
 couple of parties in the early playtests. We also discovered that a 
surprisingly small number of otherwise educated and capable players know
 how hydras work in 3.5, which made an encounter I considered routine 
into a real party-mauler. </p>
<p align="left">One other bit of advice: We frankly assume that your 
party includes a spellcaster with good area-of-effect spells. If you're 
going to play this adventure without a lightning bolt or fireball 
available (maybe your arcane spellcaster is a warlock, or an enchanter, 
or a necromancer), you may want to invest in the appropriate wands or 
scrolls.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>Are there plans to continue <i>Red Hand of Doom's</i>
 story in future adventures? It's been a long time since Wizards 
published a big adventure; what lessons did you take away (either 
positive or negative) from <i>City of the Spider Queen</i> and <i>Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil</i>? </p>
<p align="left"><b>James: </b>The story told in Red Hand of Doom is 
pretty self-contained. That said, it does give the PCs the dubious honor
 of attracting the attention of Tiamat herself, and the chromatic dragon
 certainly won't forget them. It'd be cool to see a big follow-up 
adventure wherein the survivors of <i>Red Hand of Doom</i> get to invade Hell and take on Tiamat, wouldn't it? </p>
<p align="left">I didn't have much to do with <i>City of the Spider Queen</i> or <i>Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil</i>, but working on <i>Dungeon</i> (and in particular, the <i>Shackled City</i> and <i>Age of Worms</i>
 Adventure Paths) taught me a lot about designing huge adventures. One 
of the most important lessons I've learned there: don't succumb to the 
lure of the <i>enormous</i> dungeon. They may be fun to design, but 
dungeons with 100 rooms are a bear to adventure through. I tried to keep
 the dungeons in <i>Red Hand of Doom</i> fairly small (no more than 25 
rooms, and in some cases much less) and took pains to give each of them a
 unique theme, feel, and flavor. I didn't want PCs exploring the sunken 
city of Rhest to mistake the dungeon for the Ghostlord's Lion or the 
Fane of Tiamat. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich: </b>James already mentioned one of the lessons 
we learned: Too many NPCs in the same encounter isn't always great. We 
tried to find places to eliminate "middle-tier" guys like sergeants, 
lesser priests, or specialists with monsters. Critters like hell hounds,
 giants, or worgs are simpler to run than your third or fourth different
 type of leveled-up goblinoid in the same fight. We think that this 
makes for some more interesting and varied fights, because not every bad
 guy is a goblinoid with a sword or a spell. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards: </b>Were there any influences you had in 
creating the adventure? Looking back, any favorite adventures from 
previous editions, either running as a DM or playing through? </p>
<p align="left"><b>James: </b>Of course, the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> movies (in particular, <i>Return of the King</i>) were fresh in my mind while working on <i>Red Hand of Doom</i>,
 so I'd be lying if I said these movies had no impact on my design 
choices. Chris Thomasson's adventure "Foundations of Flame" (in <i>Dungeon</i> #113 and the <i>Shackled City</i>
 hardcover campaign) was also quite inspiring in its methods of 
presenting encounters in a city in the throes of a calamity. I suppose 
there's a bit of <i>World of Warcraft</i> in there too, especially in 
Part Two... I've been playing that game too much for it not to get its 
talons into everything else I do. </p>
<p align="left">As for favorite adventures from previous editions, I'd have to say my all time favorite is one of the first super adventures: <i>Queen of the Spiders</i>. I've run that thing at least three times, and had more fun running it each time I reran it. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rich: </b>My initial vision for the adventure was to 
take my best swing at a challenge that comes up in countless fantasy 
novels: the Army of Evil is trying to conquer everything. A lot of 
adventures use an orc horde as backdrop and motivation, but then make 
the heroes go off and do "standard" dungeon-delving to find the McGuffin
 that will then defeat the horde. I wanted to create an adventure that 
cast the heroes in the role of "captains of good," doing things that 
directly affected the course of the war. So, the heroes face crucial 
tests in rallying allies, helping the local rulers to determine 
strategy, spying on the Red Hand horde and scouting its movements, and 
directly confronting the bad guys on the battlefield. Some of that 
involves old-fashioned dungeon-delving, but a lot of the adventure takes
 the heroes back and forth across the landscape, doing a hundred 
different things to stop the Red Hand march. I think you have to go back
 to Bloodstone Pass to find a <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure that provides the PCs with this kind of challenge. </p>
