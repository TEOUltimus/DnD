<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards of the Coast: What was the initial goal behind the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>? Did it spring from the pre-existing widespread use of miniatures in the game?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan Tweet</b>: The <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> and the <b>D&amp;D</b> Miniatures line in general developed because we saw that miniatures were a big part of the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 roleplaying experience. We wanted to support players who use miniatures
 in their games, as well as create easy-to-use miniatures for players 
who would like to use miniatures but don't. In addition, we built on the
 experience Wizards has with competitive games. Our <b>D&amp;D</b> 
miniatures are designed to work in a roleplaying game, but we've also 
created a head-to-head skirmish system for fighting fast, tactical 
battles with them. The<i> Miniatures Handbook</i>, like the miniatures themselves, supports both roleplaying and head-to-head wargaming.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards: As members of the team behind the book, do you feel miniatures are already an indispensable part of the game?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rob Heinsoo</b>:
 Now that I can grab a handful of orcs and lizardfolk and pop them into 
the pocket of my jacket along with an umber hulk and an ogre, drive to 
my <b>D&amp;D</b> game and pull the minis out of my jacket pocket when I need to put them on the table . . . <i>these</i> miniatures are indispensable in my <b>D&amp;D</b> games. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards: The <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> has new characters, spells, magic items, feats, and monsters. How do these relate to miniatures?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>: For the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>,
 we created characters, creatures, and other elements that we wanted to 
see in the miniatures line. For example, we created a healer class, the 
warhulk prestige class, and the aspect of Demogorgon because we wanted 
to see those as miniatures. (Miniatures of the healer, warhulk, and 
aspect of Demogorgon are on their way.) But even for the DM or player 
who doesn't have the miniatures, the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> is loaded with good stuff to add to a <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rob</b>: Not all the new stuff in the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> will show up in miniatures right away. <b>D&amp;D</b>
 has so many cool creatures, characters, and classes to make miniatures 
of that it will take many sets to fit in most of the material from the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 What are players going to find that's new? For instance, you have some 
very intriguing and terrifying new monsters in the aspects.</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>: <b>D&amp;D</b>
 players will find a lot of new stuff in the first few chapters of the 
book. In addition to the new classes and monsters already mentioned, 
there are new feats, spells, and magic items. Included among the feats 
are sudden metamagic feats, which let a spellcaster boost a few spells 
every day on the spot, without preparing them ahead of time. Spells 
include more conjurations, which are good against monsters with spell 
resistance. There are also a number of spells that require a "swift 
action" to cast. Basically, they're like spells that come 
"pre-quickened." There are new spells for everyone, including rangers, 
paladins, shadowdancers, and assassins. For instance, there's a 
2nd-level spell for assassins and bards called "swift invisibility." 
It's an invisibility spell that takes "no time" to cast and makes you 
invisible for one round.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards: Can you outline how the stat cards work? </span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>: Every <b>D&amp;D</b> miniature comes with a stat card. One side has the creature's regular <b>D&amp;D </b>statistics, and the other side has its streamlined statistics for use in the skirmish system. The <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> details how to use both sides of the stat card, and how to convert regular <b>D&amp;D</b> scores into skirmish-system statistics.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 stat cards are designed to be compact but easy to use during play. You 
can even use the random dungeon rules and turn your cards into a system 
for generating random encounters.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 Also quite significant are the new rules for mass battles and 
skirmishes. What's the most fundamental difference in the rules between 
the two types of combat?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan: </b>The
 skirmish rules are designed to be fast, with several miniatures in each
 warband. Skirmishes are played on a grid, so that players can move and 
place their creatures faster. Fast battles mean that it's easy to play 
several skirmishes, such as in a tournament. The mass battles rules are 
for the fun and spectacle of big battles, with lots of miniatures on 
each side. These battles take place on a tabletop with rulers to measure
 distance. Mass battles take longer to play out, so a full-scale mass 
battle is a major event.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 What sorts of playtests did you conduct for the two different sets of 
combat rules? What did you find most difficult to design as a result?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>:
 The mass battles rules draw on playtests that actually go back several 
years to when Wizards was working on a set of mass battles rules 
independent from <b>D&amp;D</b>. Since then, Wizards bought <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>, and those original ideas were incorporated into the mass battles rules in the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 skirmish rules are not only based on heavy playtesting devoted to this 
project, but also are informed by all the playtesting and player 
feedback from <i>Chainmail</i>. <i>Chainmail</i> was a skirmish game based on <b>D&amp;D</b>,
 so a lot of what we learned with that game (both from our successes and
 from our mistakes) wound up pointing us in the right direction with the
 new skirmish rules.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 the mass battles rules, the big challenge was how to incorporate 
commanders into the system. Obviously, commanders are important for an 
army's success, but an individual commander has less direct effect on 
combat in a big battle game than in a skirmish. We developed a system 
that lets a commander lead "from the front" of a unit, which gives the 
unit advantages but puts the commander at risk. Alternatively, 
commanders can lead "from the rear," where they are safer but unable to 
contribute to combat.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The command rules were also the most challenging part of the skirmish system. While spells and combat derive directly from the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 rules, the command rules are all new. Commanders had to be important 
enough that they would be key to your victory, but not so important that
 a player whose commander is killed has no chance of winning. Striking 
the right balance took a lot of playtesting.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rob</b>:
 We wanted the skirmish command system to be tactically interesting 
during play while staying simple. We tried several systems during 
playtesting and used the one we enjoyed the most, a system that allows 
basic command by line-of-sight <i>and</i> that gives commanders powerful
 commander effects that help followers within 6 squares of the 
commander. The resulting system makes it fairly easy to keep creatures 
under command, if you build your warband properly. But your opponent can
 complicate that by attacking your commander. And you won't get the full
 benefit of your commander's commander effect unless you keep the 
commander near the rest of your creatures, which increases your 
commander's risk. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wizards: People have been asking for years for a mass battles system for </b>D&amp;D<b>, and now it's here. What style of battle were you looking for as you designed it?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>: Our central goal was to be true to <b>D&amp;D</b>. In a lot of ways, <b>D&amp;D</b>
 is about heroes, monsters, and special abilities (including spells). So
 we built a solid system for units of mundane soldiers beating on each 
other, but we took pains to incorporate the key aspects of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game play as well. Heroic commanders bolster the troops that they lead.
 Mighty monsters, alone or in small groups, serve as shock troops. 
Wizards and clerics use spells to bring down the enemy and protect their
 own forces. While tight formations of regular troops play a key role, 
we wanted a <b>D&amp;D</b> mass battle to look like <b>D&amp;D</b>, with
 all the monsters, spells, and powerful characters that D&amp;D players 
expect. The trick was balancing the rules so that powerful individuals 
contributed to an army's victory without dominating the battlefield.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards:
 The art for this book is already becoming legendary -- particularly the
 sketch-to-photograph comparisons. Tell us a little about the art.</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>: Putting art into the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> was a joy. Original art is a major expense when we produce a <b>D&amp;D</b> book, but with the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>
 we were able to use loads of black-and-white concept sketches as well 
as color photos of the finished miniatures. And that's in addition to 
the numerous color diagrams and the original art we commissioned 
especially for the book. In fact, we had to tighten up the text a bit to
 make sure we had room for all that art.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For the record, the miniatures that we depict in the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>
 are the real deal. They're basically what you get yourself when you pop
 open an expansion pack. We didn't touch them up or repaint them to make
 them look better. The actual miniatures are really that good.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards: How are the concept sketches created in the first place?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>: Since this is a line of <b>D&amp;D</b> miniatures, the concept sketches are drawn straight from <b>D&amp;D</b>
 sources. For example, the images of iconic characters such as Vadania 
are well established. The concept sketch for the Vadania miniature in 
Harbinger is based on how she appears in various <b>D&amp;D</b> books. Just as the creatures' statistics are drawn straight from <b>D&amp;D</b>, their concepts sketches are too.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rob</b>:
 Most of our miniatures have more new concept work done on them than 
iconic characters like Vadania. For most miniatures, the pattern is that
 we write art suggestions and design game statistics to match the art 
suggestion. Occasionally the finished art inspires us to modify the 
stats. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With the <i>Miniatures Handbook,</i>
 we had a great opportunity to plant the images that we in turn wanted 
to use for miniatures. For example, what could be cooler than a 
miniature of a samurai in draconic armor? To provide for that miniature,
 we wrote up the dragon samurai prestige class for <b>D&amp;D</b> and put it in the classes section of the <i>Miniatures</i><i>Handbook</i>. Once the dragon samurai became a <b>D&amp;D</b>
 class, we were able to work up concept sketches based on the class 
description. Not only with classes but also with creatures, the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i> gave us a chance to create cool new things for <b>D&amp;D</b> that we can now release as miniatures.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 some of the monsters, however, we let the artists have a lot of leeway.
 For example, we wanted a gaze-attack monster whose gaze attack wouldn't
 be as lethal as the basilisk's or medusa's gazes, and we wanted it to 
look really good. So we gave an artist a general description of the 
monster but let the artist envision and sketch it. When you give artists
 free rein, you can get some great images. That creature, the one-eyed 
nothic, is in turn getting made into a miniature for an upcoming set, 
and the monster makes a good addition to a DM's stable of creatures even
 without the miniature.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Wizards
 of the Coast: The Random Dungeon chapter that demonstrates how to use 
stat cards to generate random encounters is a stroke of genius. Who gets
 the credit for this innovation, and how did it play the first time it 
was tested?</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jonathan</b>:
 The work we do in R&amp;D is really a team effort. I came up with the 
system, but I wouldn't have done so without input from Mike Donais and 
others. The first dungeon along these lines was actually put together 
not using our stat cards but instead using monster tokens made out of 
glass beads, produced by a small company run by a friend of mine. We 
pulled beads out of a bag instead of drawing cards from a deck. The very
 first dungeon crawl we ran was pretty amazing, with lots of action, a 
sense of growing danger, and a climactic battle with the chief villain 
and a horde of minions. The PCs were all killed, but it was fun.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So for the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>, we developed a similar system that uses <b>D&amp;D</b>
 stat cards. That way, you have the stats you need in front of you as 
you play. When we played with beads, we used a really streamlined system
 for the monsters' stats. With cards, you can play full-on <b>D&amp;D</b> with all the crunchy monster stats.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Personally, I've used the random dungeon system as a filler when my Wednesday night game group doesn't have a regular <b>D&amp;D </b>session ready to go. One time we ran our <b>D&amp;D</b>
 characters from a new campaign through the dungeon. It was a way to 
test the characters out, see how powerful they were, and get a better 
sense for how they could work together.</span></p>
