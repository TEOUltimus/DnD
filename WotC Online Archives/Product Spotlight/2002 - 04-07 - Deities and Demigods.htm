<p class="size2">In this month's exclusive interview, the designers of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881650000">Deities and Demigods</a></i> discuss creating the rules for creating gods, worshipping gods, and becoming gods.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards of the Coast: In the beginning... were you 
worried about tackling the inevitably controversial subject of the 
appropriateness of gods in roleplaying games? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich Redman:</b> We made a decision early on that we
 were presenting game-focused pantheons, religious systems that worked 
for characters in D&amp;D, not trying to replicate real-world religions.
 That decision eliminated any worry I had about the topic. Unless you're
 Tolkien, it's very difficult to write medieval fantasy material without
 making religion, and deities, active parts of the story. If you study 
history, you find that religion was a vital part of everyday life. So to
 me it's entirely appropriate. The only issue is respecting the cultures
 and religions we use for inspiration.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>James Wyatt:</b> For some reason, I've never had a 
problem completely disentangling my own faith from the necessity for 
realistic religions in fantasy games, and I didn't give it a second 
thought as I started in working on <i>Deities and Demigods</i> (except 
to wonder if I was being typecast again...). In fact, maybe it's because
 of my own faith that I put so much emphasis on developing religions for
 my own games: I want the characters in my games to have something to 
put their trust in. Though I've experimented with both approaches, I 
think in many ways using a fictional or legendary pantheon is a "safer" 
tactic than trying to represent my own religion in game terms.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: How did you decide what to retain for this book from previous editions and what to leave out? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> As I recall, we never thought about it. We
 chose certain pantheons based on our perception of what mythologies 
were most commonly adapted for game use by our players. So the decision 
of what to include was independent of previous editions.</p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2004-07%20-%20Deities%20and%20Demigods_files/deities_1e_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="210" width="179"><b>James:</b> This book owes a lot to the 1st Edition <i>Deities and Demigods</i>/<i>Legends and Lore</i>
 book, more so than the 2nd Edition version. However, the new material 
we introduced meant that we had a lot less room to include the variety 
of pantheons included in the earlier version. So we chose the pantheons 
that we felt were (a) most popular and (b) most ensconced in the popular
 culture of fantasy: the Greek, Norse, and Egyptian. It stung a bit to 
leave out the Celtic deities, but we just didn't have the space.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: For DMs familiar with previous versions of this book, what will they find that's new in<i> Deities and Demigods</i>? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Wow, tons. We decided not to hide anything
 from the DM. We provide all the information a DM needs to create his or
 her own pantheons and individual deities. We provide complete 
information on the deities as characters. We discuss roleplaying 
deities, divine ascension so player characters can become deities, and 
we provide advice on how often deities should get involved in mortal 
affairs. It's not just a reference book for clerics -- it's a way to 
make deities active participants in your game.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip Williams:</b> Right. The first thing I think 
you'll notice is those statistics for the deities -- not just for the 
avatars, but for the deities themselves. (The current game is perfectly 
capable of supporting a deity's stats, so we put them in. If that 
doesn't sit well with you, you can always treat the listed stats as the 
stats for as super-avatar.)</p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Again, [you'll find] much more 
information on creating your own pantheons, creating religions that 
don't rely on the D&amp;D-standard pantheon of deities (such as 
monotheistic or dualistic religions), adapting the game cosmology to the
 religious system, and making religion come to life in the game. I'd 
like to claim credit for a lot of that sort of material, but Skip and 
Rich contributed a lot as well. Still, my background in the academic 
study of religion really helped me flesh out my parts of that material.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: The D&amp;D pantheon is given its own 
chapter, which was a very pleasant surprise. What was the process for 
establishing the specific deities of the D&amp;D cosmology?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip:</b> That goes back to the design for the 
current game. The design team adapted existing deities from the Greyhawk
 pantheon for the core pantheon. We tried to make sure that all the 
class, race, and alignment combinations were covered. Once these deities
 were part of the core pantheon, it was a no-brainer to examine them in 
detail.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: I would guess that the rules for divine 
ascension were particularly challenging to establish. But it's certainly
 a vital part of high-level campaigns. What were the challenges in 
designing the rules that govern ascension?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Because I had access to various incarnations of the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881690000">epic-level rules</a>,
 I tried very hard to make divine ascension work with them. Beyond that,
 I found divine ascension was a natural extension of the way some 
religions function. The challenge really lies in what happens after a 
character ascends. What if one character ascends and the rest of the 
party doesn't? What kind of adventures do you run for deities? I took my
 best shot at addressing those concerns.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip:</b> Since D&amp;D is a game of heroes, not 
gods, we settled for a brief discussion of the process for DMs and 
players who might be interested. A true set of divine ascension rules 
would require a book all by itself.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: How did the new edition of the game change your approach to assembling the gods and demigods? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> We had to do a lot more math.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip:</b> The biggest change was being able to give 
gods real game statistics. Beyond that, we had to make sure that the 
pantheons we presented were complete and playable, so that they could 
indeed support a campaign.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> The 3rd Edition toolbox is a great set of
 rules for doing what we did. We worked closely with Andy Collins as he 
was developing the essential rules for the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> to
 make sure that the deities work as game-legal 60th-level characters. 
That's just never happened before: The deity stats in the 1st Edition 
book made no sense as consistent characters in the 1st Edition rules. 
The divine salient abilities work in a manner similar to feats (and in 
fact, when the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> comes out, players will be 
pleased to see feats that let them do many of the things that deities 
can do). I think those rules have a very "3E feel" to them.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: What was left on the "cutting room floor"? In other words, what did you really want to include but had to discard? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Well, I already mentioned the Celtic 
pantheon, which we knew at the outset we wouldn't have room for. I 
trimmed some deities from the traditional D&amp;D representation of the 
Egyptian pantheon with no regrets in order to produce what I think is a 
more coherent pantheon. I would have liked to include an all-new fantasy
 pantheon as well, to show another example of building a pantheon from 
scratch starting from some different assumptions than the D&amp;D 
pantheon. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip:</b> In terms of the nuts of bolts of gods, we 
cut almost nothing. As noted earlier, we did not attempt to make gods 
playable as PCs. And there were, of course, many individual gods that 
didn't get space in the book.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Why did you determine that these bits needed to be cut?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Mostly, though, the cuts happened in 
advance, as it were: we knew in advance we just wouldn't have room for 
some things we would have liked to put in.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards:</b><b>How do multiple designers work together on such a vast project? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip:</b> In this case, the effort involved creating
 a detailed outline, then dividing up the work. Because I was first to 
spend time on the project, many of nitty-gritty game details fell to me.
 There was indeed much trading of ideas and rough drafts, not just with 
the design team, but with everyone on the R&amp;D staff who had an 
interest in the project.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Yes, Skip and I started first. We had a 
number of fairly long meetings to discuss what features separated a 
deity from a mortal. We shared that information with James and 
established a format for deity stat blocks, and then we divided the 
pantheons amongst ourselves and went to work on them. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> Once the groundwork was laid, we each 
went our own ways in writing the sections we were assigned: Skip did the
 D&amp;D pantheon and half of the Olympians (Greeks), I did the 
Pharaonics (Egyptian), the other half of the Olympians, and the 
"miscellaneous deities" in Chapter 7, and Rich did the Asgardians and 
the divine ascension material. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> Late in the design process we shared our 
work, made some revisions based on each others' comments, and then 
dumped the whole load on James to pull together into a book.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> I spent a month stitching the pieces 
together and making some overarching changes that came up as various 
people reviewed the manuscript. It's a frequently chaotic, sometimes 
frustrating, but generally quite rewarding process. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: Of all the creativity you've brought to the new<i> Deities and Demigods,</i> what are you most proud of? </b></p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2004-07%20-%20Deities%20and%20Demigods_files/DeitiesandDemigods_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="215" width="173">Skip:</b>
 In terms of the work I did, I'd have to say the basic system for 
presenting gods, which takes some familiar concepts from the past and 
blends them into the current game. In terms of what's in the book 
overall, I'm happiest about the supporting material that explores making
 gods your own.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> I'd have to say Chapter 7, which contains
 various small pantheons and mystery cults, is my favorite part of my 
work on the book, and I wish it could have been bigger. There's a 
monotheistic religion that doesn't look much like any real-world 
monotheism, a dualistic religion that focuses on positive and negative 
energy, and a dwarven earth-mother cult in there, much of which is 
material drawn from my own campaigns but heavily reworked.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> It's harder for me to answer this, for a 
couple of reasons. One is that I worked on it so long ago, and have 
worked on so many projects since then, that it's hard to recall a 
specific thing I'm more proud of than the rest of the book. Another 
reason is that, with multiple designers all sharing ideas and commenting
 on each other's work, the lines between what any one person worked on 
are blurry. I think it's a terrific book, but it wouldn't be if you 
subtracted any one of us.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wizards: And finally, for the sake of 
conversation... if you were to liken yourself to one of the divine 
beings in this particular book, which one would you say you are most 
like... and why?</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>James:</b> My own theology is probably closest to 
Dennari, the dwarven earth-mother goddess. She's all about justice and 
freedom, liberation from oppression, and perseverance in hardship and 
suffering. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rich:</b> I don't know how much I'm like him, but I 
found myself strongly identifying with Thor as I wrote the Asgardian 
pantheon. Something about his fierce joy in life and battle appealed to 
me, I guess.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skip:</b> After taking an informal poll among my colleagues, I suggest Boccob (The Uncaring).</p>
