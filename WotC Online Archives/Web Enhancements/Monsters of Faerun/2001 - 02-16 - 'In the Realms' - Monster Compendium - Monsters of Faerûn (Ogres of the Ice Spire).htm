<p class="size2"><b>Ogres of the Ice Spire</b></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Ghours can be found among any group of chaotic evil 
giants, ogres, or minotaurs. These creatures view a ghour's presence as a
 sign of Baphomet's great pleasure.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>A group of ogres in the Ice Spire mountains, north 
of Citadel Adbar and west of Anauroch, worships Baphomet with great 
devotion. These ogres are larger and stronger than their common cousins 
and in recent years have been more active than ever before. Rangers and 
sages suspect that the cause of this increased activity is the presence 
of a ghour in their midst. . . .</i></p>
<p class="size2">-- from the entry for Demon, Ghour</p>
<p class="size2">Baphomet is an abyssal lord: a demon of near-godlike 
power, revered by such creatures as minotaurs, ogres, and renegade 
giants. This foul being's aims on Faerûn are unknown, but increased 
activity among his servants has led to the discovery of the ghour, a 
demonic creature not seen in Faerûn before a few years ago. Acora, a 
cleric of Tyr and careful observer of demonic activity in Faerûn, 
suspects that Baphomet is making a bid for true godhood, collecting the 
nucleus of what will become his worshipers through active expansionism 
in the Ice Spire mountains and Thar. </p>
<p class="size2">As creatures of pure chaos and evil, Baphomet and his 
minions are not prone to empire-building. Instead, Baphomet's most loyal
 servants, the ghours, lead small bands of perhaps half a dozen giants, 
ogres, or minotaurs in acts of raiding, plunder, and rampage. An 
individual ghour may lead several such bands, using its ability to <i>teleport without error</i>
 to effectively be in several places at once, providing leadership when 
needed and leaving the bands on their own to accomplish what they do 
best. </p>
<p class="size2">Khurgroth is not an exceptional ghour, nor even one of 
Baphomet's favorite minions. But he does his job effectively, and has 
inspired tremendous acts of carnage among several groups of ogres in the
 Ice Spire mountains. These ogres worship Baphomet without comprehending
 that he is not (yet) a true deity, and the shamans (adepts) among them 
work magic by sheer acts of faith. Their devotion, combined with the 
inspiring example of Khurgroth, leads them into a state of pure blood 
rage they call the Blood Dance. These ogres are nothing more than 
1st-level barbarians with the normal Rage ability of their class, but 
they view their rage as a divinely inspired state, a blessing of 
Baphomet to give them victory over their enemies.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Suggested Adventure Arc</b></p>
<p class="size2">These bands of ogre barbarians and their demonic leader
 pose a serious threat to the people of the Silver Marches, particularly
 in the northern reaches around Citadel Adbar. An entire mini-campaign 
could be structured around the player characters' attempt to protect 
caravans and other citadel travelers from the depredations of these 
ogres, leading finally to the discovery of the ghour responsible. Such 
an adventure arc might be structured like this:</p>
<p class="size2"> Before beginning the adventure, introduce fairly low 
(3rd- to 5th-) level PCs to Ice Spire ogres in small numbers: a single 
ogre at level 3, a pair at level 5. These should be apparently random 
wilderness encounters. Save the ogre shamans for later.</p>
<p class="size2"> Begin the adventure arc in earnest around level 7. 
While the PCs travel to or from Citadel Adbar on some other important 
business, they are attacked by a powerful force of Ice Spire ogres (use 
enough typical ogres, advanced ogres, and shamans for an Encounter Level
 at least 2 higher than the average PC level). The ogres are not 
bandits; Khurgroth sent them out raiding simply to force them to prove 
their strength. If this group includes a shaman, it will be the first 
time the PCs encounter the holy symbol of Baphomet.</p>
<p class="size2"> Once the PCs arrive at their destination, they hear 
dwarven warriors from Citadel Adbar exchanging stories about assaults by
 large ogres who fight with incredible ferocity. One of the dwarves 
(Kurel, a female cleric of Moradin) asks whether anyone has spotted the 
symbol of Baphomet among the ogres. None of the dwarves have, but Kurel 
will gladly hear the PCs' story should they wish to tell it. If they do,
 Kurel identifies the symbol as that of the abyssal lord, and expresses 
concern that these frequent ogre raids have something to do with the 
worship of Baphomet. She offers a handsome reward (a valuable magic 
item) for information about the ogres' organization. If the PC party 
includes a lawful good dwarf, she gives that character an enchanted 
weapon (preferable a holy dwarven waraxe, but appropriate to the 
abilities and level of the character) to carry into battle against the 
ogres.</p>
<p class="size2"> When the PCs go looking for ogres, let it take a while
 to find them. The mountains of the North are dangerous, and the party 
can experience a number of unrelated encounters before coming across 
another ogre raiding party. (A pair of perytons, a fog giant, or a squad
 of dragonkin might be appropriate "random" encounters from <i>Monsters of Faerûn.</i>)
 When they finally do encounter more ogres, the foes should be a smaller
 group, about the same EL as the PCs' average level. This group -- not 
under orders to attack travelers and already having heard of the PCs' 
defeat of the larger party -- attempts to flee and find reinforcements. 
(Ideally, this phase of the adventure arc should bring the characters up
 to 8th or even 9th level.)</p>
<p class="size2"> Faced with increasing raids and surprisingly organized
 behavior, the PCs must track the ogres to the Ice Spires -- a region 
infested with all varieties of giantkind. If the characters remain 
focused on their task, they may actually manage to negotiate with hill 
giants for information about the ogres, learning that the ogres' 
aggressiveness is not directed solely at the folk of the Silver Marches:
 They have even attacked giants. If the characters decide to fight 
everything they see, they face some tough battles with hill and possibly
 stone giants, none of whom pay allegiance to Baphomet (but all of whom 
know of his existence). Giants aside, the characters encounter Ice Spire
 ogres aplenty -- holed up in small cavern lairs, in bands of half a 
dozen or so. These cavern lairs all contain images of Baphomet crudely 
painted on the walls, as well as images of another figure: a huge, 
horned ogre. In some paintings, the horned ogre (Khurgroth) is shown 
standing over a deep crevasse, presiding over sacrifices to Baphomet 
(shown as a shadowy figure looming behind his demon servant), while 
noxious fumes (painted in hideous greens and yellows) rise from its 
depths.</p>
<p class="size2"> As the climax to the adventure arc, the PCs travel to 
the Dour Fissure (as the ogres call it) to confront Khurgroth and his 
minions on their home turf. The demon and ogres use their knowledge of 
the terrain to their best advantage, presenting a tremendous final 
challenge to the characters.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Encounter Guidelines</b></p>
<p class="size2">Ice Spire ogres in small numbers make suitable 
opponents for fairly low-level characters. In larger numbers, however, 
they can take on high-level characters with ease. Consult the following 
list for suggested encounters appropriate to PC parties of various 
levels. Statistics blocks for typical Ice Spire ogres (1st-level 
barbarians), advanced Ice Spire ogres (5th-level barbarians), and ogre 
shamans (4th-level adepts) follow.</p>
<p class="size2">EL 3: one Ice Spire ogre</p>
<p class="size2">EL 5: two Ice Spire ogres, <i>or</i> one shaman</p>
<p class="size2">EL 7: four Ice Spire ogres, <i>or</i> one advanced Ice Spire ogre, <i>or</i> two Ice Spire ogres plus one shaman</p>
<p class="size2">EL 8: four Ice Spire ogres plus one shaman, <i>or</i> one advanced Ice Spire ogre plus one shaman</p>
<p class="size2">EL 9: two advanced Ice Spire ogres, <i>or</i> four Ice Spire ogres plus one advanced Ice Spire ogre, <i>or</i> two Ice Spire ogres plus one advanced Ice Spire ogre plus one shaman</p>
<p class="size2">EL 10: six Ice Spire ogres plus one advanced Ice Spire ogre plus one shaman</p>
<p class="size2">EL 13: Khurgroth plus six Ice Spire ogres plus one advanced Ice Spire ogre plus one shaman.</p>
