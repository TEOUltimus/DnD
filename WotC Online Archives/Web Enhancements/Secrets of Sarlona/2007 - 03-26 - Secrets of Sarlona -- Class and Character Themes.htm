<p>Introduced in <i>Player's Handbook II</i>, character themes are a way
 to add specificity and detail to your character's chosen class. 
Especially in Sarlona, such background elements can help inform your 
character creation choices and add depth to your roleplaying. The 
Sarlonan milieu can be very different indeed from Khorvaire. The 
information below provides Sarlonan-flavored themes for each of the core
 character classes, plus -- naturally -- the four basic psionic classes.
 Suggested backgrounds are also included, and further information can be
 found in the Sarlonan Backgrounds section.</p>
<p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#f2f2f2" width="300"><tbody><tr><td>
<p><b>Sarlona and Character Themes</b></p>
<p>The character themes outlined below are generally intended for 
campaigns within Sarlona itself but can be adapted to characters in 
Khorvaire with Sarlonan origins. For Riedran character themes, bear in 
mind the particular flavor of that nation when assembling your party. 
Riedra may not lend itself well to the "random group of adventurers come
 together in a tavern" model, ut it's very good for "adventurers bound 
together by common allegiance and cause."</p>
<p>Consider the possibility of having an entire party tied to Riedran 
organizations such as The Thousand Eyes, Harmonious Shield, or 
Edgewalkers. Alternatively, the party could be an internal resistance 
group such as the Horned Shadow or the Unchained. (These organizations 
are described in the Riedra section of Chapter 1 of <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i>.)
 Such campaigns would have a different flavor. Rather than simply 
wandering Riedra seeking fortune and glory; characters are either 
struggling to survive as resistance or taking direct action against the 
challenges facing the nation.</p>

</p>
<h4>Barbarian</h4>
<p>You are a creature of the wilds, able to tap into a primal fury when 
confronting your enemies. The comforts and complications of civilized 
life are totally foreign to you. Instead, you live a life of spare and 
even brutal simplicity. Only in battle or the hunt can certainty be had 
-- conquer and survive or fail and die. The wild places of Sarlona are 
your home.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Gladiator, Mariner, Tribal Origin</p>
<p><b>Theme: Tundra Sentry. </b>You are a battle-bred warrior with one 
purpose in life -- vanquishing the enemies of your tribe. In the untamed
 tundra, you are a feared and respected protector of your people -- 
likely human or shifter, but the Tashana knows all races of warrior. In 
the northern lands, you might be tasked with combating the terrible 
menace of the brutal Kalaak. In the south, you might be among the fierce
 warriors of the borderlands. Or you may be one of the few lone warriors
 of the Tundra, with allegiance to no tribe. <i>Feel now the icy wrath of the Tundra!</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Wildfighter. </b>You are a creature of ultimate freedom in 
the vanishing free lands of Sarlona. In Syrkarn or Adar, you represent 
the true spirit of the land standing against Riedran aggression, be it 
overt or otherwise. You know that subtle machinations of mind or magic 
cannot stand against the fury of your blade, and you will not be cowed 
by arrogant interlopers. <b>Where is your mind magic now, bloodied one? </b></p>
<h4>Bard</h4>
<p>You are the ultimate wanderer, but you are not lost. You bring songs 
and tales to the people of Sarlona, often trading information and lore 
for a hot meal and a bed. Sarlona is nothing if not a land of intrigue, 
and your specialty is finding the narrow way between dangers to escape 
with epic stories for your next destination.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Drifter, Mariner, Noble Scion</p>
<p><b>Theme: Dream Merchant:</b> You're a smuggler of forbidden goods 
and information within the orderly nation of Riedra. You understand more
 than most about the strange and deadly workings of the lands of the 
Inspired, and you often find yourself dodging the baleful glare of the 
Thousand Eyes. Information is a commodity, and you are an expert fence 
-- buying, selling, trading, and keeping copious mental notes of all you
 encounter. Your travels take you from the harrowing peaks of besieged 
Adar to the tribal lands of Tashana and back again through the 
treacherous cities of Riedra -- treacherous, at least, to those in your 
line of work. <i>I might have something here that would interest you, if you have something that interests me ....</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Tashanan Piper. </b>Among the people of the Tashana Tundra,
 the piper serves the role of storyteller and lorekeeper, traveling 
among the tribes to keep alive the stories and songs of the Tashana. As a
 Piper, you are respected and welcomed in most all communities, be they 
human, shifter, or half-giant, although you certainly take your chances 
braving the wild in-betweens of the Tundra. Pipers traditionally employ 
the intricate bone-flutes of the Tashana, although other instruments -- 
particularly drums -- are common. Syrkarn and Adar have their own 
equivalent of the Piper tradition, bound to no political entity but 
rather to the soil of Sarlona itself. <i>I bring you a tale of ice, I bring you a song of fire ....</i></p>
<h4>Cleric</h4>
<p>The giving of thanks, prayer and meditation, and devout adherence to 
divine will are the cornerstones of your faith and your life. The power 
of your deity courses through your very soul, granting you powers and 
abilities beyond the ken of the uninitiated -- the power to heal, the 
power to harm, the power to harness divine energies in service to a 
higher being.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Ascetic, Noble Scion</p>
<p><b>Theme: Priest of the Riedran Spirit. </b>As a priest of the 
nation, you have no knowledge of or loyalty to the Dreaming Dark but 
rather revere the ideals embodied by your nation. The spirit of Riedra 
as a people is your deity, and you travel the length and breadth of 
Sarlona -- even sailing to Khorvaire -- to share your enlightened 
culture with the savages. You could be attached to the Edgewalkers or 
Harmonious Shield, and you know firsthand the peace and prosperity that 
the Inspired offer to the world. <i>There need not be war! There need not be strife! Embrace the peace and serenity that is our gift to you.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Flamekeeper. </b>You are a preserver and defender of the 
old faiths of Sarlona, blessed and tasked with keeping alive the 
flickering flames of belief. Whether a Syrk battle priest, an Adaran 
ascetic, a stalwart cleric of the dwarven Dorann lineage, or an Akiak 
war chaplain, you maintain the Sarlonan connection to various aspects of
 the Sovereign Host or the Path of Light. As an intermediary of divine 
powers, you know that the very structures of nature and society depend 
on a connection with divine will -- and that the people of Sarlona 
desperately need your help and guidance. <i>And may we be released to the Light, and may we know the Light, and may no shadows fall between ourselves and the Light.</i></p>
<h4>Druid</h4>
<p>You feel within yourself ancient rhythms -- the cycle of the seasons,
 the pull of the tides, the dance of the stars, and the terrestrial 
stirrings of all living things. You bring the comfort of spring's warmth
 to those who respect nature and the fury of winter storms to those who 
would despoil it. You are part of an ancient and mystical order, raised 
to learn and to keep sacred the songs, prayers, and incantations that 
celebrate the natural order of life.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Ascetic, Farm Hand, Tribal Origin</p>
<p><b>Theme: Tashana Avenger. </b>Of all the lands of Eberron, the 
Tashana Tundra is perhaps the most pure and unspoiled. The power of this
 land courses through you, exhilarating and humbling, and you stand 
proud to protect its animals and native people. Of all the enemies of 
the Tundra, it is the vicious Kalaak who earn your mighty wrath. With 
their wanton destruction of life, their very presence scorches the 
Tashana. For countless generations, the tribal peoples of the Tundra 
have lived in harmony with the land. You draw on this power with every 
rising sun to battle back against the forces of unnatural destruction. <i>In wind and ice do I bind you, demonspawn. Return to the earth where you might serve a purpose.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Sky Speaker. </b>You are part of a Sarlonan druidic 
tradition that looks to the sky for inspiration, instruction, and 
benediction. In the endless swirling of the stars, you see signs of 
prophecy; in the flight of birds, you find resonance and harmony. While 
you are at peace with the earth and waters, it is the voice of the sky 
that speaks to you most clearly. Passing and fragile are the nations of 
man and dwarf, giant and ogre, demon and dragon. But the sun remains, 
and the moons and the stars, and the clouds and the winds. <i>Look to the heavens, friend and companion, for the sky is forever abiding.</i></p>
<h4>Fighter</h4>
<p>You are a practitioner of the noble art of armed combat. You live for
 the thrill of the fight and the elation of vanquishing a worthy foe -- 
or unworthy, for that matter. Whether you are lending your skill at arms
 to a cause, fighting for adventure and glory, or just doing it for the 
gold, you live to be the best at what you do. Combat styles come in a 
thousand different flavors, but in the end it all comes down to one 
thing. Who's left standing?</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Gladiator, Guttersnipe, Noble Scion, Soldier</p>
<p><b>Theme: Riedran Enforcer. </b>You are a patriot and a believer, 
skilled and disciplined in the martial traditions. You take great pride 
in battling enemies of the state -- the primitive Akiak insurgents, the 
feral shifter tribes of the Tundra, and especially the treacherous 
kalashtar and humans of Adar. As an adventurer, you may be engaged in an
 ongoing campaign on a specific front, or you may be part of a special 
forces unit deployed wherever the need arises. <i>For glory! For honor! For Riedra! </i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Elite Mercenary. </b>You are bound to no nation, tribe, or 
clan. Neither are you a hired sword, a simple brute willing to shed any 
blood for coin. No, you are a true artist of combat and battle, 
sometimes following the winds of fate, sometimes actively seeking out 
worthy challenges for yourself. It's not about gold, it's not about 
glory, and it's certainly not about allegiance to nation or cause. It's 
about the dance of combat, the flash of metal, the moment of the battle 
itself. <i>Friends, if I may ask a boon. Leave the big one for me. He's mine.</i></p>
<h4>Monk</h4>
<p>In the cloistered stillness of the monastery or the hidden places of 
the wild, you received your training. Your strength flows from 
discipline, knowledge, and technique. You have worked your entire life 
to perfect mind and body, and it is a journey you will continue to walk 
the rest of your days. For you, action and intent flow from deeper 
currents, and you strive for precision and clarity in all you do. You 
are a spiritual warrior, and you have chosen your side.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Ascetic, Gladiator</p>
<p><b>Theme: Adaran Timespanner. </b>You hail from the ageless 
monasteries of Adar, home to great monastic traditions unrivaled on a 
dozen planes. You are a defender of the Land of Refuge, which has 
offered shelter to the desperate and hunted for ages uncounted. For you,
 time is but an illusion. Adar has always been and forever shall be. The
 only true reality is the moment, and the moment is eternal. Adar is 
ceaselessly besieged -- Adar is forever at rest. You are the protector, 
and this is your home. <i>You fail to understand. Here marks the border of the Land of Refuge, and you shall not pass.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Walker. </b>You belong to a loosely-affiliated order of 
monks that maintain no permanent monasteries yet can be found in every 
corner of Sarlona. Your sect practices a style of walking meditation in 
which constant and deliberate movement is both practice and ideal -- 
movement of the body through space, of the soul through time ... of the 
weapon ... of the fist. Independent and self-reliant to the extreme, 
yours is a life of constant change as you travel incessantly from place 
to place, overcoming all obstacles and breaching all boundaries. <i>A journey of ten thousand miles begins with ten thousand steps.</i></p>
<h4>Paladin</h4>
<p>You are an embodiment of righteousness and good, given power over 
evil in all its incarnations. Your deity protects you from harm, wards 
you from fear, and grants you the ability to heal others and yourself. 
Your faith and devotion underlie your strength in arms, and your bravery
 inspires all who join you in battle. You are bound by a code of honor 
to protect the innocent, smite the wicked, and uphold justice.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Ascetic, Noble Scion, Soldier</p>
<p><b>Theme: Dorann Clanguard. </b>You are part of an ancient order of 
holy warriors, called to duty once again. Recent years have seen the 
Dorann Holds on the brink of civil war, and the people of your nation 
face a terrible peril. You and the brothers and sisters of your order 
have arisen to seek out the root of this evil, wherever the quest may 
take you. As the clans prepare for war, you journey the wider world of 
Sarlona in an attempt to uncover the mysterious corruption that has 
gripped your nation. <i>We are a people of stone and ice, and we shall not be sundered!</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Lightbringer:</b> You hail from the lands of Adar where you
 revere the universal force of positive energy known as il-Yannah. As a 
warrior of the Path of Light, your very existence serves but one purpose
 -- to penetrate the foul blackness of the Dreaming Dark. This is your 
battle, your people's battle, and you bring light and hope to the 
besieged nation of Adar. As the Dreaming Dark spreads its nefarious 
influence, you journey across Sarlona and the other continents to dispel
 the growing darkness with sword, with shield, with light. <i>Darkness is not the opposite of Light. It is the absence of Light.</i></p>
<h4>Ranger</h4>
<p>You have found your true home in the wild places of the world. As a 
consummate explorer and guide, your skills are always in demand. 
Self-reliance and adaptability are your hallmarks, and you always have 
the advantage when meeting a foe on natural terrain. Your affinity with 
the land allows you to track and hunt with mystical prowess, and your 
versatility with weaponry makes you deadly with sword or bow.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Drifter, Farm Hand, Mariner, Soldier, Tribal Origin</p>
<p><b>Theme: Syrkarn Warden. </b>You are a protector of the wild lands 
of Syrkarn, a lone guardian standing against those who would crush 
freedom in your lands. You are among the few who truly recognize the 
threat that the nation of Riedra poses, and you count among your enemies
 the furtive Riedran agents that plague all of Syrkarn. No one knows the
 borderlands between Riedra and Syrkarn as well as you do, and you're 
willing to take the fight to your enemies wherever they may be. <i>There, now, didn't I tell you? Riedran scouts look so much better with arrows sticking out of them ....</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Taskaan Shifter. </b>Bred to serve an Inspired lord, you 
earn ascension in your next life by fighting in this one. You are a 
hunter, pure and simple, and you pursue the enemies of your nation 
relentlessly. You're equally at home in the wilderness or the cities and
 towns of Sarlona. Whether tracking the Heirs of Ohr Kaluun, battling 
the Akiak and agents of Adar, or dispatching monsters that escape from 
the wild zones, you are ruthlessly efficient. It's a pity that a job 
such as yours has to exist, but so long as the peace of Riedra is 
threatened, you are duty-bound to respond in kind. <i>And where now are the clever remarks about arrows, Syrk dog?</i></p>
<h4>Rogue</h4>
<p>You're a slippery one, all right. There are those who prefer a 
straight fight to sneaking around, and there are those like you. Why 
bother with all the mess and blood when a little stealth or a few 
well-placed bluffs do the trick just as well? You're an opportunist and a
 thief, but you're also a skillful practitioner of ancient arts. You 
might specialize in one of these arts -- lockpicking, forgery, or 
infiltration -- but you're versatile and adaptable enough to squeeze 
your way through most any situation. In a party of adventurers, you're 
indispensable. Not many can do the things you can do, and fewer still 
can do them as well.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Drifter, Guttersnipe, Mariner</p>
<p><b>Theme: Opportunist. </b>You travel all of Sarlona, from the 
rarified airs of wealthy city enclaves to the roads and wharfs of the 
trade routes, in an effort to find and exploit the best opportunities 
for advancing your agenda. Usually, that agenda is simple -- gold and 
valuables. But you also broker influence and knowledge -- you might spy 
for the Thousand Eyes one day and smuggle out dissidents the next. You 
know how to fence valuable goods, always skimming a little something off
 the top. There are marvelous new opportunities in Sarlona these days, 
as official Riedran trade with Khorvaire expands. You also know about 
the unofficial trade that takes place in Syrkarn and Tashana. Wherever 
money is changing hands, you're right at home. <i>Sure, I can get that for you. I know some Lhazaar, er, specialists in Winterstead ....</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Double Agent. </b>You are a former member of the Thousand 
Eyes, the Riedran 'secret police', and you've turned against your 
controllers after discovering an especially disturbing truth. Depending 
on your tolerance for howling paranoia, you might even still be in the 
employ of the Eyes, working under deep cover, fighting the oppressors 
from within. Or it may be that you've escaped the clutches of this 
formidable organization and now use your insider knowledge to assist 
enemies of the state in Adar, Syrkarn, or the Tundra. Perhaps you're 
simply on the run, a rogue agent trying desperately to escape your past,
 feeling the Eyes upon you at every turn. <i>Yes, I've got identification papers. Several sets, actually. Several dozen, now that I think about it ....</i></p>
<h4>Sorcerer</h4>
<p>Mystic rhythms pulse through your mind, and arcane energies flow 
through your body. You are a sorcerer, and magic is in your very blood. 
You suffered no apprenticeship, and require no yellowing scrolls or 
crumbling spellbooks. You can manifest magic by the force of your will 
alone, with a creativity and spontaneity that scholarly wizards will 
never know. Some say you are descended from dragons, that such 
awe-inspiring power must be a gift of the ancient wyrms. You do not 
argue.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Ascetic, Drifter, Noble Scion</p>
<p><b>Theme: Lone Mystic. </b>No one knows the true extent of the power 
you can wield, least of all yourself. You know that you are marked, that
 you are fundamentally different, but you do not know yet whether this 
is a blessing or a curse. For your own good, and possibly the good of 
others, you walk your path alone, disclosing your intents for the future
 -- and your secrets of the past -- to no one. You are searching for 
something you cannot name, something that will bring you into harmony 
with the arcane energies that burn in your heart and mind. <i>Good evening, keeper. I require a bed, a fire, a meal -- and no questions.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Planeseeker. </b>Your lineage predates even the great 
Sarlonan empires of old, and you seek knowledge of the true nature of 
the planar breaches so common to Sarlona. There is something within you 
that resonates with the ancient energies of these places and phenomena. 
You actively seek out experience and knowledge of planar magic and 
journey to the various manifest zones of Sarlona -- the wild preserves 
of Riedra, the breaches of Adar and Syrkarn, and the drifting reality 
storms of the Tashana Tundra. <i>I sense a rending in this place, still unstitched. There are old magics here.</i></p>
<h4>Wizard</h4>
<p>Through diligent research and scholarship, you intend to master the 
labyrinthine pathways of magic. Your travels take you from cloistered 
libraries to treacherous ruins, all in service of acquiring the tomes 
and scrolls of powerful and sometimes forbidden arcana. Your sanctum is 
crowded with stacks of books, beakers and vials, and other strange 
artifacts of the eldritch arts. Your calling is at once a craft, an art,
 and a science -- and you know full well that only the most meticulous 
and courageous can ascend to the ultimate heights of magical power.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Ascetic, Noble Scion</p>
<p><b>Theme: Keeper of the Word. </b>In the mist-shrouded mountains of 
Adar, you preserve the mystical traditions of your ancestors who were 
long ago purged from the lands of Riedra by the Inspired. The Keepers of
 the Word are spread throughout the mountains in strongholds and 
fortresses, and other more secret places. Here you share the protections
 of the land of refuge with the kalashtar and other besieged peoples of 
Adar. You are tasked with preserving magical knowledge that is literally
 thousands of years old. Travel in the lands outside Adaran border is 
particularly hazardous for you, as the Inspired long to destroy the 
knowledge of your order. <i>We are besieged, but we are not fallen. The Word is kept, and still spoken, here in the land of refuge.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Fugitive. </b>You belong to an alliance of arcane scholars 
who seek to reclaim the traditions of the past -- before the Sundering, 
before the purges, before Riedra. Hunted by agents of the Inspired, you 
tread carefully through the lands of Sarlona to practice your craft 
along with other scholars of the Broken Throne. Your work and research 
must be done in secret, for there are items still within the borders of 
Riedra that you wish to reclaim -- relics and remnants from a time when 
magic was the most powerful force in the land. As you collect the lost 
knowledge of the twelve nations, you're ever mindful of the treachery of
 the Inspired. <i>They think they know the powers of the mind, but they do not know my powers, nor my mind. This shall be their doom.</i></p>
<h4>Artificer</h4>
<p>You are a crafter of fundamental magics, weaving raw energy into 
items and constructs. The work you do is ultimately beyond the 
understanding of even the most learned of spellcasters, as you sculpt 
primal forces and bring them to bear in the material world. Your 
infusions and alterations can render the most mundane physical item into
 a powerful magical tool. Yours is magic-working in its most abstract 
form. You are a true artist.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Ascetic, Noble Scion</p>
<p><b>Theme: Arcane Fence. </b>You're one of but a handful of 
individuals skilled, brave, or crazy enough to practice the arts of the 
artificer within the cities and towns of Riedra. Working with an 
underground network of sources and allies -- most likely within the 
Dream Merchants -- you deal in wands and scrolls, potions and 
constructs. You supply dissidents with the tools and weapons they need 
to fight the Inspired or to flee to the free lands beyond Riedran 
borders. Among your clients, too, are the wealthy and foolish -- those 
who would have their illegal toys regardless the risk. The typical 
Riedran commoner fears and loathes your corrupt magic and would report 
you in a heartbeat. You're a black market dealer in an extremely hostile
 venue. <i>Here's a little something I put together for later, save it 
until you reach the border. As always, you were never here, and we've 
never met.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Tashanan Crafter. </b>You are an innovator in the realms of
 magic, exploring a new frontier of possibility. You hail from the vast 
plains of the Tashana Tundra, where the bond between the people and 
their land is unbreakable. Here you craft powerful totemic items and 
substances that draw on the pure and natural strength of this remarkable
 place. In place of potions, you might prepare a paste of rock lichens 
and fungi. In place of scrolls, you might scribe upon hide or driftwood.
 You craft odd and beautiful items of great power -- medicine rattles 
and tribal masks, fetishes and constructs of bone or even ice. Your work
 melds magic, technology, and spirit into one primal force. <i>Whalebone, soapstone, dried lichens … aha, here it is! Kalaak fingerbone! Powerful magic -- use wisely…</i></p>
<h4>Psion</h4>
<p>Through tenacious discipline and a structured practice of meditation,
 you are committed to mastering the powers of the mind. Where others 
find strength in the sword or the twisting pathways of magic, you wield 
the innate energy of the psyche itself. Within you, even greater powers 
lie dormant, and you endeavor to free these latent abilities as you 
explore the endless recesses of your own mind.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Artisan, Ascetic, Noble Scion</p>
<p><b>Theme: Chosen Telepath. </b>Specially selected and carefully 
trained in the psionic arts, you have been appointed as a goodwill 
ambassador to the other nations of Eberron. Yours is a great honor, and 
you endeavor to serve your nation dutifully, using your telepathic 
powers to gather information and facilitate beneficial relations. As a 
member of the Chosen, you know (or at least you have been told) that 
it's taken many lifetimes to arrive at this blessed incarnation. Soon 
you will ascend to the status of the Inspired and finally know the true 
nature of union with the awesome powers that drive the nation of Riedra.
 <i>Greeting from Riedra, good gentles. I trust we will enjoy a true meeting of the minds.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Kalashtar Seer. </b>You have chosen the psionic discipline 
of clairsentience and dedicated your life to employing your powers in 
the struggle against the Dreaming Dark. You navigate the eddies and 
whirls of space/time itself, using your precognitive powers to guide 
your comrades and your farsight abilities to monitor remote events and 
enemies. You've chosen to bring the fight to the aggressors, wandering 
far from the mountainous refuge of Adar to battle the agents of Dal Quor
 wherever they may be. <i>There are those who say you can't be everywhere at once, but I beg to differ…</i></p>
<h4>Psychic Warrior </h4>
<p>You seek perfection in both mind and body, forging physical and 
psychic energies together into a steely essence greater than the sum of 
its parts. Your considerable martial power flows from the union of these
 seemingly disparate elements -- your strength is bound in discipline, 
honed in intent. Yours is a deadly combination of strength, skill and 
psionic might.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Drifter, Gladiator, Soldier</p>
<p><b>Theme: Shield Renegade. </b>You were raised for a sole purpose -- 
to serve as a soldier in Riedra's powerful army of the Harmonious 
Shield. You were taught that honorable death in battle was the surest of
 all paths to spiritual advancement in the next life. Years of psychic 
indoctrination very nearly burned all mercy and empathy from your soul …
 but then something gave way. A certain clarity descended, and you found
 you could no longer in good conscience live the life that was dictated 
as your inescapable destiny. Breaking ranks with the Shield, you have 
become a fugitive from your own kind, hunted by your former comrades. <i>I don't consider it shedding blood, really. More like making amends.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Legacy Walker. </b>You are a warrior among the nomadic 
troupes of the Sarlonan half-giant "families." While most walkers are 
half-giant, descended from the great titans of Xen'drik, many families 
adopt individuals of other races as well. Legacy walkers are the most 
elite warriors within a wandering family, often serving as scouts and 
vanguards. Within you, mental might and physical prowess combine with 
fearsome intensity. Whether you hail from the Icebinders of the Tashana,
 the Sandstriders of Syrkarn, or the gypsy Trampers of Adar, you travel 
the lands of Sarlona brandishing your unique style of psychically 
augmented steel. <i>If you stand against any of the family, you stand against all of the family.</i></p>
<h4>Soulknife</h4>
<p>You are unique amongst all martial warriors, for the blade you wield 
is forged not from metal or crystal but from pure psychic energy. Your 
mind blade is lethal in more ways than one, functioning both as a 
physical sword and a powerful psionic weapon. Through relentless 
practice and discipline, you are set above the common swordsman, for who
 else can materialize a blade of pure thought, desire, and will?</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Ascetic, Drifter, Gladiator</p>
<p><b>Theme: Rogue Assassin. </b>As a member of the Chosen born to a 
shadow lineage of assassins, you were raised and trained to be nothing 
less than the ultimate killing machine. Deep in the labyrinthine halls 
of Riedra's fortresses, you learned to manifest your aggression into a 
razor of lethal energy in service to the Dreaming Dark. But you have 
left that life behind, for reasons that are entirely your own, and 
embarked on your own path to destiny. Few are those who dare to break 
from the Sleeping Sword, fewer still those who survive to tell the tale.
 To your former masters, you're a danger -- a deadly weapon gone rogue. <i>Would that I had not seen what I have seen. Would that I had not done what I have done.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Quori Pathwalker. </b>The soulknife has long been a common 
martial tradition of both the kalashtar and Inspired, with the mind 
blade reflecting the bond to Dal Quor and the endless conflict of that 
dream realm. Perhaps you walk the path of the Jilashtora, the "Flowing 
Blades," or the Ojilashta, the "Bladeshapers." You own no scabbard, but 
you are never unarmed. (<a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20050110a&amp;origin=dnd_we_20070326a">Read more on Quori martial traditions</a>.) <i>For my sisters and I, intent and action are as one.</i></p>
<h4>Wilder</h4>
<p>For you, the true power of the mind flows not from rigorous mental 
discipline but from violent surges of feeling and emotion. The psion's 
obsession with illusory control dampens her power -- you understand the 
unbridled strength of raw passion. Yours is a treacherous path, but 
personal development of your psychic potential is paramount. It is your 
courage and the very force of your personality that allows you to 
channel such awesome power.</p>
<p><b>Suggested Backgrounds</b> (choose one): Ascetic, Drifter, Mariner</p>
<p><b>Theme: Colonial Scout. </b>Your people hail from the maenad lands 
of the remote Tashyvar Islands. As a Colonial Scout, you have been 
tasked with exploring Sarlona to find new areas for future settlement. 
As you've made your way in the wider world, you've found the life of an 
adventurer suits your personal quest to continue development of your 
psionic potential. But you are always mindful of your obligation to your
 people, as you assess new lands and situations for the maenad colonial 
initiative. You are bound to your people in a way your companions can 
never understand, and you yourself can never fully deny. <i>Our home disappeared beneath the waves ages ago. And so we seek a new one.</i></p>
<p><b>Theme: Sarlonan Sovereign. </b>Sarlona is a land awash in chaotic 
psychic energies and has been so for time immemorial. Kingdoms and ages 
wax and wane, but the power of the land remains throughout. You are a 
sovereign of the land itself, bound to no one. You owe no debts of 
allegiance and have been entirely self-reliant in the development of 
your innate power. For you, true meaning can only be found in the 
manifestation of these powers. You adventure to discover new techniques 
and items to further this personal quest, living for the moments of 
surging power when you channel the energies of Sarlona itself. <i>This land has seen many empires rise and fall. Riedra, too, will pass.</i></p>
