<p>Introduced in <i>Player's Handbook II</i>, backgrounds are a way to 
customize your character's history to give depth to your mechanical 
choices and your roleplaying. In playing a Sarlonan character, you must 
consider the culture your character comes from when choosing a 
background. This section provides some helpful information to flesh out a
 background into something truly Sarlonan.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#f2f2f2" width="300"><tbody><tr><td>
<p><b>Riedrans and Adventuring</b></p>
<p>As a player of a Riedran character, especially a human, you have some
 special considerations. Common people in Riedra don't just break out of
 their appointed roles and go adventuring. They stick to what they're 
told. Most are content with their lot, and few welcome, much less seek, 
any sort of change.</p>
<p>Options are available to you, however. Even if your character has an 
artisan or farmhand background, he or she might have performed some 
heroic deed or special service that was a sure sign of deserved movement
 on the Path of Inspiration -- say, military conscription or placement 
as a priest's assistant. Perhaps your character is one of the few 
Riedrans with a relationship to an underground group, raised with the 
knowledge that all is not necessarily well in the homeland, or maybe 
your character recently awakened to the reality of Riedra and is now on 
the run (see Drifter). Another possibility is that the character is some
 sort of criminal, rightly or wrongly accused, looking for a route to 
freedom. In this latter case, what a person did doesn't need to be evil.
 Many reasonable actions or unchangeable conditions are "crimes" in 
Riedra, or they are at least situations that get people "disappeared," 
including simply being born with psionic or magic talents.</p>

<p><b>Artisan</b></p>
<p>In Sarlona, artisans are just as numerous, if not more so, than in 
Khorvaire. They take on a different light depending on the Sarlonan 
society a character comes from.</p>
<p>Riedran artisans are specialists groomed from a young age to perfect 
some craft deemed important by their Inspired overlords. Few true 
artists are nonhuman. Riedrans tend to see work as spiritually important
 and obedience to the vision of the Inspired doubly so. Great 
craftsmanship doesn't raise one above one's commoner station in Riedra, 
but fine work is a sure sign of positive evolution on the Path of 
Inspiration.</p>
<p>Adaran craftpersons practice art as a form of meditation and leisure,
 and many have another day job. Their work is often folksy and 
practical. Elders teach children to be versatile and self-reliant, so 
most Adarans have some skill at crafting. In all of Sarlona, Adaran work
 is the most likely to be magecrafted or psionically enhanced. Xephs of 
Adar are especially noted for their exotic crystalworking traditions, 
and kalashtar are renowned for intuitively and intellectually 
sophisticated art.</p>
<p>Syrks of all races practice art forms lost to most of Sarlona, since 
their land is one of the few places on the continent where numerous 
relics of old Sarlonan kingdoms still stand. In Syrkarn, art is diverse 
and might be different in villages only a day's ride apart.</p>
<p>Folk of the steppes take their work seriously. As true tradespersons,
 they resemble mundane artisans of Khorvaire more than any others on 
Sarlona. They are second only to Adarans in their mixture of craft and 
the supernatural.</p>
<p>In the Tashana Tundra, dwarves toil in ways different from those of 
the Mror Holds, but none are more divergent from the dwarven norm than 
the Akiak dwarves. Dwarves of the Akiak clans have mastered alchemy, 
crystalwork, and metalwork. They build sophisticated magic, alchemical, 
and mechanical devices. Also in the Tundra, the shifter and human tribes
 produce beautiful native work that is surprisingly sophisticated for 
such "primitive" people. In fact, Tashanan shifter art is in great 
demand in certain circles of Khorvaire, especially Zilargo.</p>
<p><b>Ascetic</b></p>
<p>Ascetics are even more common in Sarlona than Khorvaire, and they 
tend to be more concentrated as well. Most come from Adar, but the other
 lands of Sarlona have their hermits and mystics.</p>
<p>Riedran ascetics tend to be those being groomed for priesthood on the
 Path of Inspiration. Youngsters placed in such positions are often 
observant and inquisitive, and their natural tendencies are channeled 
away from questioning what's around them toward questioning what's 
within and looking for ways to help their fellow citizens. Unlike 
counterparts in other societies, Riedran ascetics are closely monitored 
as they are schooled in proper recordkeeping, archiving, and scribing. 
Most times, indoctrination takes hold and the youth becomes a loyal 
priest, perhaps developing divine magic as a key to an abnormally 
venturesome life in the military or other unusual service. A tiny 
minority never becomes blind enough to be fooled by the veneer of 
righteousness in Riedran life, and such persons must flee Riedra or die.</p>
<p>Within the temple-fortresses of Adar, ascetics can be martial 
artists, arcanists, priests, psions, or any other sort of mystic. 
Sometimes, a single person is more than one.</p>
<p>The life of an ascetic in Adar varies. Most are expected to maintain a
 certain level of physical ability to keep the body strong for 
meditation and general mental sharpness. Many ascetics start out very 
young in physically active monastic traditions. While study is 
important, early conditioning focuses on balancing body and mind. As 
such, Adaran ascetics are also more focused on meditation than rote 
learning. Knowledge is dispensed in a practical and frank conversational
 manner that encourages comprehension and reflection over memorization. 
Adar's ascetics tend to be diversely skilled and highly moral.</p>
<p>Other types of ascetics exist, too, especially in Syrkarn and the 
Tundra, but these are unusual persons under the tutelage of some obscure
 sect or teacher. Often, such relationships are personal, centered on or
 surrounded by no group. The strange Qiku shaman who lives in 
self-imposed exile might take students, as might the Syrk mystic versed 
in ancient Sarlonan magic. In fact, this type of ascetic can be found in
 Adar as well, perhaps living in a high cave that can only be reached by
 a seemingly impossible climb. It's even feasible to find such teachers 
and students on the fringes of Riedran society, though no such 
abominations are suffered to live if discovered by the Inspired -- 
unless the teacher and student happen to practice the Path of 
Inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Drifter</b></p>
<p>Drifters are common outside of Riedra. Such a background is often 
tied to a tribal society or the loss of one. But other types of drifters
 inhabit Sarlona.</p>
<p>Syrkarn's natives are often nomads. Syrks can be found in permanent 
settlements, but many come from nomadic people. Wandering is more a 
method of survival than anything else, and such nomads learn less about 
other people than they do about self-reliance and the harshness of the 
natural world. In Syrkarn, though, traveling widely can also teach one a
 diversity of ancient lore, or at least where strange ruins and 
dangerous magical phenomena are located.</p>
<p>Tashanan shifters and humans are much the same, except the lack of 
resources in the Tundra pushes people to move with more regularity. 
Following game animals and securing sites that are good redoubts against
 harsh weather and magical phenomena are important elements to Tashanan 
life. In recent times, the depredations of the Kalaak barbarians have 
forced many Tashanan folk to be mobile or face violence that can be 
worse than murder. Some wander tribeless after Kalaak raids or 
internecine interclan warfare take their toll.</p>
<p>One cannot forget about the Akiak dwarves, betrayed by the Inspired 
in the early days of Riedra and forced into exile in the harsh north. 
Though most Akiaks have settled, no doubt some of them still wander 
forlorn in the wastes, an utterly homeless people. Individual Akiaks, 
especially the young raised on stories of Reidran treachery, roam the 
Tundra to harden and ready themselves for the coming battle.</p>
<p>Adar has its drifters, too. Most of these are tough survivalists and 
mountaineers who live off the land and intermittent hospitality. Some 
are mystics who prefer travel to sedentary meditation. A few of Adar's 
defenders are eternally roving warriors who live and love among the 
peaks, a few even having families as they go. Others who live in the 
winds and rifts of Adar are the unforgiven or grief-stricken, running 
from a crime or loss too great to bear.</p>
<p>In Riedra, drifters are those on the run from authority, and these 
persons must find a new land to call home or face death. Among them 
might be dromites from a destroyed city-hive or a young wilder rooted 
out by the hounds of the Inspired. Sadly, whole groups of Riedrans might
 face this fate if they defy the Inspired for the good of one among 
them. Such defiance is rare.</p>
<p><b>Farmhand</b></p>
<p>The only place in Sarlona where farmhands are truly rare is the 
Tashana Tundra, but Syrkarn follows closely. Syrk settlements do have 
farmers, but many places in the vastness of Syrkarn have no permanent 
settlements. Tribal folk on the Tundra rarely farm, though some 
communities harvest rock lichens, seaweed, or winter grains. Dwarves 
there cultivate fungi in the deeps, and some even maintain hardy herds 
of goats and sheep in the mountains.</p>
<p>Many Riedrans are farmers or general laborers. Such is the lot of 
most folk in an orderly and populous society centered on urbanism -- 
such a civilization often runs on its ability to keep bellies full. This
 axiom becomes doubly important in Riedra under the guidance of the 
divinely motivated Inspired. The Inspired must allocate workers 
appropriately to keep the population fed lest they seem to be 
incompetent. Populations that have their basic needs met are more 
compliant. Interestingly, the farmers and laborers of Riedra don't see 
life as one of menial and demeaning toil, instead acknowledging their 
place in supporting their fellows and moving on the Path of Inspiration.
 In what could possibly be taken as a good in the society the Inspired 
have created, Riedrans honor honest labor on a spiritual level. So, 
Riedran farmhands are likely to be proud of their heritage.</p>
<p>Adarans have a similar spiritual view of work, but they have come to 
this realization through the harsh realities of life among Adar's peaks.
 The Path of Light has had some influence, but Adarans have always 
valued action and competence. This ethic extends to the simplest tasks.</p>
<p><b>Gladiator</b></p>
<p>Gladiators are rare in Sarlona, and most who would qualify for such a
 title aren't and never were slaves. In the rough and lawless Syrk port 
of Ardhmen, pit fighters are common. These hardened combatants make 
their living as pugilists and entertainers in makeshift arenas, usually 
working for a cut of betting pools rather than wages. Pit fights are 
usually between unarmed combatants who don't fight to the death. A few 
unlucky warriors end up on the wrong end of a fixed fight, an 
unfortunate death, or a misplaced bet, and they might be indentured by 
the debt or forced to flee servitude or the wrath of an underworld 
figure. Others see their skills as tools for their own glory, and the 
laurels of adventure seem greater than those of the pit.</p>
<p>The shifters of Tashana long ago abandoned the savage practice of 
gladiatorial contests. Life in the Tundra is simply too harsh to spill 
unnecessary blood. Many of the human barbarian tribes, however, do not 
share this enlightened view. Captured warriors from rival tribes might 
be pitted against one another or against the savage beasts of the 
northern lands.</p>
<p><b>Guttersnipe</b></p>
<p>The Inspired leaders of Riedra would have outsiders believe that 
theirs is a society of perfect order, with everyone provided for and 
none left wanting. But there are exceptions. The Inspired are ruthless 
when dealing with internal "enemies of the state," and entire families 
can be ostracized for political offenses. Often, adults simply 
disappear, leaving children abandoned and on their own. Individuals with
 mixed-blood characteristics, actual or suspected, are often shunned and
 rejected by the state and her people.</p>
<p>The poor of Riedra often fall in with criminal elements such as the 
Dream Merchants in an effort to simply survive. Some become involved 
with the dreamlily trade, and many become addicted to this destructive 
substance. Many of the dissident groups within Riedra actively recruit 
amongst the dispossessed sectors of society. A character with this type 
of background is likely to be affiliated with groups opposed to the 
Riedran leadership.</p>
<p>Riedra is not the only place where the dispossessed are left behind. 
Poverty is rampant in the ramshackle coastal settlements of Whitetooth 
or Winterstead. The unlikely collision of piracy and commerce with the 
seemingly primitive Tundra life has resulted in odd coastal shantytowns 
where the poor and downtrodden struggle to survive among the frigid 
wharves and docks. Separated from their traditional tribal culture, many
 human and shifter families live on the fringes of these nascent cities,
 improvising shelter and scavenging food and clothing. Characters 
hailing from these communities are likely to be extremely resourceful 
and adaptable.</p>
<p> The villages and towns of Syrkarn and Adar's agricultural regions 
also have their permanent underclass. Here the needy haunt the shadows 
of the traveler's inn, begging for scraps, and stealing what they can 
from windowsills and vegetable gardens. Often, these desperate souls 
find their way to the adventuring life by signing onto (or stowing away 
in) passing trade caravans.</p>
<p><b>Mariner</b></p>
<p>Increasing trade and diplomacy between Riedra and the nations of 
Khorvaire have given rise to a new and growing naval presence on the 
coasts of Sarlona. Riedra maintains a significant military navy, with 
regular patrols off the shores of Rhiavhaar and Dor Maleer. Riedran 
sailors are known to be incredibly disciplined and efficient, as are all
 members of the nations' military organizations. A growing merchant 
marine economy has developed in recent years as well, and many sailors 
are assigned by the state to man the sophisticated Riedran cargo ships 
that sail the Sea of Rage to Khorvaire and back again. In recent years, 
an elite class of mariners has been established to transport Riedran 
ambassadors and other officials between the two continents.</p>
<p>The coastal regions of the Tashana Tundra boast a proud mariner 
tradition as well. The port settlements of Whitetooth and Winterstead 
have long been known to harbor vessels from the Lhazaar Principalities, 
facilitating trade that falls outside the purview of official Riedran 
commerce. The maenads of the Tashyvar Islands are particularly renowned 
for their seamanship, piloting their ingenious, shallow-water vessels 
along the shores and inland waterways of the western Tashana shore. 
Inland, the Qiku and Chuniigi shifter tribes fish and travel the 
Tashana's thousands of rivers and lakes in their small <i>yakay </i>boats.</p>
<p>In Adar and Syrkarn, the dozens of fishing villages that dot the 
shorelines have remained virtually unchanged for hundred of years. The 
expert fishing folk of the coast harvest the waters between Sarlona and 
Argonnessen, and some individual captains have initiated limited 
intercontinental trade with Khorvaire. Surprisingly, many mongrel ogre 
tribes in Syrkarn have taken to seafaring. Some have turned to piracy, 
raiding other ships and coastal villages in their enormous keelboats and
 longships.</p>
<p>Characters with a mariner background will be familiar with many of 
the waterways and inland river routes of their particular area of 
Sarlona.</p>
<p><b>Noble Scion</b></p>
<p>Set above the rabble of the workers and commoners of Riedra, the 
Chosen have been touched by the divine force of the nation and selected 
to potentially ascend to the near-divine status of the Inspired. Or so 
they're told. The truth of the matter is much more sinister. The Chosen 
are in actuality "empty vessels" designated as host bodies for the 
extraplanar spirits of Dal Quor. The result of generations of controlled
 breeding and psionic manipulation, these individuals enjoy a life of 
privilege and many advantages denied to the common Riedran.</p>
<p>As the underclasses toil endlessly in hopes of achieving spiritual 
advancement, the Chosen are provided with the best tutors and 
instructors, even servants, to prepare them for the eventual bonding 
process. They are schooled in the great fortress-metropoli of Riedra and
 instructed in a secret language which is actually the unholy tongue of 
the quori. The Chosen share the subtle physical distinctions of the 
Inspired -- delicate features that hint at a trace of elven blood.</p>
<p>Player characters who proceed from this background are among the few 
-- the very few -- who have escaped their awful fate. Those who turn 
from the path of the Chosen are relentlessly hunted and pursued -- by 
the Thousand Eyes if they attempt to hide within Riedra and by the 
Dreaming Dark if they make it past Riedra's borders. Former empty 
vessels carry with them a terrible secret and are likely to be very 
careful indeed about sharing their past with anyone. And they live in 
constant fear of the inevitable day when the quori spirit will attempt 
to reclaim its promised host.</p>
<p>Noble Scions can hail from other regions of Sarlona as well. Many of 
the human and mongrel ogre communities of Syrkarn have their equivalent 
of an aristocratic class, and the maenads of the Tashyvar Islands 
maintain a tradition of noble bloodlines. Even in the mostly egalitarian
 communities of Adar, some are inevitably set above the rest. The 
Keepers of the Word in particular enjoy a relatively cloistered and 
privileged way of life, with certain magical lineages granted elevated 
status.</p>
<p><b>Soldier</b></p>
<p>Sarlona has its share of armies and warriors, but nowhere is the 
military life more pervasive than among the dwarves and duergar of the 
refugee Akiak people. Relentless war with the Riedran occupiers of their
 land has forced virtually every adult to become, essentially, a 
soldier.</p>
<p>In the contested valleys and passes of the Paqaa Mountains, bands of 
Akiak resistance fighters continue their struggle to retake their 
ancestral clanhomes. The Akiak are well-disciplined and extremely 
tenacious fighters. The massive betrayal of the Inspired nearly wiped 
out their nation, and the Akiak are fighting for nothing less than the 
survival of their people. Cunning technologists, the Akiak have 
developed unique alchemical weaponry for use in attacks on the Riedran 
hanbalani and other military targets. Akiak guerilla bands typically 
consist of six to twelve fighters, and they rely on speed and mobility 
to counter the Riedrans' superior numbers. Akiak soldiers learn the arts
 of war not in a training room but on the bloody rocks of the Paqaas.</p>
<p>Riedra itself has a substantial army, most notably the highly-trained
 human fighters of the Harmonious Shield. The Inspired insist upon 
absolute loyalty to the state, and strict discipline is enforced upon 
all soldiers, most of whom are inducted at a very young age. Riedra also
 has a unique fighting force of ronin shifters called the Taskaan -- 
fighters who are bound to an individual Inspired lord and follow a 
samurai-like code of honor.</p>
<p>Adventurers with a background in the Riedran military will almost 
certainly have broken away from their soldiering life at some point, and
 this presents a new set of problems. The Riedran leadership does not 
take kindly to deserters and traitors and has a policy of assigning 
death squads and bounty hunters to pursue those who break from the 
ranks.</p>
<p>In the Tashana, the great shifter nations do not draw a distinction 
between hunting and fighting -- essentially, all able-bodied adults are 
warriors, and each nation is capable of fielding an enormous army at 
short notice. Some individual tribes, however, do have an equivalent of 
the professional soldier. Called sentries, these warriors specialize in 
fighting a particular tribal enemy, such as the Kalaak barbarians of the
 north.</p>
<p><b>Tribal Origin</b></p>
<p>Life revolves around the tribe in the shifter nations of the Tashana 
Tundra. Children are raised by the community as a whole, with each 
member of the tribe participating in the rearing of the young. It is an 
overriding credo of the Tashana that the health of the group is 
paramount, and loyalty to the tribe comes first, even before loyalty to 
blood relatives.</p>
<p>Most tribes of the Tashana, both human and shifter, are at least 
semi-nomadic. In the north, tribes follow the vast herds of caribou that
 wander the grasslands, and some tribes follow a seasonal pattern, 
roaming south in the summer months. Resources are scarce in the Tashana,
 and life is precious. Accordingly, the tribes of the Tundra place great
 value on conservation -- hunters are careful to kill only what is 
needed for the tribe to survive, and those groups that harvest from the 
land or the sea are mindful of preservation. Characters with a tribal 
background from the Tashana region of Sarlona are likely to have a 
profound respect for nature, regardless of their class.</p>
<p>Of the three shifter nations in the Tundra, the Qiku are the largest 
and most established. There are even several permanent settlements in 
the south, built in and around the enormous rock mounds of the 
grasslands. Qiku shifters are particularly known for their 
craftsmanship, especially with musical instruments including flutes, 
pipes, and drums. The coastal Saartuk tribes tend to follow intricate 
nomadic patterns based on the seasonal movements of sea and river fish. 
The most notable exception is the coastal settlement of Wintertooth, a 
permanent trading outpost at the mouth of the Tiiki river. Characters 
with a Saartuk tribal background are likely to have some experience with
 boats and seamanship. The Chuniigi tribes of the north are the most 
warlike of the nations and have been fiercely battling the human Kalaak 
raiders in recent years. Chuniigi characters may tend to aggression and 
violence more than is typical for other Tashanan shifters.</p>
<p>Tribal traditions also exist in Syrkarn, particularly amongst the 
mongrel ogres. Syrkarnan tribes are more territorial than the Tashanans,
 with each tribe controlling a specific piece of land. Much of the 
conflict amongst Sykarn mongrel ogre groups occurs when these lands and 
their borders are contested. Contact and trade with the human 
settlements of Syrkarn have had a curious effect on the mongrel ogre 
tribes, so that the tribes tend to be surprisingly structured and 
lawful.</p>
