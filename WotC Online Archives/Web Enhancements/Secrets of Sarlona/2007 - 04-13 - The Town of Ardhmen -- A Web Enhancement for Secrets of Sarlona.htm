<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Base Camp: The Town of Ardhmen</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The port town of Ardhmen in Syrkarn is a welcome sight 
for those making the months-long sea voyage from Khorvaire. Even so, a 
first impression of this ramshackle collection of fishing huts, tents, 
and patchwork buildings can leave explorers somewhat underwhelmed. 
Ardhmen is more than it appears, however, as detailed by designer Scott 
Fitzgerald Gray. </p>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2004-13%20-%20The%20Town%20of%20Ardhmen%20--%20A%20Web%20Enhancement%20for%20Secrets%20of%20Sarlona_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sarlona is a land of lost histories, contemporary 
intrigues, and clashing cultures, and nowhere is this more evident than 
in Syrkarn. Though nominally a protectorate of Riedra, Syrkarn and its 
people have never been under the direct control of the Inspired. Today, 
this nation is the land of Riedran exiles, native eneko (half-giant 
descendants of the ogre kingdoms of old), and the adventurers who seek 
to uncover Sarlona's secrets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A generation ago, the town of Ardhmen was a fishing 
village built up on the rubble of a city that had flourished and fallen 
twelve hundred years before. Today, the fishing boats and their 
weathered crews still ply the waters off the Syrkarn coast, but their 
huts and drying racks are surrounded by an ever-increasing number of 
farmers, traders, guides, and adventurers. Though still a small town, 
Ardhmen has become perhaps the most important small town in Sarlona. 
Kalashtar returning from Khorvaire to Adar, adventurers hoping to cross 
the frontier into Riedra, and those seeking to explore the wonders of 
Syrkarn itself all start out from Ardhmen's stone docks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ardhmen</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Small Town, Population 1,400-1,600</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><img src="2007%20-%2004-13%20-%20The%20Town%20of%20Ardhmen%20--%20A%20Web%20Enhancement%20for%20Secrets%20of%20Sarlona_files/eb20070409_PortArdhmen.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="492" width="240">"Ardhmen!"
 they called out a half-hour before, but in all that time, you've been 
scanning the horizon to no avail. Your passage has calmed since the ship
 rounded the cape and left the Sea of Rage behind, but though you can 
see other ships ahead, the city remains somehow obscured from your 
sight.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Then you realize suddenly that the reason you can't see the city is that there isn't one. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Before you, the great stone docks of the past eclipse
 a field of fishing cogs and haphazardly scattered neighborhoods of 
canvas, sod, and stone. A half-dozen wood-frame buildings along the 
waterfront rise to a story-and-a-half, but the remainder of the town is 
all single-floored huts and longhouses spread against the setting sun. 
In Stormreach, you remember the ruins climbing skyward from the steep 
shoreline, but the flatness here makes it hard to tell where the shore 
even begins. In Sharn, you've seen house enclaves that took up more 
space than this.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The Gateway to Sarlona, they called it when you 
boarded the ship in Regalport all those months ago. You realize now why 
they were smiling.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Despite its small size and almost complete lack of 
history, Ardhmen serves as the point of arrival for many Khorvairian 
adventurers and explorers bound for Syrkarn and Riedra itself. Most 
legitimate trade ships from Khorvaire make for the major ports of 
Riedra, but the Inspired allow no unauthorized vessels in their waters. 
Ardhmen is likewise the most common starting point for adventurers bound
 for Adar, since its treacherous shores offer few landing sites and 
little protection from the Riedran forces who besiege that land.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Passage to Sarlona from Khorvaire is a long and arduous journey by any means. Chapter One of <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i>
 discusses travel options for Sarlona-bound adventurers, and lists times
 and costs for sea passage from Regalport in the Lhazaar Principalities 
to Ardhmen, the route most commonly taken by those heading for Syrkarn. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Ardhmen was once the site of the great port city of 
Irsthaana in the Kingdom of Lamecha, but the magewars of twelve 
centuries past laid the city waste. What that arcane conflagration 
started, the Inspired-ordered exodus in the aftermath of the Sundering 
completed. Today, only Irsthaana's great stone docks remain, silent 
sentinels jutting out into the green-black waters beyond. Over the 
centuries in which human exiles and eneko tribes resettled this empty 
land, those docks became the site of a fishing village named for the 
eneko sahar who founded it -- Ardhmen. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The first Lhazaar privateers to run the gauntlet of 
Riedran vessels patrolling the Aventus Islands made landfall at Ardhmen 
shortly after the end of the Last War. However, with the dawn of a new 
age of exploration in Khorvaire, Ardhmen has undergone a change in 
strategic importance to which the town and its people are still 
struggling to adapt. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Demographics:</b> Humans 50%, eneko 40% (15% 
permanent, 25% nomadic), kalashtar 3%, dwarves 2%, shifters 2%, other 
(changelings, elves, half-elves, half-orcs, warforged, Chosen) 3%.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Economics:</b> 1,200 gp purchase limit; 10,800 gp asset limit.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because it has a higher-than-average percentage of 
adventurers and explorers passing through it at any given time, Ardhmen 
has a higher gp purchase limit than most towns of its size.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Lay of the Land</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Ardhmen is a deepwater port on the southeast coast of 
Syrkarn. Within the sheltered waters between the twin capes of Syrkarn 
and Adar, Ardhmen is further protected by a ring of rising hills that 
divert the prevailing winds off the Sea of Lost Souls. The great stone 
docks of old Lamecha have stood here for uncounted centuries, but the 
town around them has arisen in a relative heartbeat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The four hundred fisherfolk who earn their living and 
sustenance from the sea are the longest-standing residents of Ardhmen, 
and many of their families lived here when the village was new. The 
thousand-strong population that long ago eclipsed the fishing families 
as Ardhmen's primary residents are the farmers, laborers, sailors, 
traders, and guides who service the Lhazaar privateers plying the Sea of
 Rage with trade goods -- and the adventurers and explorers who travel 
with them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Migrant and seasonal populations make up the balance of 
Ardhmen's people. This includes the aforementioned adventurers, most of 
whom make Ardhmen their base of operations before heading for the 
Tundra, Adar, or the Riedran frontier, and wandering tribes of eneko 
that travel the Syrkarn trade roads throughout the year.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though the town might appear ramshackle, its 
construction is anything but. Syrk culture reflects a deep connection to
 art and architecture that extends from the days of old Sarlona. Whether
 stone, wood, or canvas, the shelters of Ardhmen have a kind of 
utilitarian beauty to them and are built to last a lifetime.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Around the docks, the newer wood-frame buildings of the 
wealthier traders maintain an air of whitewashed respectability amid the
 muck. Things get consistently more disordered as Ardhmen expands out 
toward the hills that separate the town from the sweeping plains beyond.
 Small knots of human fishing huts bump up against the raucous campfires
 of eneko tent enclaves. Clapboard taverns rise alongside sod-walled 
stables and houses of undressed stone, scavenged from the remains of 
ruined buildings lost beneath the wind-whipped grass.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Notable Features</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like Sarlona itself, Ardhmen is unexplored territory, 
and the DM can customize the town to serve the needs of any party or 
campaign. Presented below are a few notable locations, personalities, 
and adventure hooks designed to serve as starting points or additional 
twists in a Sarlona campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gilmaezie's Tavern </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Elves, half-elves, gnomes, halflings, half-orcs, and 
warforged are all but unknown in Sarlona, and Khorvairian explorers of 
those races often feel the foreign nature of this land much more acutely
 than their human and shifter counterparts. Though changelings can be 
found in Riedra, they are rare in Syrkarn, and their high standing in 
the Path of Inspiration means that they often find themselves distrusted
 by native Tashanans, Adarans, and Syrks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For members of the "foreign" races, Gilmaezie's stands 
like a beacon at the edge of a lonely sea. An expatriate Ghallanda 
halfling name Bilborton Gilmaezie is the owner and barkeep of this 
dockside watering hole -- the definitive gathering place for Khorvairian
 adventurers and exiles in Ardhmen. The tavern stocks a better selection
 of Khorvairian spirits than most public houses in Khorvaire, and those 
spirits flow in volumes that help keep prices only 10% above the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 standard. The tavern's main bar and common room can hold upward of two 
hundred people, and the place is rarely less than half full. Whatever 
social and cultural baggage its patrons have carried with them from 
Khorvaire is left outside the tavern's always-open doors.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Aside from his house specialty (a spiced blend of 
spirits known as the Ardhmen Reaper, 5 sp per mug), Gilmaezie is best 
known as a broker of mercenary services. Though sellswords looking to 
ply their trade will find Ardhmen a much poorer market than most cities 
of Khorvaire, adventurers looking to join an expedition or seeking 
compatriots for a mission of their own are well advised to start here.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Gilmaezie's provides a default 
clearinghouse for campaign hooks. PCs newly arrived from Khorvaire with 
no specific plans can find themselves offered employment, overhear 
mysterious rumors, or become the subjects of mistaken identity here. Any
 interaction in Gilmaezie's might be a stepping stone to a Sarlonan 
adventure. See the 50 Sarlona Adventures sidebar in <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i> for ideas.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Opilano's</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Opilano (NG male human expert 4) is the sahar of Ardhmen
 -- the nominal leader of the town and perhaps Syrkarn's most vocal 
ambassador. Recognizable in his ever-present cloak of bright green, the 
portly Opilano is a constant presence greeting travelers on the docks as
 the ships of the principalities come in. Though the trading post he 
founded even before the arrival of the first Lhazaar ships still bears 
his name, its day-to-day operation is left to his daughter Ghillan and 
her eneko husband Ahmax Tumagin. Opilano's is the largest of Ardhmen's 
half-dozen trading posts, all of which carry standard adventuring gear 
and tools and skill kits from the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="300"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="center"><b>The High Cost of Living</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Prices for goods and services in Khorvaire are 
effectively fixed by that land's long-established markets and the 
mercantile strength of the dragonmarked houses. A longsword in Khorvaire
 costs 15 gp because that's the price set by the Cannith guilds whose 
members make them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A world away from the stability of Khorvaire, prices in 
Syrkarn reflect the laws of supply and demand. Characters might find 
themselves on both sides of substantial variations on the standard 
prices for equipment in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and other supplements.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs are buying goods or services in Ardhmen 
(including transport and lodging), the DM should adjust regular prices 
by 1d20-5%. That is, standard pricing can run from 4% lower than normal 
to 15% higher than normal. PCs selling nonmagical gear in Ardhmen should
 have the selling price (normally 50% of the standard) adjusted by 
1d20-15% (from 14% lower to 5% higher than normal).</p>
</td>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Opilano does more trade with 
farmers, hunters, and fishers than with adventurers, but his position as
 sahar keeps him on the lookout for those whose skills might help the 
town (and for those likely to cause trouble). Ardhmen has a loose 
militia consisting of fishers and farmers who can heft a club or flail 
if need be, but Opilano likes to support their numbers by talking 
professional sellswords and adventurers into taking short-term contracts
 as "stalwarts of Ardhmen." In exchange for a minimum one-month 
commitment, Opilano arranges free board at any of the town's many 
rooming houses and a stipend of 10 gp per week per person. The job of 
such stalwarts usually consists of making sure that other gangs of 
adventurers keep the peace, but skirmishes with agents of the Inspired 
are not unheard of.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Brass Dragon</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Run by Elibadhma Galgalmemean (NG male eneko expert 6), 
this smithy and pawnshop is the best place in Ardhmen to buy or sell 
jewelry, armor, and weapons. Elibadhma maintains a virtual lock on the 
Ardhmen armaments market by virtue of being the town's best weaponsmith 
and armorer (+15 Craft [weaponsmithing], +15 Craft [armorsmithing]). 
Though gruff, the eneko loves a good war story and knocks 5% off the 
price of his weapons with a DC 15 Diplomacy or Perform (oratory) check 
made to regale him with tales of adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Elibadhma's skills do not run to
 magic. As a result, he often finds himself in possession of cursed 
weapons unloaded by unscrupulous adventurers. One such blade might be 
resold to a PC, or to an NPC adventurer while the PCs are acting as 
stalwarts of the town.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Green Anvil</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Green Anvil was originally just "The Anvil," but the
 image on its ancient signage long ago turned pale green under the harsh
 Syrkarn sun. The smith Olana (N male human expert 3) has little skill 
beyond the forging of plow blades and horseshoes. However, an exclusive 
arrangement with the eneko who trade among the wandering half-giant 
smiths of the Andnemun Desert gives him a corner on the market for 
masterwork arms in Ardhmen. What few realize is that Olana underwrites 
his profits as a weaponer with a well-established dreamlily smuggling 
operation, shipping the drug to Khorvaire through contacts on the 
Lhazaar ships.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Smuggling dreamlily is becoming 
an increasingly dangerous game in Sarlona, and against the likes of the 
Dream Merchants, Olana is out of his league. The smith-turned-smuggler 
might seek the PCs' aid if the Dream Merchants come for him, or he might
 attempt to frame the party for a smuggling job gone bad.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Hawk and Moon</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Though the smugglers and black marketeers known as the 
Dream Merchants are rare outside the bastion cities of Riedra, they 
maintain a quiet presence on the outskirts of Ardhmen. A DC 20 Gather 
Information check will direct PCs seeking to buy or sell "unique" items 
to the Hawk and Moon, a junk shop whose dusty wares hint that its most 
profitable deals are done under the counter. The Hawk's proprietor 
Dhasuun (CN male human expert 4/rogue 2) is the Dream Merchants' agent 
in Ardhmen and can be a vital resource for PCs seeking information on 
Riedra -- especially those hoping to cross the often dangerous 
Syrkarn-Riedra frontier. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Dhasuun is the only source in Ardhmen for the special substances and items of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>.
 However, he does most of his business in magic and psionic items, and 
in the mundane necessities more important than magic to adventurers in 
Riedra. Chief among these are Riedran traveling papers, for which 
Dhasuun is one of the few reputable sources in all Syrkarn. Dhasuun's 
papers are identical to those purchased through the Dream Merchants in 
Riedra, but they cost a premium of 600 gp each. Dhasuun can also provide
 notarized <i>sentira</i> parchment at 250 gp per sheet, and will forge a
 visa for another 75 gp. Dhasuun's forgery skills are exceptional, 
however, and his work can be revealed only by a DC 25 Search check.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Dhasuun can get his hands on any magic or psionic item 
up to 10,000 gp in value (at the DM's discretion) in 2d4-1 weeks. He 
charges a 10% premium for such items over and above their standard cost.
 As well, he happily purchases any magic or psionic items the Dream 
Merchants can resell in Riedra. Such items can be sold for the full 50% 
of their normal value, though cash in excess of Ardhmen's 10,800 gp 
asset limit will take Dhasuun 1d4 days to procure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks: </b>Outside his mercantile 
activities, Dhasuun's job is to ensure that the robust trade in Ardhmen 
never threatens the Dream Merchants' established operations. As such, he
 watches for any signs of PCs attempting to smuggle goods in or out of 
Riedra itself, and he has no qualms about clandestinely directing agents
 of the Thousand Eyes to those he finds suspicious. On more than one 
occasion, Dhasuun is rumored to have sold adventurers Riedran traveling 
papers, then sent them straight to a waiting patrol on the far side of 
the frontier.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Volgo's Voice of Khorvaire</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Volgo Kyrinala (CN male gnome expert 5/rogue 5) is a 
former House Sivis heir who has established a communications link 
between his stationery shop and notary's office in Ardhmen and the Sivis
 message stations of Khorvaire. Volgo curses his former house 
incessantly, telling how he was excoriated after being falsely accused 
of selling sensitive military communications in the dying days of the 
Last War. Now, his operation is designed in some small part to 
complicate his former house's official dealings with the Inspired.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A staff of a half-dozen expatriate Sivis heirs (all with the <i>whispering wind </i>ability of the lesser Mark of Scribing) keeps Volgo's four <i>speaking stones</i>
 active around the clock. The great distance between Sarlona and 
Khorvaire means that messages often take up to three days to cross the 
sea, so Volgo does a brisk business with the <i>sending</i> ability of his own greater mark. Messages sent by <i>speaking stone</i>
 cost the normal 5 gp per page, though clients can pay a flat 20 gp 
surcharge to avoid the service's 1d4-day backlog. Volgo charges an 
inflated 350 gp for each use of his <i>sending</i> ability, which he can use once per day.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some speculate that Volgo and his staff might actually 
be clandestine operatives working for House Sivis, not against them. The
 pretense of the gnome's hostile mercantilism could simply be a canny 
attempt to do an end run around the Thousand Eyes' close watch over 
Sivis's only official enclave in Dar Jin.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Since Volgo began operations, 
one of his assistants has been keeping secret copies of any particularly
 interesting messages she sends. Though the young gnome has no overall 
goals beyond an obsessive interest in other people's business, agents of
 the Thousand Eyes have recently gained access to her diaries, which 
include knowledge of any messages the PCs have sent or received.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summit Road Safe House</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Summit Road is the secret organization charged with 
gathering intelligence in the defense of Adar and escorting travelers 
through the defenses that guard the mountain refuge. Every visitor to 
Ardhmen hears rumors that Summit guides are plentiful in the town, but 
these rumors are never spread by the guides themselves. Those guides who
 are active in Ardhmen encourage (and in some cases even start) false 
rumors regarding the Summit Road's presence in the region, keeping the 
organization's real activities hidden beneath a screen of speculation.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Longtime residents of Ardhmen know for fact that a 
Summit Guide safe house exists within the town, but its location has yet
 to be exposed. In part, this is because the Summit Road operates not 
one but four separate safe houses in Ardhmen, only one of which sees use
 at any given time. Summit Road guides are stationed at one of four 
different rooming houses in a randomly rotating schedule, allowing them 
to constantly shift their base of operations in Ardhmen and keep their 
activities hidden from prying eyes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> The Summit Road will likely play
 a part in the plans of any adventurers bound for Adar, but PCs seeking 
Summit guides might have their work cut out for them. Alternatively, PCs
 checking into an innocuous rooming house might find themselves 
incorrectly identified as Summit Road sympathizers by Riedran agents 
believing they have cracked the organization's veil of secrecy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Three Branch Council</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As Ardhmen's importance as an international port of call
 grows, Adarans, Tashanans, and Syrks alike have begun to send 
delegations to the town to discuss the common issues their people share 
while living in the shadow of Riedra. These meetings take place four 
times per year in Three Branch House, an upscale rooming house whose 
owner Yrdivan (CG male human psion 1/expert 2) is a Riedran exile with a
 passionate hatred of the Inspired.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Councils are typically chaotic affairs, and infighting 
between allied factions (particularly the shifters and dwarves of the 
Tundra) is common. Despite that, the councils are an effective 
clearinghouse for intelligence of Thousand Eyes activities along the 
frontiers and within Riedra itself. Members in active opposition to 
Inspired rule also use the council as a forum for their own views 
(whether true or not), hoping to spread their hatred of the lords of 
Riedra across Sarlona and beyond.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Virtually anyone can participate in the Three Branch 
Council, but knowledge that Riedra maintains a constant watch on Ardhmen
 (as it does all Syrkarn) means that members typically make no effort to
 hide their activities. Instead, they trust in detection magic and 
psionics to weed out spies, and in the expectation that the Thousand 
Eyes will risk no direct confrontation in a town so densely populated 
(for Syrkarn, at any rate). So far, the Thousand Eyes has allowed the 
Three Branch Council its freedom, though many suspect this only proves 
that the council's plans must inadvertently serve the interests of 
Riedra in some way.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Despite the openness of its 
operations, the Three Branch Council is involved with a number of covert
 operations and clandestine activities. Whether native Sarlonans or 
Khorvairian observers, PCs wishing to take part in the council will be 
welcomed (or possibly even recruited) by one of its regional factions. 
In particular, characters who have come up against the Inspired or their
 agents in Khorvaire can use the council as a means of taking the fight 
to their foes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the same time, the unified front presented by the 
council's fluctuating membership hides deep divisions between the 
Adarans (who live at constant war with Riedra) and the Tashanans and 
Syrks (who have much to lose should they decide to formally join that 
war). PCs with a connection to Adar might discover that the Three Branch
 Council has secret ties to Riedra and is designed to weaken the defense
 of the mountain land.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Barnan's Boathouse</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Syrkarn's east coast is well traveled by fishing boats 
and smaller craft. "Brinehand" Barnan (LN male dwarf warrior 3/expert 2)
 is a seafaring Tashanan whose thickly muscled arms can pull a scull 
faster than most of his kin can run. The deep-keeled sloops he builds 
and hires are his own custom design. Half the size of a standard 
keelboat, they are weighted and balanced specifically for the often 
treacherous open water between Syrkarn and Adar, and they can maintain a
 speed of 4 miles per hour under sail.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A hired ship has a crew of six and can carry up to 
twelve passengers and their gear at a rate of 1 sp per mile. Barnan's 
crews travel north only as far as the mouth of the River Qitha, since 
they have no interest in drawing the attention of the Riedran forts that
 line Jathara Sound beyond.</p>
<p align="LEFT">PCs who have brought their own transportation from 
Khorvaire can hire Barnan to oversee necessary repairs while in port. 
The crews Barnan hires (typically experienced sailors from the 
fisherfolk families) are first-rate and can handle virtually any work 
that might be needed after a rough sea crossing. Barnan and his crews 
can do mundane repairs on airships and elemental galleons, but there are
 no facilities or NPCs in Ardhmen capable of repairing the 
bound-elemental workings of such vessels.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Barnan's crews do not engage 
Riedran forces or attempt the dangerous crossing to Adar under any 
circumstances, but characters are free to buy one of his ships outright 
(3,000 gp). Adar is a land at war, however, and strangers intent on 
sailing there should give its settlements (particularly the secret port 
at Dvaarnava) a wide berth.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Within Ardhmen itself, Barnan can prove a useful ally 
for PCs who have a vessel of their own that needs repairs or docking 
while the party heads inland. Though Barnan is unscrupulously honest, 
PCs might find themselves caught up in intrigue if their vessel becomes a
 target for thieves, smugglers, or operatives of the Thousand Eyes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Madrasyla</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Though eneko make up a good portion of the permanent 
residents of Ardhmen, the nomadic culture of the mongrel ogres sees a 
constant flow of traders and laborers moving through the town. The 
nomadic eneko tribes have established a permanent tent city at the edge 
of town on a plain they call Madrasyla ("the high ground" in an ancient 
Giant dialect). There, a constantly shifting population of traders, 
herders, and laborers thrives. The human farmsteads that surround 
Ardhmen rely heavily on migrant eneko labor for their year-round 
equatorial growing season. Many of those eneko with primary vocations as
 herders, hunters, or traders still spend some of their time in Ardhmen 
working the wheat fields and the sepse crops.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the constant influx of new wanderers gradually 
pushes Madrysala's population past some unofficial threshold, its 
longstanding residents take to the open road again. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> The constant turnover of its 
population makes Madrasyla an excellent source of up-to-date information
 on the lands beyond Ardhmen. In particular, PCs seeking information on 
the yuan-ti or the cults of Karrak the Final Guardian can often find 
newly arrived nomads in Madrasyla whose travels have brought them into 
contact with these groups.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The eneko are a social and civilized people, but 
explorers from Khorvaire are often unsure how to approach these gentle 
giants. Syrk culture involves an almost ceremonial degree of 
confrontation, argument, and standing down that takes some getting used 
to. As a result, violence too often ensues when Khorvairian adventurers 
find themselves confronted by apparently angry eneko whose only goal is 
to assess a newcomer's character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Whispering Arch</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A quarter-mile past the nominal outskirts of town, a 
great stone arch rises over the dusty trade road. Thought to have marked
 the start of some great thoroughfare of the ancient city, it is the 
only structure beyond the docks to have withstood arcane conflict and 
the ravages of time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Travelers who approach Ardhmen along the road by night 
sometimes tell of hearing faint sound as they draw close. From the 
darkness ahead comes the distant noise of a bustling port city -- ships'
 bells, uncounted voices, the clack of wagon wheels, and the roar of 
beasts exotic and mundane. Invariably, the phantom noise fades away when
 any creature passes within 100 feet of the arch. However, it is well 
known in Ardhmen that characters who spend a full night within that 
range receive a +10 circumstance bonus on a single Knowledge (local 
Syrkarn) or bardic knowledge check made at dawn the next day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> Though PCs can make use of the 
whispering arch as they seek information helpful to the mission at hand,
 the old magic here sometimes has a mind of its own. Characters camping 
within sight of the arch or passing through it might be suddenly 
stricken with visions of the old city of Irsthaana. Such visions might 
provide the party with important clues to the location of an ancient 
relic, or inspire contact with a current-day descendant of some figure 
of Sarlona's distant past.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Docks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Many have speculated on how the old city of Irsthaana 
could have been so completely reduced to rubble by time and weather 
while its millennia-old docks continue to stand as strong as the day 
they were built. Though the docks radiate faint conjuration magic, none 
have explained how such a minor dweomer could protect against the 
ravages of long centuries. What none suspect is that the conjuration in 
question does not protect the docks, but simply serves as the conduit to
 a spirit of the Elemental Plane of Earth bound within the stones 
themselves. The spirit constantly replenishes the strength and structure
 of the docks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks:</b> The ancient process by which 
elemental strength was bound within the Ardhmen docks differs greatly 
from the elemental binding of the gnomes of Zilargo, and the 
juxtaposition of these two techniques can cause instability. Elemental 
vessels are exceedingly rare in Ardhmen, but PCs with a wind galleon or 
airship might see their vessel's bound elemental break free of its 
confinement while in proximity to the magic of the docks. Alternatively,
 the appearance of a wild zone in the harbor might interfere with the 
docks' protective elemental magic. As the stone of the docks begins to 
decay at an advanced rate, it threatens ships in port as well as the 
future of the town itself.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Thousand Eyes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Riedra has no official presence in Syrkarn, but its 
agents are known to watch that land with an unceasing vigilance. 
However, unlike the clandestine operatives spread across most areas of 
Syrkarn, the artist and sculptor Jhaazari (LN female Chosen expert 
3/psion 2/fist of Dal Quor 1) is known as an agent of the Inspired 
within Ardhmen, and she makes no effort to keep her motives and 
allegiance secret.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most folk in Ardhmen engage in honest business that they
 know should cause the Inspired no trouble, and they are happy to have 
Jhaazari report that back to her masters. Those who oppose the rule of 
the Inspired in Riedra and their constant eye on Syrkarn take a less 
charitable view of her activities, but are more concerned with 
discovering the identities of the secret accomplices they know she must 
have.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks: </b>At any given time, there are up to five <i>mind seeded</i>
 Riedran spies in Ardhmen. Three of these are a rotating crew of 
Thousand Eyes agents who come and go in the guise of travelers, 
explorers, and sellswords working the trade roads. Inspired agents 
returning from clandestine duty in Khorvaire often travel through 
Ardhmen rather than Dar Jin in order to follow and report on the 
activities of high-level Khorvairian adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The other two Inspired agents are among the NPCs 
mentioned above. The DM should determine which of the townsfolk are 
secretly agents of the Thousand Eyes -- and what their orders and 
mission might be.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b> Fist of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Looking to start a Sarlonan campaign? Planning on using <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i>
 to provide a boost to a kalashtar PC or the Riedran villains dogging a 
party's plans in Khorvaire? The fist of Dal Quor prestige class is a 
character option well worth considering. As warriors on the front lines 
of a thousand-year conflict, the fists define the elite combat 
traditions of two races dedicated to each other's destruction. Learn 
more in this overview by the class's designer, Scott Fitzgerald Gray.</p>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2004-13%20-%20The%20Town%20of%20Ardhmen%20--%20A%20Web%20Enhancement%20for%20Secrets%20of%20Sarlona_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p align="LEFT">The fists of Dal Quor prestige class represents not one 
but two martial traditions -- that of the kalashtar who fight for their 
lives and freedom in Sarlona and beyond, and of the Chosen and Inspired 
lords of Riedra whose quori masters hunt those kalashtar. Groomed as 
elite warriors and the leaders of the most dangerous missions in their 
endless conflict, the fists of Dal Quor seek any advantage in combat and
 are known for fiercely hunting down opposing fists in the enemy ranks.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Development Notes: Kalashtar Fists of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When I received the opportunity to take on my first freelance design project for Wizards of the Coast, <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i> was one of four books up for grabs -- and the one I most desperately wanted to work on. Despite having edited a fair chunk of <b>Eberron</b> material over the previous two years, Sarlona remained as much of an enigma for me as it was for any <b>Eberron</b> DM or player. Tantalizing glimpses inside the Quor Tarai<i></i>in <i>Races of Eberron</i>, the dark secrets held by the Riedran monolith in <i>Explorer's Handbook</i>, cool prestige classes like the quori mindhunter in <i>Magic of Eberron</i> -- every secret revealed about the mysterious homeland of the Inspired simply whets the appetite for more.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sarlona was a blank slate that the design team had the 
enviable job of having to fill, weaving together a rich tapestry of 
forgotten histories, complex politics, lost races, and dark legends. As 
the book took shape, it began to focus more and more on the intricate 
complexity of this strange land. Thus, it was kind of ironic that when 
it came time to sketch out a quori/kalashtar-related prestige class, the
 idea that finally took root in my mind was a fairly simple one.</p>
<p align="LEFT">By their naturally psionic nature and cultural history, 
Kalashtar PCs and empty vessel villains are perfectly suited for any 
number of psionic prestige classes. <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> and <i>Complete Psionic</i>
 both present useful options for psionic kalashtar PCs and the Chosen 
masterminds they fight against. At the same time, however, psionics adds
 a level of complexity to a campaign that can be daunting, especially 
for many beginning players.</p>
<p align="LEFT">After quickly abandoning a handful of ideas that really 
just seemed to be attempting to put a Sarlonan spin on what had already 
been done, the idea came to me of using the kalashtar's psionic 
potential to create a prestige class built on the martial traditions of 
that race. Though it would play to the kalashtar's psionic heritage, the
 fist of Dal Quor was all about getting the job done in brutally 
efficient physical fashion. As I said in one of the voluminous 
IM/email/message board exchanges between Keith Baker, Glenn McDonald, 
Chris Sims, and myself that accompanied our design work on <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i>:
 "I personally love the complicated prestige classes with initiation 
rituals and fifteen levels of bureaucracy and a thousand words of 
organization details, but sometimes you just want to beat things up."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Underlying the class was the idea that kalashtar PCs 
often make a basic choice between acknowledging or ignoring their 
psionic heritage. For those kalashtar characters not interested in 
taking levels in a psionic class or prestige class (including those 
characters playing in a nonpsionic campaign), the fist of Dal Quor 
provides a way to acknowledge the kalashtar's psionic nature in a 
different way.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From Concept to Execution</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sarlona is a land virtually unknown to those in Khorvaire, and one of the biggest challenges that the <i>Secrets of Sarlona </i>design
 team faced was how to write a book that revealed some of those secrets 
but still maintained Sarlona's status as a land of mystery. With that in
 mind, the fists of Dal Quor became members of a secret martial 
tradition. Elite warriors of the kalashtar, the fists would lead 
mainstream forces in Adar or undertake solo missions against the elite 
Chosen of Riedra -- those who the kalashtar refer to mockingly as "empty
 vessels."</p>
<p align="LEFT">On the face of it, the fist of Dal Quor bears a 
superficial similarity to any number of "bruiser" prestige classes. 
However, a fist's martial prowess and special abilities stem not from 
rigid battlefield training but from the psionic nature of his very 
spirit. Just as the monk channels <i>ki</i> into unique combat skills, the fist of Dal Quor channels the essence of the Region of Dreams on the battlefield.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the same time, the class had to remain open to all 
sides of kalashtar culture and history. The mountains of Adar are home 
to monastic traditions that predate the Inspired's arrival in Sarlona, 
but the kalashtar's favored class is psion. In considering class 
abilities, it was important for this combat-oriented class to allow a 
character to build on his existing strengths rather than simply turn him
 into a psionically powered brawler.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Though many fists of Dal Quor build on the psionic 
traditions of their people, this class is first and foremost a martial 
one. Chosen and Kalashtar fists channel their natural psionic potential 
into fearsome combat abilities, allowing them to strike for maximum 
damage and efficiency. Though it places them front and center in their 
people's thousand-year war, this class also offers characters the 
freedom to fight that war on their own terms.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Becoming a Kalashtar Fist of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As befits the elite troops in a war whose front lines 
stretch from Adar to Khorvaire, every fist of Dal Quor brings something 
different to his pursuit of the class. Likewise, every fist uses the 
class's strengths and signature abilities in his own way.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For a kalashtar PC with a martial bent, the fist of Dal 
Quor makes an excellent option. The class's d10 Hit Die provides 
necessary staying power on the battlefield, while its base attack 
progression keeps pace with all but the most heavily combat-oriented 
classes. At the same time, psions, wizards, and other characters seeking
 to increase their combat prowess find the fist of Dal Quor a better 
option than taking multiclass levels in fighter, or than pursuing 
martial prestige classes (such as those found in <i>Complete Warrior</i>) whose prerequisites they typically have trouble meeting.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The fist of Dal Quor's entry requirements are designed 
to provide a degree of consistent background among members of the class.
 At the same time, those requirements allow entry by a wide range of 
character types.</p>
<ul>
<li> The fists of Dal Quor must be Chosen, Inspired, or kalashtar.<br><br></li>
<li> A base attack bonus of +4 provides easy entry to the 
combat-oriented classes, but also allows an 8th-level psion or wizard to
 help herself to a combat edge that her foes will never see coming.<br><br></li>
<li>Knowledge (the planes) 4 ranks is a cross-class investment for most 
classes. This study represents the prospective fist's dedicated focus on
 his connection to the power of Dal Quor.<br><br></li>
<li>A fist of Dal Quor must have taken any one psionic feat. In a 
psionic campaign, characters have a wide range of choices. In a 
nonpsionic campaign, the Kalashtar Mindlink or Quori Dread feats from <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i> make good selections for a kalashtar PC.<br><br></li>
<li>Proficiency with any martial or exotic weapon requires an additional
 feat for many noncombat types, but covers the traditional combat 
classes (psionic and nonpsionic), the monk, and the soulknife (whose 
mind blade is treated as an exotic weapon for the purpose of gaining 
entry to this class).</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Soulknives and psychic warriors of the prerequisite 
races are perhaps the most obvious candidates for entry into the fists 
of Dal Quor, but any monk or rogue can take up the path with the 
requisite study and a single psionic feat. Even more esoteric 
combinations suggest themselves. A rare kalashtar barbarian could take 
this class to add stunning strike and sudden strike damage to the 
rage-fueled devastation he deals on the battlefield.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Playing a Kalashtar Fist of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Though every character taking up the fist of Dal Quor 
path will find their own way to make best use of the class's abilities, 
there are a number of key concepts that can be kept in mind.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hit Fast, Hit Hard</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The path of the fist of Dal Quor is a martial tradition,
 and those who follow it do so with only one end in mind. Though his 
reasons for getting into combat can be many and varied, a fist of Dal 
Quor fights only to win. Characters limited in their damage potential by
 low Strength can make great use of the class's sudden strike ability. 
Those characters who rely on Dexterity and the Weapon Finesse feat for 
their attacks can use sudden strike to make up the difference on damage,
 while characters already dealing impressive Strength-based damage (or 
those who have a sneak attack or sudden strike from another class) 
become even more deadly.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Old One-Two</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The fist of Dal Quor's stunning strike and sudden strike
 abilities are designed to be used in concert -- a successful stunning 
strike denies a foe his Dexterity bonus to AC so that a sudden strike's 
extra damage can take him out. (If you have only the minimum +4 base 
attack bonus when you take up this class, you gain the extra attack at 
3rd level that allows you to combine these abilities to full effect.) In
 melee combat, you likely target one foe at a time, making it important 
to coordinate attacks with your allies -- and trust those allies to 
cover your back while you focus on the most dangerous foes.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" width="300"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Development Notes: Chosen Fists of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Designed to be equally attractive to martial characters 
and manifesters alike, the fists of Dal Quor quickly took shape as the 
elite warriors of the kalashtar. These would be the squad leaders and 
covert agents who take the fight to the Chosen -- those from which the 
Inspired arise, bitterly named by the kalashtar as "empty vessels."</p>
<p align="LEFT">However, this line of thought led to an immediate 
question. If the fists of Dal Quor were the elite forces in the 
kalashtar's war against the Inspired, who exactly were they fighting? 
Where were the equally elite combat troops that Riedra would have 
arrayed against the kalashtar fists? Even if <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i> 
had the space for an additional Chosen-only prestige class, such a class
 would have been of primary interest only to DMs, and so was a 
nonstarter from a design perspective.</p>
<p align="LEFT">However, Keith Baker had a touchstone that the <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i>
 design team came back to again and again -- what we came to call the 
idea of "shades of gray." In Eberron, things should never simply be 
black-and-white, right-or-wrong, neat-and-tidy. Eberron is 
contradictions, contrasts, moral dilemmas. And so it occurred to me to 
wonder -- given how much the Chosen and the kalashtar hate each other, 
wouldn't it be interesting to create a tradition that actually unites 
them in some way? Imagine a single common thread between these two 
bitter enemies -- a military tradition that crosses over cultural and 
racial lines, and that both sides lay claim to even as they decry the 
other as usurpers of their birthright.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From Concept to Execution</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">With the mechanics already in place, developing the 
fists of Dal Quor as a twofold tradition became mostly a matter of 
filling out the class's background material. However, the origins of the
 class have been intentionally left open and ultimately up the DM's 
interpretation. Both sides of the kalashtar-Chosen divide see themselves
 as the true champions of the fist of Dal Quor path, and they each view 
the other race as having stolen the tradition. As a result, fists of 
either race have an automatic nemesis in each other.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The most significant difference between the two 
traditions was an obvious one. Since the Inspired allow no inkling or 
mention of any connection between themselves and the power of their 
quori masters, the Riedran fists of Dal Quor could use that name only 
within their own ranks. To all others, the Riedran fists are the 
Sentinels of Inspiration, the legendary vanguard in the war against 
those who oppose the path of Inspiration and seek to return Riedra to 
chaos.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For a DM seeking to create a memorable combat-centered 
villain, a Riedran fist of Dal Quor is a good choice. Riedran fists are 
active in Adar, Syrkarn, and even Khorvaire itself, using infiltration 
and assassination to disrupt the flow of information and resources 
between Adar and its allies. At the same time, remember that things in 
Eberron should never be cut-and-dried. As members of an elite order 
built on great secrecy, the Riedran fists have the potential to play 
against type and expectation. For example, a Chosen within the ranks of 
the fists of Dal Quor may not have bonded yet with a quori spirit. Such 
an NPC might become one of the exceedingly rare Chosen who reject the 
teachings of Inspiration, horrified by the revelation of quori power in 
Riedra. Such a character might even become an ally to PCs opposing 
Inspired rule.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A fist of Dal Quor can be as much about subtlety as raw 
destruction, however. Because its power derives from your own psionic 
potential, your stunning strike works just as well with ranged weapons 
as melee weapons. Remember also that your sudden strike can be used 
against ranged-attack targets (including those stunned by your initial 
attack) within 30 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Valor Is the Better Part of Discretion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Your psionic potential drew you to the tradition of the 
fists for a reason. No matter what your original calling, you are a 
warrior now, and the stakes are often higher than just life or death. 
When you fight in your own defense, you might give quarter to the foe 
foolish enough to attack you in the first place. When you fight the war 
of your people against those who would see you destroyed, death on one 
side or the other is the only outcome.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>When the Battle Is Done</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Almost as important as your combat prowess is your 
reputation as a fist of Dal Quor, though this reputation might not 
always be an asset. Among the kalashtar, the fists of Dal Quor are given
 wide-ranging respect and can expect aid or assistance from any who know
 them. Among strangers, however, a fist of Dal Quor is often cautious 
about revealing his calling. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Kalashtar must be perpetually wary of attempts to 
infiltrate their ranks. In the past, Chosen fists of Dal Quor have made 
attempts to enter the mountain strongholds of Adar and disrupt kalashtar
 operations in Khorvaire by posing as kalashtar fists. Furthermore, 
kalashtar fists whose identities are known often find themselves targets
 of the Inspired in Sarlona and Khorvaire alike. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Two Traditions</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The fists of Dal Quor prestige class represents not one 
but two martial traditions -- that of the kalashtar who fight for their 
lives and freedom in Sarlona and beyond, and of the Chosen and Inspired 
lords of Riedra whose quori masters hunt those kalashtar. Groomed as 
elite warriors and the leaders of the most dangerous missions in their 
endless conflict, the fists of Dal Quor seek any advantage in combat and
 are known for fiercely hunting down opposing fists in the enemy ranks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Becoming a Chosen Fist of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like their kalashtar counterparts, Riedran fists run the
 range from hardened soulknives and psychic warriors seeking to hone 
their existing combat skills, to psion agents of the Thousand Eyes whose
 missions require a covert warrior's skills.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As with a kalashtar fist of Dal Quor, the more unusual 
class combinations are sometimes the most effective. Kalashtar agents in
 Sharn might be quick to suspect a well-muscled and well-armed Riedran 
warrior of being a covert agent of the Sentinels of Inspiration, even as
 an unremarkable psion fist of Dal Quor passes them by without notice.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Playing a Chosen Fist of Dal Quor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Earlier, you read a general overview for playing a 
kalashtar fist of Dal Quor, and the same advice holds true for the 
Riedran fists. However, whether you're a player looking to bend the 
rules by playing a Chosen PC or a DM in search of a memorable villain, 
you need to keep few things in mind when playing a Chosen fist.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Pride and Purpose</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the end, the strengths of the Chosen fists of Dal 
Quor are often their greatest liabilities as well. As elite warriors of 
Riedra, the fists of Dal Quor occupy the upper tiers of that society's 
rigid class structure. They are the best of the best and they know it --
 and everyone beneath them is expected to know it, too. This sense of 
entitlement is often well deserved, since the ranks of the Sentinels of 
Inspiration include some of Riedra's deadliest soldiers. However, 
despite the harmonious ideals of Riedran society, Chosen fists can find 
themselves the target of jealousy and spite. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A typical upper-echelon operative of the Thousand Eyes 
or the Harmonious Shield is a member of a rigidly hierarchical military 
caste. His missions are assigned him, and his career depends largely on 
his ability to follow orders. While the fists of Dal Quor answer to the 
command of the Harmonious Shield, they are typically tied to no specific
 unit or assignment. Even those fists tasked with specific missions of 
espionage or assassination have great latitude in how they carry out 
their orders -- and in the secondary assignments they set for 
themselves. As a result, Chosen fists who find themselves in need of 
assistance are often loath to ask for it, and such requests are 
sometimes met with polite indifference by commanders quietly envious of a
 fist's position and privilege.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Strategies and Tactics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Though curious, rendesa avoid contact with the humanoids
 whose territory they often share. If threatened, however, they defend 
themselves fiercely, with males typically taking the fight to attackers 
while the females and young escape to safe ground. When danger presents 
itself, rendesas manifest their <i>inertial armor</i> ability, using <i>mindlink</i> to instinctively coordinate their attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sample Encounters</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Raised by the Inspired as elite mounts and guard 
animals, rendesas are commonly seen in the service of Inspired and 
Chosen in Riedra. However, herds of these creatures still roam wild 
across the Sarlonan plains.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Individual (EL 4):</b> Lone rendesas (often male) are
 seen wandering the Sarlonan plains from the Tundra to Syrkarn. Among 
the half-giants of Syrkarn's northern steppes, these wanderers are seen 
as an omen of imminent change -- sometimes good, sometimes ill.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Herd (EL 8):</b> Migratory herds of rendesas 
typically consist of six adults (males and females in equal number) and 
as many foals and yearlings. The suggested Encounter Level assumes three
 adult males and two yearling males (treat as an adult with only two 
hoof attacks) defending the females and young.</p>

<p align="LEFT">24 Rendesas have a wealth of psionic abilities all their own, and woe be to any who attempt to harm them.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The graceful rendesas are native to Sarlona, but their 
origins are a mystery. Some believe they are descended from creatures of
 Dal Quor who escaped from that plane before its connection to Eberron 
was severed. Others claim that the merging of quori spirits and a 
now-extinct Sarlonan steed brought them into being.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Rendesas are migratory, moving north to south as winter 
advances across temperate Sarlona. They have no set migratory routes, 
however, since they are intelligent enough to not overgraze their 
fragile feeding grounds. As a result, they are rarely seen in the same 
place in successive years.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Environment:</b> Rendesa herds wander the temperate and warm plains of Sarlona, from the southern Tundra to the Lamecha lowlands in Syrkarn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Typical Physical Characteristics:</b> An adult male 
rendesa stands some 8 feet tall and can weigh up to 2,500 pounds. 
Females are only slightly smaller. Their range of color is uniform, from
 ghost-white to a pearly gray, but many rendesas are dappled with 
distinctive black or blue markings. Both males and females possess the 
species' distinctive horns, which appear at about a year old.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A rendesa's psi-like abilities also do not manifest 
until one year of age. Captured young are thus extremely valuable, since
 they have fewer abilities with which to defend themselves.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alignment:</b> Rendesas are usually lawful neutral. They carry themselves with a grace that seems to exceed their limited intelligence.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Typical Treasure</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Rendesas neither carry nor store treasure of their own. 
However, they are in high demand as mounts outside Riedra (within that 
nation, only the Inspired and Chosen ride them) -- a rendesa foal can 
fetch a high price from horse traders in the Tundra and Syrkarn.</p>
