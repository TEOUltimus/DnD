<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="390"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size2">A cloaked figure steps into the path ahead and assumes a
 challenging stance with his guisarme at attention. Face and body hidden
 within folds of midnight cloth, the menace presents a mysterious 
bearing likely to put anyone immediately on edge. </p>
<p class="size2">You don't see him move, but suddenly, the cloak falls 
away, rippling downward to pool at his feet. He wears black, studded 
leather, second-skin breeches, and a thick vest over a loosely woven 
cassock that flows close to his skin --- all sleekly designed for 
silence and grace. He has trim muscles like those of a cat. White-blond 
hair caps his head, cut short in angry spikes. His winter gaze pins you 
in place with a confident directness that tells you he means business.</p>
<p class="size2">The challenger points at you with one gloved hand. You 
notice a subtle flick of his wrist and the barest flash of movement at 
the corner of your eye. An obsidian-handled dagger thunks near you. It 
seems you've been challenged.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">As the DM, you may pause between reading each of the above paragraphs to allow PCs a chance to converse with their challenger.</p>
<p class="size2">The weapon master could have any reason for challenging
 the party, and the PCs may manage to avoid the conflict altogether 
through careful conversation. Define the scene according to the weapon 
master's alignment. You could make this a scene of intensive 
roleplaying, weave it into a mystery your players are trying to solve, 
or turn it into a one-on-one combat challenge for a single PC. For a 
richer story, give the weapon master a distinct motive for his attack. 
He is, after all, risking his life. See Encounter Ideas, below, for some
 suggestions on how to build a story around the weapon master. This 
weapon master has a minimum Challenge Rating of 7.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tactics</b></p>
<p class="size2">The weapon master designed for this particular 
encounter began his training as a fighter. He relies strongly on both 
his agility and his strength, however, to overcome his opponents. Fancy 
moves, diversions and feints all play an important role in this weapon 
master's tactics. Standard fighters tend to step into battle and hack 
away on one opponent until it's dead. This weapon master prefers to move
 around more, spread his attacks among various opponents (if he has more
 than one), and make his enemy follow his movements. Because his Armor 
Class never gets very high, he tries to avoid being in his opponent's 
range. The Mobility feat gives him added protection against attacks of 
opportunity, while the Spring Attack feat, combined with his reach 
weapon, allows him to step forward, attack, then retreat again. Due to 
the nature of his weapon, and his strategy, he makes every effort to 
keep the combat in an open area. He prefers to choose the time and place
 of his combat and has no qualms about fleeing so he can live to fight 
another day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Treasure</b></p>
<p class="size2">Determine the weapon master's treasure according to 
your campaign's needs. He has the items listed below in his statistics, 
but otherwise, he could have anything on him that wouldn't encumber him.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Encounter Ideas</b></p>
<p class="size2">Good-aligned characters can take antagonistic roles 
just as effectively as evil-aligned NPCs, sometimes more effectively 
because fighting them can present a moral dilemma to your PCs. It all 
depends on the tale you're telling with your players.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Why a Good Weapon Master Might Attack the PCs</i></p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs purposefully or inadvertently did something that offended 
the weapon master, such as tarnishing the honor of his sister or 
speaking out against his lord.</li>
<li> Someone has spread a false rumor that the PCs committed an offensive act.</li>
<li> The PCs are hired to protect a noblewoman traveling to speak with 
her brother, a friend of the weapon master. The brother has inherited 
some land. Unfortunately, the family's enemies have determined a way to 
eliminate both siblings: The apricot brandy she brings to celebrate with
 her brother is poisoned. The weapon master believes the PCs are 
responsible for their deaths/near-deaths.</li>
<li> The PCs need another fighter (NPC) in the group for a particular 
mission. Before the weapon master will agree to adventure with them, 
they must prove they're skilled by fighting him to his satisfaction.</li>
<li> The PCs come upon a fight in progress and kill this weapon master's
 opponent. Now he must teach them a lesson for humiliating him. He may 
or may not feel the need to kill them.</li>
<li> A parent or sibling of one PC once killed or condemned a family 
member of the weapon master. The weapon master wants to clear the family
 name by killing the offender's relative, the PC.</li>
</ul>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="right" width="200"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="center"><b>Top Ten Reasons an Evil Weapon Master Would Attack the PCs</b></p>
<p class="size2">10. Wrong place, wrong time.</p>
<p class="size2">9. Territorial issues.</p>
<p class="size2">8. The PCs killed, injured, maimed, humiliated, 
insulted, splashed, bumped, touched, talked about, looked at, or ignored
 one of the weapon master's allies or relatives.</p>
<p class="size2">7. The PCs killed, injured, maimed, humiliated, 
insulted, splashed, bumped, touched, talked about, looked at, or ignored
 the weapon master.</p>
<p class="size2">6. The weapon master doesn't like ?the looks of 'em.?</p>
<p class="size2">5. The weapon master hasn't had his coffee. </p>
<p class="size2">4. The PCs breathe too loudly.</p>
<p class="size2">3. They're the PCs.</p>
<p class="size2">2. You've got a whole hour until <i>Buffy</i> comes on.</p>
