(Encounter Level) by adjusting the number of ravagers that attack. The 
table below offers a shortcut for doing so; refer also to page 101 of 
the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11551">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. </i>A lone ravager has a minimum Challenge Rating of 6. </p>

<p class="size2">This table shows the number of ravagers who will 
provide a challenging encounter for a group of at least four PCs, based 
on the group's average level. Other factors in the fight may require you
 to increase or decrease the figures listed below. For example, bump the
 difficulty by one notch for each increment of increase in the average 
ravager level, as demonstrated in the CR 7 column of the table.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Ravager Groups</b></p>
<p class="size2">By the time one sees a band of ravagers, it's too late 
-- they're attacking. They usually carry out their missions in groups of
 three or more, killing, maiming and torturing everyone in sight. 
Ravagers don't travel alone unless they have a darn good reason for it. 
Most people know to stay out of the way of these ruthless killers. Where
 there's one, there are usually several more not far behind. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tactics</b></p>
<p class="size2">Many people say that ravagers attack blindly, like 
rabid animals, without strategy. That myth results from the fact that 
few people have survived ravager attacks. Those who did survive were too
 busy hiding or fighting to realistically assess the ravagers' tactics. 
In truth, while ravagers do display savagery and a definite lack of 
mercy in their attacks, they do not act without control. Just because 
they have no morals doesn't mean they lack intelligence, nor are they 
martyrs. After all, these ex-kidnappers, brigands and serial killers 
have sworn themselves to Erythnul, the Deity of Slaughter.</p>
<p class="size2">Ravagers use different variations of two basic tactics.
 They sometimes penetrate a village like a dagger, driving in and 
killing everything in their path, then retreating back the way they 
came. Or, they cut a path straight through, slaughtering everything they
 meet on the way. They fight even more ferociously when cornered, 
ganging up on the greatest perceived threat. They will aid one another, 
but they will just as quickly abandon one of their own rather than fight
 a losing battle. When it comes right down to it, it's every ravager for
 him- or herself. The ravagers see no shame in retreat, since they're 
the ones causing all the havoc in the first place. They have no purpose 
to their attacks aside from spreading grief, terror and horror.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Treasure</b></p>
<p class="size2">Ravagers don't carry much of value. They don't need it.
 While they're not thieves, per se, they may steal a trinket or two from
 their victims. They do take souvenirs from their most memorable 
victims. Gems and gold, however, don't do much for ravagers. Their 
reputations make it difficult for them to find merchants willing to 
trade their stolen goods. Only the dirtiest black marketers manage to 
overcome their fear of the ravagers. Ravagers much prefer to keep 
objects they can use, such as weapons, magic items, food, and, 
sometimes, ?disposable? slaves.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Encounter Ideas</b></p>
<p class="size2">Player characters can encounter ravagers in numerous situations.</p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs come across a caravan massacred by ravagers. Where are the ravagers?</li>
<li> Ravagers suddenly attack a village where the PCs have stopped to rest.</li>
<li> Ravagers have kidnapped several good clerics and intend to kill 
them after they've served their purpose. A dying witness reports what he
 saw.</li>
<li> A lone ravager comes into town. He intends to assassinate an old 
rival staying there. Other than spooking everyone, the ravager doesn't 
plan to make any trouble. Will the town and the PCs allow him to 
complete his business and move on, or attempt to stop him?</li>
<li> The PCs find a severely wounded ravager. Will they know she's a 
ravager? If not, what will they do later, when they find out? If so, 
will they nurse her back to health? What will the ravager do if they 
show her kindness? Will she betray them later?</li>
<li> The PCs accidentally stumble upon a secret temple to Erythnul 
hidden in the merchant district of a major city. Unfortunately, a cleric
 or ravager sees them, too. Within an hour, they receive threats stating
 they and their families will die if they reveal what they know to 
anyone. Of course, the ravagers can't let them live, even if they agree 
to keep quiet -- can they? What will the PCs do?</li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b>Sample NPCs</b></p>
<p class="size2">Feel free to alter these statistics to suit your own 
campaign. The first block shows complete statistics for a human ravager 
of 6th level, the lowest-level ravager possible. The second block shows 
complete statistics for a human ravager of 7th level, built so the 
ravager gains the second attack and bonus feat of a 6th-level fighter 
before becoming a ravager. The others show additions that accompany a 
level increase, based on the 7th-level ravager.</p>
