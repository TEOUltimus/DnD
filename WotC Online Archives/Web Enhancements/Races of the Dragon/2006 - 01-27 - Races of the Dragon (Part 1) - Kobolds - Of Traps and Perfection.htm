 -- highlighting more features for the kobolds. Kobold traps, originally
 scheduled to appear in this sourcebook, are now offered here to help 
stock your kobold infested (or infused) dungeons. The kobold paragon is a
 new racial paragon class option, designed to make the most out of 
playing a character strictly kobold in nature. For more information on 
racial paragons, refer to pg. 32 of <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>:</p>
<p align="LEFT">"In most <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns, the ideas of class 
and race are separate concepts. But with racial paragon classes, the 
line between the two becomes blurred. Racial paragons are, as their name
 suggests, nearly ideal examples of the strengths and abilities of the 
character's race. Unlike members of other classes, however, racial 
paragons are more than merely powerful individuals. They are strong in 
all the ways that their race is strong, while still vulnerable in the 
ways their race is vulnerable. Beyond that, they possess powers and 
capabilities that supersede those of normal members of their race. While
 any elf might rise in power, prestige, and (in <b>D&amp;D</b> terms) level, most do so by gaining levels in the character classes described in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> -- only a few are so much in tune with their heritage and racial abilities that they become racial paragons."</p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Kobold Traps (CR 1 to CR 10)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2001-27%20-%20Races%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Kobolds%20-%20Of%20Traps%20and%20Perfection_files/dx0127we_rotdwe_trapmaker.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="314" width="262">
 Trapmaking is an obsession for kobolds, who regard their racial craft 
as an art form. Kobolds realized long ago that for every trap installed 
around their lair, another kobold life is spared... or more importantly,
 kept out of melee combat. Consequently, a dedicated and proven 
trapsmith is the closest equivalent that kobolds come to a celebrity in 
their society. For this reason, all kobolds aspire to protect their 
homes with especially devious traps, wanting to be respected as a 
trapsmith on some level. It is not uncommon to find entire kobold 
communities participating in the construction of a particularly 
complicated trap (not unlike a barn raising). Protecting the tribal lair
 from invaders, and gnomes in particular, is the highest priority of 
kobold lairs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Below are ten kobold traps, one for each Challenge 
Rating from 1 to 10. Most of these traps still have default Search 
saves, Disable Device saves, Reflex saves, attack bonuses, and damage 
bonuses (except for the bated fusillade trap). Raising or lowering these
 values is left for individual trapmakers to modify as they see fit (see
 the rules for "Designing a Trap" on page 74 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Two of the mechanical traps (below) incorporate a new miscellaneous feature developed by kobold trapsmiths: tracking.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tracking: </b>Traps with this feature adjust to 
follow a target that activates their trigger and continues to apply its 
effect. Such traps usually incorporate the automatic reset type. Traps 
with the multiple target feature adjust to follow the target area that 
their trigger indicates is the most occupied. Equally occupied target 
areas are chosen at random. This feature adds a +1 CR modifier to 
mechanical traps.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 1: Choke Point Trap</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Kobolds strategically design choke points traps into 
the tunnels of their lairs to slow down pursuers and trap would-be 
invaders in dead-end rooms (where other traps are usually located). If 
you have 5 or more ranks of Knowledge (architecture and engineering) you
 gain a +2 bonus on Disable Device and Search checks with regards to 
this trap.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Choke Point Trap:</b> CR 1 mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; Escape Artist DC 15 (see note); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price:</i> 1,500 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> 5 ft. of tunnel is narrow and low* for 
Medium creatures (2 1/2 ft. high by 2 1/2 ft. wide) but narrow* for 
kobolds. Reverse direction is an awkward space* for Medium creatures 
(Escape Artist DC 15) but narrow and low* for kobolds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">* See page 55 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 2: Automatic Phalanx</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Kobolds design automatic phalanxes into the floors 
and walls of their lairs, set to activate when a creature of 50 pounds 
of more passes over the trigger area. Kobolds will flee from an invading
 enemy and lure them towards these traps. Magical versions of this trap 
might be proximity activated, using a </i>detect good<i> spell to sense targets.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Automatic Phalanx:</b> CR 2; mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; Atk +10 melee (1d8/x3, 1d4 spears); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price:</i> 3,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> Charging or running over location trigger doubles damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 3: Topsy-Turvy Bridge</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Kobolds will sometimes construct a few stable rope 
bridges over existing chasms, hoping to foster a false sense of 
security, and then one topsy-turvy bridge when least expected. These 
5-feet wide bridges flip over when a creature of 50 pounds of more 
passes over the trigger area.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Topsy-Turvy Bridge:</b> CR 3; mechanical; location 
trigger; automatic reset; DC 20 Reflex save avoids; 40-ft. deep (4d6, 
fall); multiple targets (all targets within 10 ft. of target); Search DC
 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price:</i> 4,500 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> Trap activates on the middle 5-ft. square of bridge.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 4: High and Low Trap</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The high and low trap is a perfect example of how 
kobolds try to induce panic in their targets. When a trap deals damage 
on two fronts simultaneously, most targets cannot think calmly enough to
 weigh their options, and run blindly from both dangers instead. High 
and low traps are excellent tools for corralling adventurers in 
particular directions.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>High and Low Trap:</b> CR 4; mechanical; automatic 
reset; proximity trigger; multiple traps (arrow fusillade and fixed 
caltrops); arrow fusillade (Atk +10 ranged [1d6/x3, shortbow arrow]; 
tracking; multiple targets [1d4 arrows at each target in a 
10-ft.-by-10-ft. area]; Search 20; Disable Device DC 20), fixed caltrops
 (special bypass [half Speed]; multiple targets [1 caltrop attack per 
5-ft square]; Search 20; Disable Device 20). <i>Market Price:</i> 10,500 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> Using Dexterity to avoid arrow fusillade prompts caltrop attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 5: Trap Door <i>Locust Swarm</i></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Nothing pleases a kobold more than putting insects 
into a trap from which the target cannot easily escape. For the purposes
 of this trap, </i>locust swarm<i> is considered a 3rd-level spell, based on the 2nd-level </i>summon swarm<i> spell, but summons a locust swarm* instead. As an upgrade, a centipede swarm would be considered a 4th-level spell.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">* See page 239 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trap Door <i>Locust Swarm</i>:</b> CR 5; mechanical and magical device; location trigger; automatic reset; multiple traps (trap door and <i>locust swarm</i>); trap door (DC 20 Reflex save avoids; 20-ft. deep [2d6, fall]; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20), spell effect (<i>locust swarm</i>, 6th level sorcerer; Search DC 28; Disable Device DC 28). <i>Market Price/Cost:</i> 12,000 gp, 720 XP.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> This trap is really a CR 2 pit trap and a CR 4 <i>locust swarm</i>
 trap. These effects are dependant on each other. The trap door swings 
shut after being triggered, creating natural darkness. The locust swarm 
lasts until defeated or the spell effect is disabled.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 6: <i>Hold Person</i> Hidden Catapult</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A<i> favorite among kobolds, </i>hold person<i> hidden 
catapults are sometimes attended by nearby kobolds hoping to watch 
hapless adventurers spring this trap. More dramatic versions of this 
trap are constructed for multiple targets. They activate when a creature
 of 50 pounds of more passes over the trigger area.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Hold Person</i> Hidden Catapult:</b> CR 6; magical and mechanical device; location trigger; automatic reset; multiple traps (<i>hold person</i> and hidden catapult); spell effect (<i>hold person</i>,
 3rd level cleric, DC 13 Will save negates; Search DC 27; Disable Device
 DC 27), hidden catapult (DC 20 Reflex save avoids; target hurled 50-ft 
against stone wall [5d6, bludgeoning] and 50-ft. high [5d6, fall]; 
Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20); <i>Market Price/Cost:</i> 10,500 gp, 240 XP.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> This trap is really a CR 3 <i>hold person</i>
 trap and a CR 5 hidden catapult trap. These effects are complimentary 
to each other. Targets automatically fail the Reflex save if the Will 
save was failed. Subtract 1d6 from bludgeoning damage and 10-ft. from 
fall damage for every extra 200 lbs. of target weight above 200 lbs..</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 7: Collapsing Edge Mining Shaft</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Collapsing edges are installed overlooking chasms, 
pits, and precipices. A collapsing edge above flowing lava is always 
popular. Despite needing regular maintenance, collapsing edges are 
unsuspicious enough to be routinely successful. They are designed to 
activate when creatures of 50 pounds of more pass over the trigger area.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Collapsing Edge Mining Shaft (15 ft. </b>x<b> 15 ft.):</b>
 CR 7; mechanical; location trigger; repair reset; multiple traps (two 
collapsing edge traps); DC 20 Reflex save avoids; 60-ft. deep (6d6, 
fall); sharp rocks (Atk +10 melee, 1d4 sharp rocks per target for 1d4+6 
each); multiple targets (first target in each of three adjacent 5-ft. 
squares); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price:</i> 8,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> This trap is really two CR 5 collapsing 
edge traps that use the same mining shaft. There is one collapsing edge 
trap on the far and near side of the mining shaft. Standing on either 
edge of the shaft activates the trap. Characters who perform a running 
Jump across the mining shaft automatically fail their Reflex save if 
they leap from either edge.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 8: Blown Away Trap</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>A work of art like the blown away trap is usually 
reserved for safeguarding the most coveted locations in a kobold lair, 
like a temple of Kurtulmak where valuable magical treasures are hidden. 
The attack and damage values of the floor spikes will almost certainly 
be upgraded.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blown Away Trap:</b> CR 8; mechanical and magical devices; automatic reset; proximity trigger (<i>alarm</i>); multiple traps (<i>mass reduce person</i>, <i>gust of wind</i>, and extending floor spikes); spell effect (<i>mass</i><i> reduce person</i>,
 8th level sorcerer, DC 16 Fortitude negates; multiple targets [up to 8 
humanoid targets]; Search DC 29; Disable Device DC 29), spell effect (<i>gust of wind</i>,
 4th level sorcerer, DC 13, Fortitude negates; Tiny targets blown back 
1d4 x 10 feet, 1d4 non-lethal damage per 10 feet; multiple targets [12 
squares in a line]; Search DC 27; Disable Device DC 27), extending floor
 spikes (multiple targets [all targets blown prone in 60 ft. line]; Atk 
+10 melee, 1d4 spikes per target for 1d4 each; Search 20; Disable Device
 20). <i>Cost/Market Price:</i> 27,500 gp, 1,600 XP.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> This trap is really a CR 5 <i>mass reduce person</i> trap, a CR 3 <i>gust of wind</i>
 trap, and a CR 6 extending floor spikes trap. These effects are 
dependent on each other. Medium targets reduced to Small size are 
knocked prone by <i>gust of wind</i> onto extending floor spikes. Small 
targets (gnomes in particular) reduced to Tiny size are knocked prone 
onto extending floor spikes and blown 1d4 x 10 feet back, taking 
additional floor spike damage per 5 feet. The <i>gust of wind</i> 
continues blowing until there are no targets in the trigger area, at 
which point the trap resets. The blown away trap works best in narrow 
hallways.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 9: Pinning Water Cage</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Pinning water cages are one of the most callous 
kobold traps. They waste no time with onset delay features, quickly 
immobilizing targets underwater. These cages are usually incorporated 
into subterranean rivers that kobold mining crews redirect from 
underground springs, making them deep enough to fully submerge the cage.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Pinning Water Cage:</b> CR 9; mechanical device; 
proximity trigger; manual reset; metal cage (Atk +10 melee touch), cage 
spears (Atk +10 melee, 1d8/x3, spears); multiple targets (1d4 spears at 
each target within a 10-ft.-by-10-ft. area; targets damaged by spears 
are pinned inside cage and must make a Strength check against DC 10 + 2 
per additional damage-dealing spear to break free); liquid; Search DC 
20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price:</i> 36,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> In addition to being pinned, targets must 
break through cage bars to escape. A DC 24 Strength check is needed to 
bend iron bars.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CR 10: Bated Fusillade Trap </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The bated trap (in this case a fusillade) is a guilty
 pleasure among kobold trapsmiths who enjoy outsmarting rogues rather 
than simply killing them. Bated traps were designed by trapmakers more 
accustomed to dealing with intelligent prey. Generally speaking, the 
poison is the most lethal part of such traps.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bated Fusillade Trap:</b> CR 10; mechanical; touch 
trigger/proximity trigger (disabling activates proximity trigger); 
automatic reset; Atk +10 ranged (1d8/19-20, light crossbow bolt); 
tracking; multiple targets (1d4 bolts at each target in a 
10-ft.-by-10-ft. area); poison (deathblade poison, DC 20, Fortitude save
 resists, 1d6 Con/2d6 Con); Search 10/30; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price:</i> 76,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> A Search check (DC 10) finds the trap. A 
successful Disable Device check triggers the trap. A Search check (DC 
30) of the trap reveals its true nature which can then be disabled.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bonus Kobold Trap</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Races of the Dragon</i> introduced a new 
kobold-created alchemical device called a ditherbomb, which is made in 
three intensities; weak, strong, and wyrm. Adding ditherbombs to a trap

<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2001-27%20-%20Races%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Kobolds%20-%20Of%20Traps%20and%20Perfection_files/dx0127we_rotdwe_kobold.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="314" width="262">Kobolds
 are reptilian humanoids that embrace hard work as the inescapable 
standard of their daily lives. They exist to facilitate the mining 
operations that inevitably sustain their lair without devoting a thought
 to personal ambition or desire. Workers that challenge this 
time-honored fate rebel by excelling in all aspects of kobold life 
rather than simply specializing in one profession. These are the kobold 
paragons of a tribe, willfully motivated athletes of productivity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventures:</b> Kobold paragons are not unlike 
dragons in their pursuit of treasure. Kobold paragons are a little more 
discerning, however, in that they value singular items of power more 
than hordes of gold. They will even travel farther away from their lair 
than most other kobolds, seeking magical jewelry above all else. As 
natural sorcerers, kobold paragons are more than equipped to handle 
monstrous encounters, shoring up their physical weaknesses with arcane 
might.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Characteristics:</b> Kobold paragons are equal part 
creative intuition and strategic warrior. When kobold paragons spearhead
 a plan, they do so with remarkable forethought, whether designing a 
trap, laying out a mine, or looking for the weaknesses of a hated 
opponent. When there is no time to prepare for a fight, kobold paragons 
will maneuver themselves into a narrow space and unleash their ferocity 
on larger opponents without backing down.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alignment:</b> Kobold paragons constantly wrestle 
with their tribal instincts of loyalty in order to more clearly make 
decisions as individuals (a concept largely foreign to kobold culture). 
As such, while kobolds are normally lawful evil, kobold paragons are not
 bound by this cultural disposition. Still, despite their best efforts 
at morality, even good-aligned kobold paragons cannot stop themselves 
from devising painfully sadistic traps in their spare time.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Religion:</b> Kobold paragons generally rationalize 
their actions in the name of Kurtulmak, who suffered greatly at the 
hands of Garl Glittergold, or embrace Io, who follows a more open-minded
 and less racially charged path. With Kurtulmak, kobold paragons are 
polarized against every other race. With Io, kobolds seek objectivity as
 an ideal, allowing them to socialize more with other races. A kobold 
paragon can also express their piety through devoted service to their 
lair.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background:</b> A kobold paragon attains their 
position by excelling in every field of kobold expertise. Where most 
lair-bound kobolds are directed into one profession, kobold paragons 
must become equally skilled at sorcery, trapfinding, and trapmaking. 
This kind of behavior is usually discouraged, as tribal leaders prefer 
the kobolds of their lair to be obedient, specialized workers. A kobold 
paragon must therefore work four times as hard to attain their 
distinction.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Races:</b> Kobolds despise gnomes, distrust dwarves 
and fey, and generally hold every other race in contempt. Kobold 
paragons are different in that they can suspend their racial antipathy 
to gather information about enemies, rather than automatically attacking
 their foes. Feeling isolated in the world, kobolds are outwardly 
defensive towards other creatures. These feelings can diminish as kobold
 paragons spend more time with other humanoids.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Other Classes:</b> Kobold paragons relate to rogues 
and sorcerers more readily than any other classes, as they share the 
most in common with their trapmaking and spellcasting abilities. Kobold 
paragons tend to be more alert and productive around clerics, being 
accustomed to such figures in positions of authority. Kobold paragons 
regard the melee classes with due respect because they usually lack the 
strength to become effective fighters.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Game Rule Information</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Kobold paragons have the following game statistics.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Abilities:</b> Charisma determines the effectiveness 
of a kobold paragon's spellcasting ability and is useful when attempting
 deceptions and collecting information. Dexterity is always an asset to 
kobold paragons, increasing their accuracy when making ranged attacks 
and aiding them in melee combat (after taking the Weapon Finesse feat). 
Constitution makes kobold paragons better able to withstand the physical
 dangers of adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alignment:</b> Any, although predominantly lawful and evil.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hit Die:</b> d6.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Skills</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The kobold paragon's class skills (and the key ability 
for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft
 (Int), Disable Device (Dex), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather Information 
(Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge 
(dungeoneering) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession

<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The following are class features of the kobold paragon class.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> The kobold paragon 
is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the heavy pick and light 
pick. Kobold paragons are also proficient with light armor. Kobold 
paragons treat the dire pick (1) as a martial weapon that can be wielded
 two-handed as a simple weapon and may treat greatpicks (see <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060420a">Kobolds: Playing to Their Strengths</a>) as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spells per Day:</b> At 2nd and 3rd-level, a kobold 
paragon gains new spells per day and spells known as if the character 
had also gained a level in sorcerer. The kobold paragon does not, 
however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have 
gained (familiar abilities, and so on). This essentially means that the 
character adds the level of kobold paragon to their level in sorcerer, 
then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level 
accordingly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a kobold paragon has no levels in sorcerer, this class feature has no effect.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Manual Expertise (Ex):</b> A kobold paragon may add their class level as a racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Profession (mining), and Search checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tunnel Defense (Ex):</b> At 1st level, a kobold 
paragon uses confined spaces to their advantage in melee combat. A 
kobold paragon is treated as a Medium opponent when using or resisting 
any special attack (for example, bull rush, disarm, grapple) but only 
when fighting in a location no wider than their combat space (5-ft. 
wide). In addition, a kobold paragon retains their Dexterity bonus to AC
 even if caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker in these 
confined conditions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> If a kobold paragon has uncanny dodge from a different 
class, the character automatically gains the benefits of improved 
uncanny dodge, but only when fighting in confined conditions (as above).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Darkvision (Ex):</b> At 2nd level, a kobold paragon’s darkvision range increases by 30 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>No Light Sensitivity:</b> At 2nd level, a kobold paragon loses their race's light sensitivity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ability Boost (Ex):</b> At 3rd level, a kobold paragon's Charisma score increases by 2 points.</p>
