 -- which presented new kobold traps plus the optional kobold paragon. 
In this enhancement, we look to expand on the kobolds' repertoire, 
including variant racial traits along with new weapons, rituals, and 
feats!</p>
<p align="left"> One of the most important factors when creating 
additional material for kobolds is that the charm of these reptilian 
humanoids is not their physical power, but their unmistakable lack of 
it. Kobolds should be in no danger of losing the weaknesses that define 
their race; rather than shoring up their infirmities, however, what we 
can do is play to their strengths.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Where they come up short: </b>In a game where NPC 
Challenge Ratings are calculated at class level -1, NPC Challenge 
Ratings for kobolds are calculated at class level -3. Looking at the 
math, it's easy to assume that PC kobolds are underpowered as well. With
 a total Strength and Constitution penalty of -6 against a Dexterity 
bonus of +2, perceived game imbalances are readily pointed out. While 
kobolds enjoy a +1 natural armor bonus, that really only offsets 2 
points worth of ability score penalties, leaving a -2 deficit. 
Maneuverability plays a big role in combat, wherein kobolds are faster 
than most other creatures their size (having a speed of 30 feet), but 
they also suffer from light sensitivity, knocking them down again.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2004-20%20-%20Races%20of%20the%20Dragon%20-%20Kobolds%20%28Part%202%29%20-%20Playing%20to%20Their%20Strengths_files/dx0421we_racesdragon_kobold.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="273" width="200"><b>Why coming up short is a good thing ... for kobolds: </b>For
 some reason, people almost willfully take up the role of kobolds 
despite their weaknesses, citing that the challenge of playing a 
physically weak race can be more rewarding than a powerhouse character. 
Time and again, these PC kobolds not only defy their shortcomings, but 
rise above them, enduring in memory and level long after most characters
 have been forgotten (or destroyed). It's hard not to root for the 
underdog, whether playing or watching one, as people are naturally moved
 by an unlikely hero railing against dismaying odds ... especially when 
the odds should be too daunting for them to overcome. The moment kobolds
 lose the qualities that make their life expectancy dubious at best is 
the moment we stop fighting for their survival.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Races of the Dragon</i> introduced Craft (trapmaking)
 as a class skill for all kobolds. While this really only impacted NPCs 
and prestige class levels, it does help define the outlook of all 
kobolds. Below are some variant racial traits, followed by additional 
game material for any campaign setting. This material was designed to 
shore up the plight of kobolds, but without exceeding their Level 
Adjustment of +0 (or perhaps simply attain that rating).</p>
<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Variant Kobold Racial Traits</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Natural Weapons:</b> Kobolds have two primary claw attacks that 
deal 1d3 points of slashing damage plus Strength bonus, and a secondary 
bite attack that deals 1d3 points of piercing damage plus 1/2 Strength 
bonus. Despite possibly being the weakest reptilian humanoid, kobolds 
retain a connection to their feral nature. </li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E8E8E8" border="0" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><b>Design Notes</b></p>
<p align="left">While this article does not come out and say that 1st 
level kobold characters (applying the core classes) are more accurately 
CR 1/2 creatures, the evidence presents itself. Despite how powerful 
natural weapons may seem in the hands of most characters, this ability 
does not hold up to aggressive min-maxing with kobold PCs.</p>
<p align="left">For example, an elite array kobold fighter will have 11 
Strength and, if lucky enough to hit with each one of these natural 
weapons, will deal an average of 4 points of damage (1.5 x 3 = 4.5 
rounded down). The kobold fighter would be better off attacking with a 
Small greataxe or Small greatsword, both of which enjoy superior 
critical ratings. Adding a claw/claw/bite attack routine doesn't push 
them out of the CR +0 category.</p>
<p align="left">Moreover, giving kobolds natural weapons completes their
 reptilian humanoid heritage, as virtually every other reptilian 
humanoid, Small and Large, have a claw/claw/bite attack routine. 
Lizardfolk (standard, blackscale, and poison dusk), and the troglodyte 
all have these natural weapons.</p>
<p align="left">Looking at the poison dusk lizardfolk in particular, the
 closest approximation to kobolds, they are a +1 Level Adjustment race, 
and rightly so. Poison dusk lizardfolk enjoy +2 Dexterity, +2 
Constitution, -2 Charisma, and +3 natural armor. No Strength penalty for
 being Small, no light sensitivity, 30 feet of movement (again, despite 
being Small), and a +5 Hide bonus for their chameleon ability (on top of
 their size bonus). The kobold is in no danger of stepping on their 
feet, even with a variant natural weapons ability.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li><b>Slight Build:</b> The physical stature of kobolds lets them 
function in many ways as if they were one size category smaller. 
Whenever a kobold is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier
 for an opposed check (such as Hide), the kobold is treated as one size 
smaller if doing so is advantageous to the character. A kobold is also 
considered to be one size smaller when "squeezing" through a restrictive
 space. A kobold can use weapons designed for a creature one size 
smaller without penalty. However, the space and reach of a kobold remain
 those of a creature of their actual size. The benefits of this racial 
trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that 
change the subject's size category.</li><br><br><li><b>Weapon Proficiency: </b>Kobolds
 receive the Martial Weapon Proficiency feats for the heavy pick and 
light pick as bonus feats. Kobolds are born and bred miners, regardless 
of their actual profession, allowing them to easily wield these weapons.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Weapon Familiarity:</b> Kobolds may treat greatpicks (see below) as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Kobold Weapons</b></p>
<p align="left">Leave it to kobolds to get the most from any weapon. If 
there's a slight advantage to be gained from a tool, whether mining or 
attacking from great distances, kobolds will exploit that improvement. </p>

 -4 penalty on attack rolls, but taking Exotic Weapon Proficiency 
(double crossbow) makes a character proficient in the use of all double 
crossbows. The penalty for wielding a hand crossbow without proficiency 
is cumulative with the penalty for wielding a double crossbow without 
proficiency.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weapon Descriptions</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Double Crossbow, Hand:</b> A hand double crossbow 
functions like a regular crossbow of the same type, but is constructed 
with a second crossbow above the foregrip. Individually loading each 
hand crossbow takes a move action that provokes an attack of 
opportunity. It takes a full-round action to load both hand crossbows.</p>
<p align="left">A character can fire one of the two crossbows as an 
exotic weapon (hand crossbow) with a standard action, or both crossbows 
as an exotic weapon (hand crossbow) with a full round action (using 
multiple attacks gained from a high base attack bonus). A character with
 exotic weapon (double crossbow) training can fire both crossbows as a 
full-round action using their highest base attack bonus, but each attack
 takes a -2 penalty.</p>
<p align="left">You can shoot a hand double crossbow with each hand, but
 you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light 
weapons (see Table 8-10: Two Weapon Fighting Penalties, page 160 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Double Crossbow, Heavy:</b> A heavy double crossbow 
functions like a regular crossbow of the same type, but is constructed 
with a second crossbow above the foregrip. Individually loading each 
heavy crossbow takes a full-round action that provokes an attack of 
opportunity. It takes two full-round actions to load both heavy 
crossbows.</p>
<p align="left">A character can fire one of the two crossbows as a 
simple weapon with a standard action, or both crossbows as a simple 
weapon with a full round action (using multiple attacks gained from a 
high base attack bonus). A character with exotic weapon (double 
crossbow) training can fire both crossbows as a full-round action using 
their highest base attack bonus, but each attack takes a -2 penalty.</p>
<p align="left">A heavy double crossbow can be fired with one hand, but 
with a -6 penalty. You can shoot a heavy double crossbow with each hand,
 but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two 
one-handed weapons (see Table 8-10: Two Weapon Fighting Penalties, page 
160 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Double Crossbow, Light:</b> A light double crossbow 
functions like a regular crossbow of the same type, but is constructed 
with a second crossbow above the foregrip. Individually loading each 
light crossbow takes a move action that provokes an attack of 
opportunity. It takes a full-round action to load both light crossbows.</p>
<p align="left">A character can fire one of the two crossbows as a 
simple weapon with a standard action, or both crossbows as a simple 
weapon with a full round action (using multiple attacks gained from a 
high base attack bonus). A character with exotic weapon (double 
crossbow) training can fire both crossbows as a full-round action using 
their highest base attack bonus, but each attack takes a -2 penalty.</p>
<p align="left">A light double crossbow can be fired with one hand, but 
with a -4 penalty. You can shoot a light double crossbow with each hand,
 but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light 
weapons (see Table 8-10: Two Weapon Fighting Penalties, page 160 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Design Notes</b><br>Taking the Exotic Weapon 
Proficiency (double crossbow) grants no more attacks with a double 
crossbow than firing a double crossbow twice with a high base attack 
bonus. The difference is that with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency, both 
attacks are at your highest base attack bonus, but with a -2 penalty; 
whereas using the second attack from a high base attack bonus comes with
 a -5 penalty. For example, a 6th level fighter with Exotic Weapon 
Proficiency (double crossbow) attacks with a +4/+4, while a 6th level 
fighter (without with the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat) can attack 
with a +6/+1 base attack bonus. The advantage of taking Exotic Weapon 
Proficiency (double crossbow) is there, and just powerful enough to 
justify the feat. Taking the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat for double 
crossbows essentially offers a benefit identical to the Rapid Shot feat.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Granted Power:</b> You can use the Search skill to 
locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. You 
can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A cleric with 
the Kobold domain who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable 
Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it 
(with their party) without disarming it.</p>

 is a ritual that grants any kobold who completes the rite a 1st-level 
sorcerer spell-like ability of their choice, usable once per day. To 
recharge this ability, a kobold must complete the Searching for the 
Dragon meditation each day, which equates to same amount of time a 
sorcerer must spend concentrating to replenish their spells. The 
following ritual (and associated feat) are extensions of the Draconic 
Rite of Passage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Greater Draconic Rite of Passage</b></p>
<p align="left">The Greater Draconic Rite of Passage is a powerful 
ritual handed down from dragons to kobolds as a reward for their undying
 loyalty. In the same way that chromatic and metallic dragons gain 
integrated levels of sorcerer spellcasting as they age, this ritual 
allows kobolds to awaken a small amount of their own arcane might.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Only kobolds of 6 Hit Dice or 
more, sorcerer level 1st, who have successfully completed the Draconic 
Rite of Passage, and taken Draconic Reservoir (1) can undergo the 
Greater Draconic Rite of Passage. A kobold requires no one else to 
perform the rite; it is a solitary activity.</p>
<p align="left"> (1) See below for feat description.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> Upon completing this rite, a kobold 
gains new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells 
known) as if also gaining one level in the sorcerer class. The kobold 
does not, however, gain any other benefit a sorcerer would have gained 
(familiar abilities, and so on).</p>
<p align="left">The benefit of this ritual is automatically factored 
into the 15 minutes that a kobold sorcerer spends concentrating to ready
 their daily allotment of spells. No kobold can benefit from this rite 
more than once.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Time:</b> A kobold who undergoes this rite must first
 endure nine days of fasting (the equivalent of three days for a kobold 
in a region above 40 degrees F). Immediately thereafter, the kobold must
 succeed on a DC 20 Concentration check to enter a deep trance that 
lasts for 24 hours. If the check fails, the rite must begin a new.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cost:</b> This rite requires sacrificing a gem of at 
least 1,000 gp in value. The kobold also permanently loses 3 hit points 
upon completion of the rite, the price of unlocking latent draconic 
energy within their soul.</p>
<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Kobold Feat</b></p>
<p align="left">This feat lets kobolds increase the number of daily 
castings for their Draconic Rite of Passage spell-like ability (see page
 43 of Races of the Dragon). It is also a prerequisite for the Greater 
Draconic Rite of Passage (see above for description).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Draconic Reservoir</b></p>
<p align="left">You can cast your Draconic Rite of Passage spell-like ability more often than normal.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Kobold, must have completed the Draconic Rite of Passage, 3 HD.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> You can cast your 1st-level sorcerer 
spell-like ability gained from Draconic Rite of Passage 3/day. A kobold 
must complete the Searching for the Dragon meditation in order to 
recharge their spell-like ability, but does not have to increase the 15 
minute duration for the additional castings.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Normal:</b> The spell-like ability gained from Draconic Rite of Passage can only be cast 1/day.</p><br><p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2004-20%20-%20Races%20of%20the%20Dragon%20-%20Kobolds%20%28Part%202%29%20-%20Playing%20to%20Their%20Strengths_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
