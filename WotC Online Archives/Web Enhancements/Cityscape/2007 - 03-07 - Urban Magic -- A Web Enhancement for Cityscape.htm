 presents a variety of new feats, spells, and warlock invocations that 
were developed in an urban environment or that you can use in a 
city-based setting. While these are the most prevalent of new tools and 
tricks for the urban adventurer, however, they are far from the only 
ones. Other, stranger wielders of magic, from the mysterious 
shadowcaster to the heretical binders, draw on powers and entities of a 
particularly urban bent. For those who do not practice such esoteric 
arts, not only magic items, but also alchemical and entirely mundane 
tools, exist to enhance the abilities of the city explorer.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Several of the abilities and items herein reference mechanics from <i>Cityscape</i>. Both the shadowcaster and the binder can be found in the <i>Tome of Magic</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spirits of the City</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Binders do not work their own magics, but instead call 
upon and bond with vestiges, strange spiritual beings from beyond the 
known multiverse. While none of these vestiges are entirely unique to 
large communities, several have both histories and abilities that lend 
themselves toward urban adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Astaroth, Unjustly Fallen</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A fallen angel who would never accept responsibility for
 his own transgressions, Astaroth grants his summoners influence over 
the behavior of others, knowledge of hidden things, and the ability to 
sicken enemies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2007%20-%2003-07%20-%20Urban%20Magic%20--%20A%20Web%20Enhancement%20for%20Cityscape_files/dx20070307_cityscape_astaroth.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="291" width="225">Astaroth<br></b>Vestige Level: 4th<br> Binding DC: 22<br> Special Requirement: No</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Legend:</b> Scholars know little of Astaroth before 
his fall, save that he favored constant interference and assistance when
 it came to mortals, rather than leaving them to develop on their own. 
Some tales claim that he was responsible for teaching humanoids such 
techniques as metalworking and even alchemy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">According to ancient writings, Astaroth himself 
maintains that this was why he fell, cast from Heaven for the "crime" of
 aiding the mortal races in their development of civilization. Most 
theologians, however, remain convinced that the angel was exiled for 
greater crimes. Legends range from an attempt to usurp the position of 
some heavenly god, to an effort to raise an entire mortal race to 
celestial status, to an attempt to turn all mortals away from worship of
 the gods so that he might be free to influence them as he saw fit. 
Astaroth admitted to no such defiance, however, and swore to the day of 
his disappearance that his fall was unjust.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For centuries Astaroth roamed many worlds, mortal and 
spiritual alike. To the celestials, he was an outcast -- another 
prideful fallen angel who could not even admit to his errors, let alone 
atone for them. Yet because he refused to embrace damnation, he found no
 allies among the fiends either. Eventually he settled among mortals. He
 watched over them as a guardian and mentor to start, but slowly his 
obsession with "protecting" the mortals grew uncontrollable. Astaroth 
became a dictator, restricting even the day-to-day behavior of his 
subjects to keep them "safe." The fallen angel was finally slain by an 
uprising within the populace, but none of the Outer Planes would grant 
his soul any respite. Eventually, with no afterlife to call his own, 
stripped even of his physical existence, Astaroth simply went -- 
elsewhere.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Manifestation:</b> Accompanied by the sound of 
flapping wings and cawing crows, Astaroth manifests as a hideously ugly 
angel. His limp wings are filthy gray, his features drawn and gaunt, and
 his eyes yellowed. He carries a viper in his right hand and wears a 
tarnished crown upon his brow. A horrific stench accompanies him, almost
 but not quite enough to sicken everyone nearby.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sign:</b> Your skin yellows, and you emit a foul, 
unwashed odor. While this odor is not strong enough to impede or 
distract an opponent, it does attract attention.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Influence:</b> Astaroth's influence renders you 
incapable of taking responsibility for your own actions. You cannot 
admit any fault, acknowledge any mistake, or make reparations or 
apologies for any wrong, no matter the consequences or the evidence 
against you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Granted Abilities:</b> Astaroth guided mortals, and 
he still grants abilities based in knowledge and education. As a fallen 
angel, and then a vestige, his magics have grown ever grimmer and more 
distasteful; he also grants powers based on directly controlling and 
offending others.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Angelic Lore:</i> Astaroth constantly whispers the 
secrets of reality in the back of your mind, allowing you to draw on his
 own nigh-infinite knowledge. This functions as the bardic knowledge 
ability (<i>PH </i>28), based on your effective binder level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Astaroth's Breath:</i> Once every 5 rounds, you can 
exhale a 60-foot cone of foul-smelling gas. Creatures within the cone 
must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 
an additional 1d4 rounds. Those who make the save are merely sickened 
for 1 round. Creatures immune to poison or disease are immune to this 
effect.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Honeyed Tongue:</i> You gain a +4 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Master Craftsman:</i> While bound to Astaroth, you 
gain a +4 competence bonus on all Craft checks. In addition, each time 
you bind with Astaroth, you may select one item creation feat as a 
temporary bonus feat. So long as you continue to bind with Astaroth, you
 may use that feat as though you possessed it normally; you must still 
spend all standard gold and XP for any item you create, and you must 
still provide all necessary spells for a given item.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If your effective binder level is not at least as high 
as the necessary caster level to take a specific item creation feat, you
 cannot choose that feat. For instance, a 4th-level binder could not 
choose any item creation feat with a prerequisite of caster level 5th or
 higher.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Word of Astaroth:</i> You may make a <i>suggestion</i>, as the spell, with a caster level equal to your effective binder level. You must wait 5 rounds before attempting another <i>suggestion</i>,
 and at any given time, you may only have a total number of people under
 the effects of this ability equal to your Charisma bonus.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Desharis, the Sprawling Soul</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The first of the "city-born fey," represented today by such creatures as the zeitgeist (<i>Cityscape</i> 138) and the gray jester (<i>Heroes of Horror </i>151),
 Desharis is a boon to those who work to spread civilization, and 
anathema to most fey and worshipers of the wild. He grants binders 
shelter against the dangers of the wild, and he provides powers to carve
 out their own niche against nature.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2007%20-%2003-07%20-%20Urban%20Magic%20--%20A%20Web%20Enhancement%20for%20Cityscape_files/dx20070307_cityscape_desharis.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="291" width="225">Desharis<br></b>Vestige Level: 6th<br> Binding DC: 27<br> Special Requirement: Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Legend:</b> According to ancient myths, the earliest 
true community was a human village called Desh, or "shelter" in the old 
tongue. Here the people dwelt together for protection against predators,
 and they first constructed structures rather than use existing shelters
 for protection against the elements. (For more on the legend of Desh, 
see <i>Races of Destiny</i>.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">This legend itself is neither uncommon nor unknown 
today. What few realize, however, is how swiftly the natural and magical
 worlds adapt to changes within. Desh was not merely the first 
community, but it also birthed the first urban fey, a distant ancestor 
of what would become the mighty zeitgeist.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Desharis knew nothing of his own origins. He knew only 
that of his two conflicting urges -- one to protect the sanctity of the 
natural world, the other to defend Desh and the people therein -- the 
latter was by far the stronger. Invisibly, he worked to stave off 
attacks from predators; to keep the village free of plague; and to aid 
its inhabitants when other humanoids attempted to raid Desh for its 
supplies. While the people of Desh thanked the gods and spirits for 
their fortune, however, they never knew of Desharis himself. The other 
fey of the world, horrified at the notion of a spreading society that 
might supplant the natural order, counted Desharis a traitor. They 
worked to thwart his efforts and even destroy him. Though he was, in 
effect, the very embodiment of community, Desharis was ever alone.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Desharis grew bitter at the disdain of the other fey, 
and some suggest that he inspired the spread of civilization as 
vengeance against them. Whatever the case, Desharis spread as the notion
 of community did, growing ever more diffuse, ever larger. Though he 
gained in size and influence, he gained nothing in the way of power; 
smaller villages added nothing to his abilities, and larger communities 
frequently birthed their own urban fey. Eventually, the spirit of 
community was too diffuse and spread out to exist as a being at all -- 
and yet, as the embodiment of civilization, now a permanent part of the 
world, he could not entirely fade away.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Requirement:</b> If you have gone more than a
 day without binding Desharis, you may only draw his seal in a village 
or larger city. Attempts to do so elsewhere fail outright. You can, 
however, "carry" Desharis into the wild; this is why you may continue to
 summon him, even outside the urban environment, if you have not allowed
 more than a day to lapse since you last did so.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Manifestation:</b> Desharis appears with the sound of
 a hundred distant voices talking and shouting, though specific words 
remain completely unintelligible. A veritable mob of individuals appears
 as from a great distance, as though the air above his seal had become a
 window to some other place. As the mob approaches, these bare 
silhouettes meld together even as they take on greater details, 
eventually combining to form a single humanoid shape standing 10 feet in
 height. Though the silhouettes look human, Desharis himself appears 
made of equal amounts of stone, wood, metal, and glass.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sign:</b> While hosting Desharis, your eyes turn to 
glass. Anyone meeting your gaze sees the movement of multiple 
silhouettes behind them, as though looking through a window at a busy 
street.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Influence:</b> Under Desharis's influence, you cannot
 stand to be alone, and the more people you have around you, the better.
 You never voluntarily accept any task that requires you to be alone, 
and you argue vigorously against options that would split the party. If 
you have the opportunity to socialize with large groups of people (such 
as entering a boisterous tavern), you must take it unless doing so is 
overtly harmful, or you have reason to suspect the individuals are 
hostile to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Granted Abilities:</b> Desharis grants abilities that
 reflect his desire to protect the civilized peoples of the world, plus 
provides a few that show his anger at the fey and other creatures of 
nature.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>City-Dweller:</i> While hosting Desharis, you move at
 your normal rate when moving through a crowd, rather than requiring two
 squares of movement for every square as is normal. In addition, you 
gain a +6 competence bonus on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) 
checks (and may use the latter even if you have 0 ranks in it).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Infinite Doors:</i> Once per day, you can pass 
through an exterior doorway (one that leads from inside a building to 
outside), and appear through another exterior doorway within 3,000 
yards. The two doors must both be set in buildings made of similar 
materials; for instance, you could pass from a wooden building to 
another wooden building, or a stone building to another stone building. 
You can either select a specific door with which you are familiar as the
 destination, or simply declare that you are appearing through the 
closest appropriate door to a given distance. (If no appropriate portal 
exists within range or in the direction you wish to travel, the effect 
does not function.) This is a teleportation effect.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Language of the City:</i> You can speak with any humanoid, as per the <i>tongues</i> spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Smite Natural Soul:</i> You may attempt to smite an 
animal, elemental, fey, or plant with a single melee attack. You add 
your Charisma bonus (if any) to the attack roll and deal 1 extra point 
of damage per effective binder level. If you accidentally smite a 
creature that is not one of the above types, the attempt has no effect. 
Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Spirits of the City:</i> You can <i>animate objects</i>,
 as the spell, as a caster of your binder level. Once you have used this
 ability, you must wait 5 rounds after the effect has expired, or all 
the objects have been destroyed, before you may do so again.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shadows of the City</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-07%20-%20Urban%20Magic%20--%20A%20Web%20Enhancement%20for%20Cityscape_files/dx20070307_cityscape_shadowcaster.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="262" width="240">Binders
 are not the only practitioners of strange magics operating in the 
bustling city. The night-touched shadowcaster draws her power from the 
Plane of Shadow, and the dark and twisted reflection of the material 
world cast therein. And nothing, an urban shadowcaster would tell you, 
casts a longer or darker shadow than tall buildings and endless winding 
streets.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Apprentice Path Mysteries</b></p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>The air blackens, the shadows of the alleys lengthen, and the wind shrieks as the Shadow and Material Planes collide.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Black labyrinth</i> causes substantial disorientation
 within the area it affects. Direction and distance become impossible to
 determine, as the world itself bends and twists.</p>
<ul>
<li> All attacks have a 50% miss chance.<br><br></li>
<li>Area effects with a source or target within the <i>black labyrinth</i>
 have a 20% chance of improper placement. If this occurs, the spell is 
centered 1d4 x 5 feet in a random direction from where the caster 
intended. To determine direction, use the rules for a missed splash 
weapon (<i>PH</i> 158).<br><br></li>
<li>All Search and Spot checks take a -10 penalty.<br><br></li>
<li>Any movement, from a 5-foot step to a full run and everything 
between, occurs in a random direction. (Again, use the rules for a 
missed splash weapon to determine direction.) Reroll any result that 
places the creature in an "illegal" space (in another creature's area, 
within a wall, and so on). A random roll that results in a fall off a 
ledge (or a similar mishap) <i>is </i>allowable. A successful Will save negates this particular effect, but that save must be repeated for each round of movement.<br><br></li>
<li> Any teleportation effects with a destination inside the <i>black labyrinth</i>
 deposit their passengers 1d% x 5 feet from the intended destination. If
 this would put them inside a solid object, treat as a mishap as 
described in the <i>teleport</i> spell. If this would send them outside the mystery's area, roll again. A teleport effect cast within the <i>black labyrinth</i>
 and intended to transport the subject to a point outside the affected 
area requires a successful Will save; failure indicates that the subject
 instead teleports to a random point within the <i>black</i><i>labyrinth</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">When within your own <i>black labyrinth</i>, you are 
immune to the last two effects (movement and teleportation), but not the
 others. You may attempt to guide your companions through the <i>labyrinth</i>;
 this does not allow them to find their way automatically, but it does 
grant them a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist those two effects.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The area of <i>deadly shade</i> is filled with shadowy illumination, as per <i>darkness </i>(<i>PH</i> 216). In addition, each time you invoke this mystery, decide if you wish the spell to deal or absorb damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you choose to deal damage, anyone within the area who
 suffers hit point damage from any source must make a Fortitude save. 
Failure indicates that the subject gains a negative level. Success 
prevents the negative level, but if the individual is damaged again 
within the area, he must attempt a new save. These negative levels fade 
in 1 hour per caster level, and they never cause permanent level loss.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you choose instead to have the <i>deadly shade</i> 
absorb damage, all creatures within the area gain DR 4/-- and energy 
resistance 4 against all energy types. (This stacks with other forms of 
resistance or other sources that grant DR X/--.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fearful Gloom<br></b>Initiate, Darkened Alleys<br><b>Level/School:</b> 4th/Necromancy [Darkness, Fear, Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Area: </b>30-ft.-radius emanation<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial; see text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Plumes of blackness swiftly fill the air like a 
viscous fog. The shifting of shadow and mists just barely suggests the 
presence of screaming faces and indescribable horrors lurking in the 
dark.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The area of <i>fearful gloom</i> is filled with shadowy illumination, as per <i>darkness </i>(<i>PH</i>
 216). All creatures within the area, or who enter it, must attempt a 
Will save or become frightened; on a successful save, they are shaken 
instead. If the creature has fewer than 5 HD, it is panicked on a failed
 save and frightened on a success. Creatures within the area must repeat
 the save each round until they either fail or leave the area. Once a 
creature has left the <i>fearful gloom</i>, the effects last an additional 2d6 rounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Grasping Shadows<br></b>Master, Shadowscape<br><b>Level/School: </b>7th/Conjuration (Creation)<br><b>Range: </b>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area/Target: </b>20-ft.-radius spread<br><b>Duration: </b>1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> See text</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Stalks of shadows burst from the ground, as though 
desperate to escape the bonds of the earth, and immediately flail at 
everyone nearby.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">This mystery creates an area of grasping tendrils that function as the spell <i>Evard's black tentacles </i>(<i>PH </i>228),
 with one additional hazard: Anyone successfully grappled by a tentacle 
must attempt a Will save or go blind. A successful save means the 
individual is safe from blinding during that particular grapple, but if 
she escapes and is then regrappled, she must make another saving throw. 
The blindness is permanent until magically cured.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Menagerie of Darkness<br></b>Master, Shadowscape<br><b>Level/School: </b>8th/Transmutation<br><b>Range: </b>30 ft.<br><b>Area: </b>30-ft.-radius emanation centered on you<br><b>Duration: </b>10 minutes/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Nearby animals and vermin abruptly shudder. Their 
mouths and eyes gape wide as a torrent of blackness flows into them from
 the surrounding gloom.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Any animals or vermin within the emanation, or who enter
 it, must make a Will save or immediately take on the aspects of their 
shadow selves, temporarily gaining the dark creature template (<i>Tome of Magic </i>158). You gain control over these animals, as per the spell <i>dominate animal </i>(<i>PH</i>
 224). You can command any number of them as a single move action if you
 are giving them all the same orders. If you wish to give different 
commands to different animals or vermin, however, you must spend a move 
action on <i>each</i> order.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At any given time, you may have a total number of Hit 
Dice of animals and vermin under your control equal to 4 x your caster 
level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Menagerie of darkness</i> does not affect animals or vermin with Hit Dice higher than your caster level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Quicker than the Eye<br></b>Apprentice, Night's Long Fingers<br><b>Level/School:</b> 1st/Transmutation<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target: </b>You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute/level (D)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>A faint layer of shadow flows like ink over your 
hands, staining them pitch black -- and then, in an instant, they appear
 normal once more.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">You gain a +5 enhancement bonus on Sleight of Hand 
checks (which you can now attempt even if you have no ranks in that 
skill). This bonus increases to +10 at 5th level, and +15 at 10th level.
 In addition, if you invoke <i>umbral hand </i>(<i>Tome of Magic </i>152), you may attempt Sleight of Hand checks through it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sickening Shadow<br></b>Initiate, Darkened Alleys<br><b>Level/School:</b> 5th/Necromancy [Darkness]<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Area: </b>30-ft.-radius emanation<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial; see text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>An oily black smoke rolls out of nowhere, obscuring 
sight and sound. It leaves a distasteful residue on everything within, 
and the scent is one of open sewers and putrefied flesh.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The area of <i>sickening shadow</i> is filled with shadowy illumination, as per <i>darkness </i>(<i>PH</i>
 216). All creatures within the area, or those who enter it, must 
attempt a Fortitude save or be nauseated. Those who succeed are merely 
sickened. Creatures within the area must repeat the save each round 
until they either fail or leave the area. Once a creature has left the <i>sickening shadow</i>,
 the sickened effect lasts for 2d6 rounds. Nausea lasts for 1d4 rounds 
and is then followed by an additional 2d6 rounds of being sickened.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trail of Haze<br></b>Apprentice, Night's Long Fingers<br><b>Level/School:</b> 2nd/Illusion (Phantasm)<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target: </b>One creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance: </b>No</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>At your touch, the target seems almost to leak. A 
tiny plume of jet-black mist emerges from his flesh, first in a trickle,
 then an ever-increasing stream.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The mist emerging from the subject is an illusion that 
only you can see. It constantly drifts from the subject to your 
location, providing a nearly foolproof way of finding and identifying 
the subject. The trail stretches for a number of miles equal to half 
your shadowcaster level, so it is possible for the target to escape your
 detection if he moves fast enough (or <i>teleports</i>). If the subject
 leaves the plane, the trail ends, though it resumes if he returns 
before the duration expires. The haze allows you to track the target, 
identify him if he disguises himself, or even locate the square he is in
 should he become invisible.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Umbral Fist<br></b> Apprentice, Night's Long Fingers<br><b>Level/School:</b> 3rd/Transmutation<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target: </b>You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Your hand turns jet black and seems to flicker as tiny wisps of shadow constantly leak from between your fingers and disappear.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">For the duration of this mystery, you can, as a standard
 action, make a special attack against any foe within medium range (100 
ft. + 10 ft./level). You must have line of sight to the target.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can make any one of the following special attacks: 
bull rush, disarm, or trip. For purposes of adjudicating these attacks, 
make your touch attack as normal, if one is necessary. When actually 
resolving the opposed roll, however, substitute your caster level for 
your base attack bonus and either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier
 (your choice) for your Strength. Because the attack is made at a 
distance, it does not draw an attack of opportunity that such an attack 
would draw under normal circumstances, nor can your foe attempt to 
perform the same maneuver on you in turn, even if such is normally 
allowed.</p>
