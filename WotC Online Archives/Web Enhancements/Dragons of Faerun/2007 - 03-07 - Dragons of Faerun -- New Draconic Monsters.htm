<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p align="left">When books are written at Wizards of the Coast, there is usually material left "on the cutting room floor," so to speak. <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/953797200">Dragons of Faerun</a></i>
 was a massive undertaking last summer, and there was plenty of extra 
material. This enhancement introduces you to two new monsters: The first
 is a new spawn of Tiamat; the second is a new template that can be 
applied to any dragon to make it even more dangerous in its own lair 
(and harmless elsewhere)--the hoarder dragon. Introduce these to your 
players right away, and watch them freak as the next dragon hoard 
attacks them.</p>

 liquid within 30 ft. of a blackspawn corruptor spoils and becomes 
toxic. Should a creature drink the spoiled liquid, it must make a 
Fortitude save (DC 20) or suffer 2 points of permanent Strength drain. 
The DC is Constitution-based. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Corruptive Splash (Su):</b> As a full round action, 
the corruptor can splash all those within 10 feet of her pool with toxic
 water. All creatures take 1d6 acid damage, and must make a Reflex save 
(DC 15) or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Those immune to poison are immune 
to this attack. The save is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Watery Death Urge (Sp):</b> Three times per day, a 
blackspawn corruptor can implant a suggestion in the mind of a creature 
within 30 feet. It the victim fails a Fortitude save (DC 15), it feels 
an urge to leap into the pool. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the 
save is Charisma-based. Creatures in the pool suffer 1d6 points of acid 
damage each round and are blinded. Each round they must make a Fortitude
 save as if they had drunk the water.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Bite, Fortitude (DC 15), initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Aquatic Ambush</b>: A blackspawn corruptor can take a
 standard action at any point during a move, as long it begins and ends 
completely submerged in water. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Tiamat's Blessing (Su):</b> Blackspawn corruptors can
 grant poison and acid immunity to all spawn of Tiamat within 60 ft. 
They can choose to lower this at any point.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills</b>: A blackspawn corruptor has a +8 racial 
bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a 
hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if 
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, 
provided it swims in a straight line. </p>
<p align="left"> Blackspawn corruptors are hybrids between wyrmling 
black dragons and green hags. They are crafty tacticians who guard 
hidden places for Tiamat. They are the most reclusive of the spawn. </p>
<p align="left"><b>STRATEGIES AND TACTICS</b></p>
<p align="left">A blackspawn corruptor rarely engages a foe in full-on 
melee. It waits in its corrupt pool, jumping out at foes and attacking, 
only to submerge itself again in the water. It likes to vary the order 
of its attacks. One moment she jumps out and bites; the next, it 
splashes enemies with putrid water. It patiently whittles away the 
defenses of its opponents. When it has softened its prey enough, it 
converges for an all-out assault. </p>
<p align="left">A blackspawn corruptor is never found with others of its
 kind, but will occasionally work with other spawns of Tiamat. It lords 
its blessing of Tiamat over spawn allies, knowing that with but a whim, 
she could lower the resistance, and assault these pawns with her deadly 
attacks. Other spawn of Tiamat, or young and juvenile black dragons, 
sometimes guard blackspawn corruptors. </p>
<p align="left"><b>SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS</b></p>
<p align="left">Blackspawn corruptors are usually encountered alone. 
Despite this, the lairs they select often contain natural and unnatural 
hazards. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Brackish Pit (EL 8): </b>This large pit in the Vast 
Swamp contains a pool of water corrupted by a blackspawn corruptor named
 Aagreech. Her father was Irexanitar (Female Adult Black Dragon Sorcerer
 10), a black dragon that occasionally made forays into the Vast Swamp. 
Irexanitar was contacted by Faerlaur Onthim, High Dragonservant of the 
Sembian cell of the Cult of the Dragon. The cultists promised her riches
 beyond compare if she would agree to their experiments. They performed 
their experiments, but the cell was destroyed before the results were 
discovered. Irex gave birth to Aagreech, a noxious creature who she 
promptly dropped into the swamp. Aagreech has recruited a group of 
lizardfolk to guard her. She sits on a throne made of bone that she dug 
up from a previous civilization. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Hag Feud (EL 8): </b>In the Lizard Swamp, a feud 
occurs between a blackspawn corruptor and a green hag. The green hag 
wishes to stake claim to a section of the swamp, but the blackspawn 
corruptor is putrefying the area, making it uninhabitable. </p>
<p align="left"><b>ECOLOGY</b></p>
<p align="left">Unlike other spawns of Tiamat, blackspawn corruptors are
 abandoned by their black dragon parents. They use their powers to stake
 claim to an area, often surrounding themselves with others they can 
bully into servitude. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Environment</b>:<b></b>Blackspawn corruptors live in 
dank forgotten places - swamps, abandoned wells, and flooded sinkholes. 
They come in conflict with other denizens because of their putrefying 
aura. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Typical Physical Characteristics</b>: A blackspawn 
corruptor appears stunted at about 3 ft., though it is heavily muscled. 
Its skin is covered in mottled black dragon scales. Its face is a cross 
between a hideous crone and a wyrmling black dragon, and is framed by 
lank lusterless black hair. It exudes a stench of rotting eggs and 
decay. </p>

(arcana) checks as they relate to blackspawn corruptors. Their heritage

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Hoarder Dragon</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2007%20-%2003-07%20-%20Dragons%20of%20Faerun%20--%20New%20Draconic%20Monsters_files/fx20070307_we_hoarder.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="342" width="240"><i>You
 approach the abandoned treasure hoard. As you get close enough to touch
 the glittering coins, you feel a palpable aura of terror, as the entire
 massive pile comes to life. Where the monstrosity should have eyes, 
flesh, claws, and teeth, it has gems, coins, daggers, and swords. </i></p>
<p align="left">Hoarders are dragons who were so greedy in life that 
when they died, they could not abandon their treasure. While they hold 
many similarities to ghosts, these creatures manifest for entirely 
different reasons. Their unfettered avarice causes them to haunt the 
site of their hoard, unwilling to give up a single coin. It will do 
whatever is necessary to prevent other creatures from acquiring any of 
its treasure. It will use items in its hoard when it feels threatened, 
but otherwise, it attempts to dispatch foes with its physical attacks 
and breath weapon. </p>
<p align="left">The most common tactic among hoarders is to wait on the 
ethereal plane until creatures come to steal its hoard. Most creatures 
are taken by surprise when the hoard animates and attacks them without 
warning. </p>
<p align="left">In life, most hoarders worshipped Task, the dragon god 
of greed. Scholars suggest that he rewards them for their service by 
transforming them into hoarders when they die. They point out that the 
creatures usually use gems the color of their scales for eyes.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Sample Hoarder Dragon</b></p>
<p align="left">Amilektrevitrioelis is one of the greediest dragons in 
the world. He hoards loot in his lair in the Rathgaunt Hills, filling 
numerous caverns with treasure from around the world. Amilek collects 
treasure of all types, ranging from massive mountains of copper pieces 
to enormous gem stones and powerful magic items. He previously resided 
in the Anauroch region, but greed and paranoia - along with frequent 
battles against Iymrith "the Doom of the Desert" - lead him to relocate.
 His current residence is unusual among his kind - who usually prefer 
more arid environments - but that suits him fine because he doesn't want
 anyone to discover his hoard.</p>
<p align="left">As Amilek grew in size and greed, he attracted the 
attention of Task, the dragon god of greed. Most blues have aspirations 
of tyranny and domination, but Amilek was an exception. Task loved to 
watch the avaricious blue writhing in his mountains of coins, spending 
months cataloging his wealth, down to the last copper piece. Amilek was 
one of Task's favorite, receiving numerous gifts from The Taker 
throughout the years.</p>
<p align="left">Amilektrevitrieolis' greatest love is treasure, but his 
taste for ghostwise halflings is a close second. He relishes the sounds 
of their voices in his head as he slowly crunches. He spits out their 
bones, posing their skeletons in macabre scenes.</p>
<p align="left">During the Rage of Dragons, Wayland Haltspear (LN male 
ghostwise halfling cleric Sheela Peryroyl 5/divine oracle 10) performed 
constant divinations, seeking advanced warning of dragon flights. 
Wayland served as the high priest and leader of the Stonevine tribe of 
the Channathwood. He was especially worried about an attack from Amilek,
 a frequent foe of his tribe. After weeks of divinations, he finally 
received a vision from the Watchful Mother. He saw Amilek slaughtering 
his people, charring some with its electric breath and eating the 
others. He had no choice but to call on the most powerful warrior of his
 tribe, an outcast who had been banished from the tribe--his brother. </p>
<p align="left">Wayland swallowed his pride and cast a <i>sending</i> to
 his brother Blaen Haltspear (LG male ghostwise halfling monk 6/fist of 
Zuoken 10). In 1364, Blaen was cast out of the tribe for bringing his 
human adventuring companions into the tribe's territory. Since that 
point, he's wandered the world, exploring and learning esoteric fighting
 arts. Feeling like a fair-weather friend, but not wishing his tribe to 
be slaughtered, Blaen came back to his tribe. He returned with his 
companions, asserting that if the tribe wanted his help, they had to 
accept his choices and his friends. Blaen and Wayland put their problems
 aside and led a mixed group of halflings and adventurers in a strike 
against Amilek. </p>
<p align="left">Protected by the priestly magic of the halflings, as 
well as the psionics and spellcasting of Blaen and his party, the attack
 caught Amilek by surprise. The casters pelted him with magic, while the
 warriors bombarded him with arrows, skiprocks, swords, and spears. 
Enraged by the impetuousness of the attack, and compounded by the Rage, 
Amilek retaliated with his most devastating attacks - huge lines of 
lightning, fireballs, and other magical attacks. This was unusual for 
Amilek, who never liked to deplete his hoard. The dragon nearly 
triumphed, but in the end he was destroyed. </p>
<p align="left">The group may have prevailed, but they paid a terrible 
price. With the exception of Blaen, almost everyone was killed, 
including several of the halfling warrior's companions and his brother 
Wayland. The dragon cursed Blaen with Task's most terrible artifact - 
the Shackles of Amilek. (For more details on the Shackles of Amilek, see
 the item description below). Blaen was devastated with grief over the 
loss companions, tribesman, and kin. He felt duty-bound to help the 
tribe recover, but also wanted to alert the families of his companions 
about their deaths. He could do neither because of the shackles that 
caused him to become blind and deaf. What he did not know was that the 
spirit of Amilek still existed, called back to the treasure hoard by its
 dark master. </p>
<p align="left">Currently, Amilektrevitrioelis is feeling out the limits
 of his new form. In most ways, he prefers his new existence. He is 
better able to defend his treasure and is nearly impossible to destroy. 
While he has no mobility, being unable to range far from the hoard, he 
no longer has to worry about being surprised.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hoard</b>: 30,000 gp, 150,000 sp, 400,000 cp, 2 blue 
diamonds (10,000 gp each), 17 pink diamonds (2,500 gp each), 30 
Sapphires of various colors (750 gp each), 15,000 gp worth of masterwork
 weapons and armor, platinum and jade replica of an ancient Shoon palace
 (11,000 gp), iolite and mithril tressym inscribed with the symbol of 
Bast (10,500 gp), 3 non-functional shield guardians, 5 mithril and blue 
spinel goblets from Myth Adofhaer (10,000 gp together), 12 petrified 
mounted Shaaryan hunters, <i>+2 mithril and ruby elven full plate armor</i> with the symbol of House Floshin, <i>+3 heavy steel shield</i>, <i>+2 keen longsword</i>, <i>+3 longsword</i>, 50 <i>+1 daggers</i>, <i>gauntlet of rust</i>, <i>metamagic rod of lesser maximize</i>, the shackles of Amilek, scroll of <i>daylight</i>, scroll of <i>ice storm</i>, scroll of <i>flame strike</i> (CL 15th), scroll of <i>flesh to stone</i>, scroll of <i>invisibility purge</i>, scroll of <i>obscure object</i>, scroll of <i>poison</i>, scroll of <i>power word stun</i>, <i>wand of contagion</i> (42 charges), <i>wand of magic missile</i> (CL 7th, 30 charges), <i>wand of fireball</i> (CL 5th, 28 charges), <i>wand of pebble wind</i> (CL 6th, 39 charges). </p>
<p align="left"><b>Lair</b>: Amilektrevitrioelis lives in a series of 
caves in one of the higher mountains in the Rathgaunt Hills. Each cave 
in his lair is dedicated to a type of creature. Separate caves exist for
 platinum, gold, silver, copper, gems, art, magic, and curiosities such 
as petrified humanoids, broken constructs, heads of magical beasts, and 
other strange objects. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics</b>: Like most hoarders, Amilek likes to wait
 in the ethereal plane, ready to pounce on intruders. He prefers to use 
his physical attacks, especially his breath weapon and energy draining 
bite. While extremely capable with scrolls and wands, he hates to do 
anything that depletes his hoard. He tests his opponents, staying on the
 defensive long enough to get a sense of the capabilities of his foes. 
If he feels threatened, he retreats to the ethereal and readies wands 
and scrolls, waiting for an opportune time to return with the element of
 surprise. If he feels truly threatened, he attacks in melee and uses 
wands or scrolls each round. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Known Allies</b>: Amilek has never been interested in
 making friends. Other blue dragons find him too greedy and paranoid to 
make a good ally. He is so focused on the acquisition of treasure that 
he rarely participates in the grand plots and schemes that many dragons 
enjoy. He spends most of his time attacking local creatures, 
adventurers, and caravans, slowly building up his hoard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Known Enemies</b>: Amilek is constantly at odds with 
the Stonvines of the Channathwood. He likes to snack on the ghostwise 
halflings of that tribe, making mortal enemies of the small folk. The 
gnomes of the Shield of the Rathgaunt Hills Abbey, a small cult that 
worships Gaerdal Ironhand, have frequently fought against the rampages 
of the greedy dragon. </p>
<p align="left">Amilek is an enemy of two dragons in or near the Shaar. 
Moraughaloth (CG Male Young Adult Copper, Council Hills) has taunted the
 blue mercilessly, though always a safe distance from the powerful butt 
of his jokes. The copper is mildly amused by the obsessively greedy 
blue. Nygethrokantos (LN Male Forest Landwyrm Drac Druid 8) has 
constantly fought with Amilek over the blue's complete disregard for the
 ecosystems of the region. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge Checks</b>: Locating Amilek's lair on a map
 is possible with a DC 25 bardic knowledge, Knowledge (geography), or 
Knowledge (local) (The Shaar) check. Gather Information (DC 30) can be 
used among the ghostwise halflings, assuming that those inquiring can 
get close enough to speak with the reclusive and xenophobic tribe. The 
gnomes in the Abbey in the hills are more willing to talk (DC 22). </p>
<p align="left"><b>Adventure Hooks</b>: Following Amilek's 
transformation, a flight of dragonnes began to roost in his caverns. The
 hoarder destroyed half of the dragonnes, adding their treasure to his 
hoard. Normally, these creatures act as a balancing force, keeping the 
manticore and peryton populations at bay. When the dragonnes left, a 
major hole opened up in the ecology of the region. The manticores now 
hunt in the territories normally used by the dragonnes, throwing the 
entire ecology into chaos. The perytons deplete the land of game, making
 it harder for other species to survive. The local druids are frantic, 
seeking anyone who can identify the cause of the problem and fix it. The
 halflings and gnomes need help defending themselves against the 
aggressive hunting of these predators. In order to allow the ecosystem 
to heal, the abomination throwing the region of balance must be 
destroyed. After that, the dragonnes should come back, allowing the land
 to come back into balance. Nygethrokantos might prove to be a helpful 
ally in this endeavor. He is an expert on the nature and geography of 
this region. </p>
<p align="left">An oracle of the church of Savras in the Border Kingdoms
 named Phrilda (LN Female Shaaryan Cleric of Savras 14) has a vision of 
evil rising in the caves of the Rathgaunt Hills. Throughout the dreams, a
 single image of five coins keeps recording. Unsure of what it means, 
but certain that Savras wants her to investigate, the oracle sends out a
 call for able-bodied adventurers to escort her to the hills where they 
can investigate these visions. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 100-ft. line of electrified coins, damage 7d8 electricity plus 7d8 bludgeoning, Reflex DC 24 half. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Create/Destroy Water (Sp):</b> Amilektrevitrioelis 
can use this ability three times per day. It work like the create water 
spell, except that the dragon can decide to destroy water instead of 
creating it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing 
water. Magic items (such as potions), and items in a creature's 
possession, must succeed on Will saves (DC 29) or be ruined. This 
ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Crush (Ex):</b> Area 15 ft. by 15 ft.; Small or 
smaller opponents take 2d8+11 points of bludgeoning damage, and must 
succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be pinned. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Hoard Possession</b>: As a free action, 
Amilektrevitrioelis can possess its treasure hoard, animating the coins,
 weapons, gems, and other items into a draconic shape similar to its 
form in life. In this form, it can make all of its normal and special 
attacks. All items absorbed into the body strike as magic weapons. In 
addition, it can use magic items that are part of its hoard. Once per 
round, as a free action, it can activate a magic item (including 
spell-completion items). It automatically succeeds in the use of 
spell-completion items, without the need for a Use Magic Device check. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Hoard Sense:</b> A hoarder has the ability to sense when any creature approaches within 100 feet of its hoard. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b> 210-ft. radius, HD 23 or less, Will DC 29 negates. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rejuvenation:</b> When Amilektrevitrioelis would 
otherwise be destroyed, it returns to its hoard in 2d4 daysssful level 
check (1d20 + 24) against DC 16. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, and 
the treasure hoard is removed from its location and broken up using a 
successful <i>break enchantment</i> spell, <i>greater dispel magic</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell vs. 11 + the hoarder's hit dice (35), it is destroyed forever. </p>
<p><b>Sound Imitation (Ex):</b> Amilektrevitrioelis can mimic any voice 
or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed on a 
Will save (DC 29) to detect the ruse.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Creating a Hoarder</b></p>
<p align="left">"Hoarder" is a template that can be added to any nongood
 dragon (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A hoarder uses all
 of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted
 here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Size and Type</b>: The creature's type changes to 
undead. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or 
skill points. It gains the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hit Dice:</b> All current and future Hit Dice become d12s. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Speed</b>: The hoarder keeps the base creature's fly 
speed (if any), but has perfect maneuverability. If the hoarder's 
original form did not have a fly speed, it gains a fly speed of 30 
(perfect maneuverability). The hoarder keeps the base creature's land 
speed when it has manifested, but if that form had the ability to burrow
 or climb, those forms of movement are lost.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Armor Class:</b> Natural armor is 5 less than the 
base creature's while possessing its hoard. When on the ethereal plane, 
its natural armor is the same as the base creature. When possessing its 
hoard, it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1,
 whichever is higher.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Attacks:</b> A hoarder retains all the attacks of the
 base creature. When possessing its hoard, it cannot affect creatures on
 the ethereal plane. Likewise, when on the ethereal plane, it cannot 
attack creatures on the material plane.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Damage:</b> A hoarder uses the base creature's damage
 values, though all damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty. This penalty is 
subtracted from the total, after any other modifiers. On the ethereal 
plane, it does not suffer a damage penalty.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Attacks: </b>A hoarder retains all the 
special attacks of the base creature, except as noted. The hoarder also 
gains a number of special attacks. The save DC against a special attack 
is equal to 10 + ½ base creature's HD + hoarder's Cha modifier unless 
otherwise noted. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Avaricious bite: </i>A hoarder can steal its victim's
 life force with a bite. Creatures hit by its bite attack suffer one 
negative level. For each negative level bestowed, the hoarder gains 5 
temporary hit points. The hoarder retains the hit points for one hour. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Breath Weapon: </i>A hoarder can breathe a spray of 
coins mixed with the normal energy of its breath weapon. Half the damage
 is bludgeoning, the other half energy. In all other ways, it functions 
as the base creature's breath weapon. If the base creature's breath 
weapon does not do damage, such as that of a shadow dragon, its effects 
are unchanged, though it appears to be suffused with coins. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Qualities: </b>A hoarder has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Hoard Possession: </i>As a free action, the hoarder 
can possess its treasure hoard, animating the coins, weapons, gems, and 
other items into a draconic shape similar to its form in life. Weapons 
become its claws and bite, coins its body, and gems its eyes. In this 
form, it can make all of its normal and special attacks. All items 
absorbed into the body strike as magic weapons. In addition, it can use 
magic items that are part of its hoard. Once per round, as a free 
action, it can activate a magic item (including spell-completion items).
 It automatically succeeds in the use of spell-completion items, without
 the need for a Use Magic Device check. </p>
<p align="left">When a hoarder is not possessing its hoard, it dwells on
 the ethereal plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be
 affected by anything in the material world. When a spellcasting hoarder
 is not possessing its hoard and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells 
cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally 
against ethereal targets.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Hoard Sense:</i> A hoarder has the ability to sense when any creature approaches within 100 feet of its hoard. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Rejuvenation: </i>In most cases, it's difficult to 
destroy a hoarder through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will 
often restore itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are 
usually only temporary solutions. A hoarder that would otherwise be 
destroyed returns to its hoard with a successful level check (1d20 + 
hoarder's HD) against DC 16. If the hoarder is reduced to 0 hit points 
and the treasure hoard is removed from its location and broken up using a
 successful <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>greater dispel magic</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell vs. 11 + the hoarder's hit dice, the creature is destroyed forever. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Turn Resistance:</i> A hoarder has +4 turn resistance. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Abilities:</b> Same as the base creature, except that the hoarder has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills: </b>Hoarders have a +8 racial bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Challenge Rating </b>Same as base creature +2 <br><b>Organization: </b>Solitary.<br><b>Treasure: </b>Quadruple Standard. <br><b>Level Adjustment: </b>Same as the base creature +4. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="2007%20-%2003-07%20-%20Dragons%20of%20Faerun%20--%20New%20Draconic%20Monsters_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Major Artifact: The Shackles of Amilek</b></p>
<p align="left">Aura: Overpowering; (DC 25) Necromancy, Transmutation<br> Activation: -<br> Weight: 10 lb. </p>
<p align="left">"<i>The halfling stumbles, his arms and legs bound by 
heavy iron shackles. Upon each shackle is a faded symbol of five piled 
coins, barely visible on the dull metal surface</i>."</p>
<p align="left">This set of arm and leg shackles was created by Task for
 his favorite worshipper, the blue dragon Amilektrevitrioelis. It served
 as a protection for Amilek's hoard, binding the arms and legs of the 
dragon's slayer, preventing him from claiming the treasure. The set 
renders its wearer blind and deaf, unable to steal the dragon's 
treasure. The wearer of the shackles receives nightmares from Task each 
night (as the <i>nightmare</i> spell). In these dreams, he is floating 
along in a plane of magma and jagged rocks, surrounded by hundreds of 
different types of dragons, all of whom are using their breath weapons 
and magic to harm the dreamer. The wearer feels all the pain of those 
effects, waking up many mornings with blood leaking from his eyes, nose,
 and mouth, and feeling completely exhausted. </p>
<p align="left">The hoarder that cursed the wearer can cast <i>greater scrying</i>
 on the wearer once per day. The hoarder is considered to know the 
wearer well and the shackles act as a conduit. They count as a personal 
object that the hoarder can use for his spells.</p>
<p align="left">There are some significant benefits to the shackles. The
 wearer can reshape the mercurial metal into other metallic forms - any 
combinations of armor, weapons, and tools. The armor can be made into <i>+1 mithril ghost touch full plate</i>,
 but has no armor check penalty, no maximum Dexterity, and is nearly 
weightless. Any weapons created from the shackles are +1 ghost touch 
weapons of the wearer's choosing and size. Any tool created is magical, 
imparting a +5 bonus on skill checks requiring that object. The shaping 
effect only works when the wearer is in combat or using that skill. At 
other times, the wearer must walk with the shackles at half speed and 
cannot run. </p>
<p align="left">Scholars believe that there are at least two other sets 
of these shackles, each dedicated to dragon of legendary greed. They say
 that the only way to remove the shackles is by destroying the creature 
that cursed the wearer, followed by receiving a <i>wish</i> spell cast 
by a good dragon, then convincing a worshipper of Tiamat to accept 
"Bahamut's blessing," though they are not entirely sure what that means.
 The only known way to destroy the shackles is by having 20 different 
species of dragon use their breath weapon on the item. Following that, 
the shackles must be dropped into an erupting volcano on the Plane of 
Fire on an anniversary of the day the shackles were created.</p>
