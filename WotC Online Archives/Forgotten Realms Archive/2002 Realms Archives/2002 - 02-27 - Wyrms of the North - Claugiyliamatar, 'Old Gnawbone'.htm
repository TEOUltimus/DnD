<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2002-27%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Claugiyliamatar,%20%27Old%20Gnawbone%27_files/dragon_233_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">The
 Volo and Elminster survey of current dragon rulers of the North 
continues with one of the most infamous hero-banes in all Faerûn: the 
vicious, nasty, ancient green dragon known as Claugiyliamatar. This wyrm
 delights in hunting down and slaughtering small armed bands wandering 
in the wilderlands (in other words: adventurers). From time to time she 
varies such activities with devouring a field of almost-ripe grain in 
Goldenfields or tearing apart a food-caravan bound for the northern 
interior and eating men, beasts, and cargo alike. Claugiyliamatar 
usually signals this last sort of triumph by plucking up a caravan 
wagon, flying very high (to avoid the attention of griffon-back city 
patrols until it's too late), and dropping the wagon down as a lethal 
missile on the roofs of Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2">Some ballads call Claugiyliamatar "Old Gnawbone" for 
her habit of carrying a corpse dangling from her jaws to munch on 
absently from time to time, just as some humans suck on unlit pipes or 
chew cigars. She is cunning, paranoid, and possessed of a cruel sense of
 humor: Trapped victims have been known to escape her because she played
 with them to watch their pain and suffering instead of slaughtering 
them outright.</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar lives alone, driving away male green 
dragons who come courting, but rumors state that she employs several 
dozen loyal human and halfling agents to work behind the scenes for her 
in the less savory side of business in Neverwinter and Waterdeep. In 
particular, these agents make profits on goods made scarce by the 
dragon's attacks. Old Gnawbone seems to enjoy manipulating affairs in 
the cities for the sake of wielding secret power, not for the wealth it 
brings her. Little treasure is brought back to her lair; all but the 
coins pocketed by her agents -- misdemeanors Claugiyliamatar pointedly 
ignores if the amounts stay small -- is invested in businesses meant to 
stir up rivalries and gain her ever-more-powerful organizations, 
allowing her more swiftly and thoroughly to create trouble in her next 
scheme!</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar is fascinated by human and elven women 
who wield power, and she spends hours watching them from her lair 
through her array of <i>crystal balls</i>. This collection of scrying 
spheres marks the second thing that fascinates Claugiyliamatar: magic, 
especially items that allow her to take human form and participate in 
the things humans do (knifings in alleyways, for example, and passionate
 courting, and, well, drinking). Her personal spells are too weak to 
enable her to take human shape, so she watches the nobles of Waterdeep 
and the sorcerers of Neverwinter for hours at a time, learning who has 
magic and where it is hidden, before sending her agents forth to steal 
it. Woe betides an agent who tries to cheat Old Gnawbone out of even the
 tiniest scrap of magic: He will find himself nailed to a tree deep in 
the forest, drenched with blood, and left for the wolves (or other 
hungry forest denizens).</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar herself hungers for the bustle and 
intrigue of city life in the form of a human, but she wishes to call on 
her full range of dragon powers while in that form. She was almost 
tricked into servitude once by a wizard, Hyrix Greentree of Waterdeep, 
whom she hired to craft her a variant <i>shapechange</i> spell. The 
magic would have transformed her into a beautiful human maiden, yet 
leave her able to call on her magic, breath weapon, and immunities. She 
discovered, however, that while in human form she would have been 
Hyrix's <i>charmed</i> slave, and he would have ensured that her desire 
to return to dragon-shape was firmly quenched. Hyrix died slowly and 
painfully, and if the phantom of a screaming wizard silently fades into 
view from time to time above the spell scroll Claugiyliamatar keeps 
carefully hidden in a coffer beneath the floor of her lair, she ignores 
it.</p>
<p class="size2">Having her own way is everything to Claugiyliamatar. 
Among other dragons, her reputation for trickery makes her best avoided.
 Balagos, for instance, considers her a twisted, crabbed thing given to 
petty silliness and, as such, beneath his notice.</p>
<p class="size2">She is a tireless foe who goes to ridiculous lengths to
 cause even small harm to someone she regards as an enemy, and this 
"worry-all-the-bones" trait has made most other dragons leave her alone.
 This is just fine with Old Gnawbone, as it leaves her free to pursue 
her schemes wrapped in the presumption of her own supremacy over other 
dragons. It also leaves her great Waterdeep as part of her territory. 
That more than a dozen dragons dwell in the city under her very nose, 
and generally regard her activities with amusement, is something she 
serenely ignores, even when one of her agents is imprudent enough to 
point it out to her.</p>
<p class="size2">How those in authority -- in particular, women of power
 -- wield their influence and legal might is something Claugiyliamatar 
never tires of studying. Increasingly she has turned to scrying 
Alustriel's Palace in Silverymoon, and even distant Twilight Hall in 
Berdusk. She seems unaware that her snooping was detected long ago in 
both of those places. Junior mages in both cities now take turns honing 
their illusion-weaving skills by spinning false scenes of intrigue for 
the green dragon to watch. The impish mage Ralderston Tinter of 
Silverymoon has even taken to crafting scenes of a handsome young green 
dragon who takes on human form to court ladies of high station. It has 
been observed that Claugiyliamatar's agents are visiting Silverymoon in a
 steady stream these days, looking for a certain young man with the 
emerald eyes of a <i>shapechanged</i> green dragon.</p>
<p class="size2">Certain mages of Silverymoon have been weaving spells 
that can be cast covertly on an unwitting agent, to be triggered by Old 
Gnawbone's presence: spells made to plunge the green dragon into a long,
 heavy slumber, so adventurers can safely reach her lair for a massed 
attack. So far, the castings they've attempted have failed. For her 
part, Claugiyliamatar seems not to have noticed. She has explained away 
the occasional clumsy images and distortions she observes through her <i>crystal balls</i> as the defensive magic her scrying is penetrating.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Claugiyliamatar's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Old Gnawbone has her lair in a cavern in Kryptgarden 
Forest, at the end of a deep ravine that runs from the base of one of 
the mountains that bounds the old, thickly-grown woods on the north. 
Several tombs and abandoned dwarfholds pierce the mountain walls nearby,
 including the infamous monster-haunted complex known as Southkrypt. 
Claugiyliamatar employs both human agents and woodland creatures as 
guards around her lair, and these guardians lead intruders astray 
(sometimes with the aid of <i>ghost sound</i> and other spells she casts herself) into waiting traps or into one of the waiting perils of another cave.</p>
<p class="size2">The green dragon doesn't seem to have a name for her 
abode, but to humans it's Deeping Cave, a name of forgotten origin that 
it possessed long before Claugiyliamatar arrived (in 1303 DR, most sages
 believe).</p>
<p class="size2"> The cave gapes at the end of a gloomy, vine-crossed 
gully overhung by gigantic old oaks and duskwoods. Within, Old 
Gnawbone's lair is a weird place of creeping phosphorescent lichens, 
giant toadstools, and hanging mosses draped over statues of imperious 
human women (warriors, mostly) looted from a dozen tombs. (At least one 
of the statues is believed to be an emerald golem, detailed in <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>.)</p>
<p class="size2">At the back of the cave, Claugiyliamatar slithers about in the gloom from her bed of coins to the alcove where her <i>crystal balls</i>
 glow and flicker. She often spends hours sprawled before them, watching
 what befalls far away, while a servant (always a man clad only in 
manacles and chains, though these are a decorative costume he can remove
 whenever desired) oils her soft scales with tree-sap and ointments made
 to the dragon's own formulae from crushed and boiled forest leaves, 
fungi, and roots.</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar is vain and believes she will stay 
youthful and supple if her scales are tended daily, polished with these 
healthy substances to a deep, almost blue emerald hue. Those who anoint 
her are allowed to scoop up as many coins they can grasp in one hand 
(only!) from her hoard-bed as payment when they leave. Thus, attending 
the dragon is a popular duty among her servants -- though one must be 
careful to do nothing to make Old Gnawbone suspect treachery; she's been
 known to roll over with sudden, deliberate speed and crush a servant 
beneath her bulk.<b></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b> Claugiyliamatar's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From Deeping Cave, Claugiyliamatar holds sway over a 
dominion that stretches from the southern bank of the River Mirar down 
the Sword Coast to the north bank of the Dessarin, and along the western
 fringes of the High Forest to about Dead Horse Ford, where it swings 
north and west in a wide arc over the Evermoors to take in Nesmó, 
Longsaddle, and Grunwald, to reach the Mirar south of Mirabar. If all 
the borders of her territory are disputed by other dragons (particularly
 northern Neverwinter Wood and the land between the Dessarin and the 
High Forest) and her ability to waltz into Waterdeep is more fantasy 
than something she dares do, Claugiyliamatar cares not. She rarely flies
 anywhere east of the Long Road and seldom leaves her lair in any case, 
preferring to watch through her scrying crystals and have agents work 
for her. (Those servants who contemplate treachery have learned to their
 cost that she does on occasion closely watch just how they carry out 
her orders.) This habitual idleness does not keep her from jealously 
defending her dominion when young dragons scout it -- and, seeing no 
draconic occupant, decide to settle in.</p>
<p class="size2">Lance Rock, a landmark west of the Long Road south of 
Red Larch, looks as if a gigantic boulder were hurled down from the sky 
to strike deep into the ground -- and that's just what happened. A brash
 young adult red dragon, Smergadas, liked the look of the lands around 
the Dessarin. After flying about unchallenged for most of a day, he 
filled his belly with roaming deer and curled up for a nap -- whereupon 
Old Gnawbone, who'd been watching him through one of her crystals, 
emerged from her lair, plucked a loose boulder almost as large as 
herself from atop the mountains, and flew over to drop it on him. Then 
she landed to fill her own belly with foolish red dragon.<b></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b> Deeds of Claugiyliamatar</b></p>
<p class="size2">The favorite prey of Claugiyliamatar is adventurers, 
particularly human males, but she does enjoy the taste of dragon-meat. 
When orc hordes sweep down from the mountains, Claugiyliamatar emerges 
from her lair and gorges herself, devouring the orcs by the hundreds 
until, too bloated to fight any more, she labors back to her lair and 
crawls inside to sleep off her feast. Sages have identified such 
occasions as the time when she's most vulnerable. Of course, when orcs 
are streaming by the thousands down into the lands of civilized men, 
dragon-hunting is a luxury no one can afford.</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar prefers to hunt between Westwood and 
Kryptgarden Forest (on deer, cattle, or human travelers that she can 
catch in the open), or if she's feeling more energetic, in Neverwinter 
Wood south of the river. She drinks from the mountain streams that empty
 into the Mere of Dead Men, or sometimes from the lake that feeds the 
Laughingflow, or the Dessarin itself. Most of her days are spent scrying
 and sleeping but she can break her sloth with periods of agile, 
lightning-quick flight, and fighting if need be.</p>
<p class="size2">Adventurers know Claugiyliamatar for the grim toll of 
their ranks she's exacted down the years, and in particular for the time
 she posed as a silver dragon to dupe a Waterdhavian noble (the late 
Saerlin Brokengulf, head of his house at the time). In her disguise, she
 tricked Saerlin into hiring her to rid the Brokengulf grazing lands of 
herself. She learned through scrying where her payment was being 
assembled, used magic (<i>alter self</i>) to appear as a silver dragon 
again, and in that guise destroyed the place, seizing all the coins and 
devouring all the guards, and then flew to the Brokengulf ranch and used
 illusions (<i>persistent image</i>) to make it seem as though a titanic
 midair battle was being fought by a silver dragon and a green. In the 
process, she smashed fences, allowing the terrified livestock to flee 
out into the open grasslands for her later dining pleasure. The battling
 dragons disappeared west over the mountains, and a battered and angry 
silver dragon subsequently perched atop the Brokengulf abode in 
Waterdeep and demanded the payment for slaying Claugiyliamatar. Lord 
Brokengulf had to scramble to find alternative funds (as the silver 
dragon made it clear the alternative was to lose the house the wyrm sat 
upon), and the silver dragon flew away straining to hold aloft a 
Brokengulf boat plucked up from the harbor and crammed full of coins.</p>
<p class="size2">Old Gnawbone spent a leisurely tenday arranging coins 
in several hidden mountain caches (emptying her bed in Deeping Cave), 
then reappeared at Brokengulf Towers as herself -- just as angry, and 
demanding twice the payment the "Silver Slayer" had received to spare 
the lives of the entire Brokengulf family. When Lord Brokengulf played 
for time (trying hastily to hire a wizard to blast away his dragon 
troubles forever), Claugiyliamatar toppled the grandest tower of the 
villa down into its garden, crushing three of Lord Brokengulf's sisters 
and crippling Saerlin himself. She got her payment, though it almost 
emptied the coffers of the noble house. Then she flew happily back to 
her cave, after wrecking the rest of the villa almost as an 
afterthought. She then set all the traps she'd prepared and went off 
with the loot to Neverwinter Wood to hide while all the angry forces of 
Waterdeep scoured Kryptgarden for a dragon so bold as to dare to attack a
 noble of the city in his very home!</p>
<p class="size2">The crowning stroke in Claugiyliamatar's plan was her 
timing of the whole affair to coincide with the first cautious foray 
into her forest of Endracritar, a rival green dragon from the High 
Forest near Loudwater. A young male already fearful of the forces of 
Hellgate Keep, Endracritar had been growing increasingly wary of 
Zhentarim incursions near his own lair, and he had been preparing spells
 and stratagems for a decisive attack on Claugiyliamatar for some time. 
Unbeknownst to him, Old, Gnawbone had been scrying on him regularly for 
some time, too -- as she did all the dragons she could find except 
Balagos, whom she didn't quite dare to watch -- and knew all about his 
plan. The strike force from Waterdeep charged into the Kryptgarden 
looking for a rapacious green dragon... and they found one.</p>
<p class="size2">Endracritar's vaunted spells and stratagems were no 
match for the fury of the assembled mages and heroes of Waterdeep. The 
smoke had barely ceased to drift and curl from his blasted bones when 
Claugiyliamatar glided calmly back across the mountains and returned to 
her cave, bringing her best <i>crystal ball</i> with her. It was time to
 spy on another noble family, to find something else she could exploit 
for enrichment, power, and pleasure.</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar may acknowledge her physical and 
magical inferiority to other dragons (such as Balagos), but her behavior
 and occasional comments to agents reveal that she thinks herself 
smarter than all other dragons. She believes that she can manipulate 
other beings to gain her own way in situations where rival wyrms can 
only charge in and fight or lay waste to the surroundings -- to achieve 
their ends by force. Lack of sufficient magic is the only real weakness 
she seems to be working at rectifying; however, her paranoia makes 
finding wizards mighty enough to develop a roster of powerful unique 
spells for her, and to enable her to shift freely between dragon-form 
and human shape, a very difficult task indeed. She's recently come to 
the conclusion that the only way to find such a being may be to raise 
one herself -- to "adopt" a magically-gifted and good-aligned child as a
 mysterious, helpful benefactor, helping the human to grow into a mage 
of power who regards Claugiyliamatar as a friend whom he owes a 
tremendous debt. Yet even this long, exacting process is fraught with 
perils, and Old Gnawbone is proceeding very cautiously, scrying until 
she can find a handful of candidates. If one turns on her, is slain, or 
otherwise "goes bad," she'll then have others without all her time 
entirely wasted . . . and if all of them come to trust her and to master
 magic, she'll have more wizards at her beck and call than most emperors
 in the Realms ever manage!</p>
<p class="size2">Claugiyliamatar has little use for other dragons. She 
feels that mating will only delay or destroy her schemes, forcing her to
 rear offspring who'll inevitably turn on her as they grow up, and she 
fears it will give a male dragon entirely too much knowledge of her 
lair, defenses, and nature. Fear can win the loyalty of lesser 
creatures, however, and Claugiyliamatar is satisfied that very few of 
her carefully selected human agents ever cross her and live to tell the 
tale. She holds no special likes or dislikes of any species, but she 
finds humans both fascinating and useful; she believes their wits and 
dexterity almost equal that of a dragon's.</p>
<p class="size2">In recent seasons, word of her existence seems to be 
spreading slowly in Waterdeep, and more adventurers and young, bored 
nobles gone a-hunting have arrived in her forest; Claugiyliamatar has 
enjoyed taking the magic that these puny foes carry, but she is growing 
alarmed that folk of real power (such as the Lord Mage of Waterdeep, 
Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun) will eventually show up, so she is working
 hard at having her agents eliminate folk who spread rumors of her. The 
flattery of a good ballad, in particular one that speaks of a deadly 
green dragon coiling triumphant about Kryptgarden "long ago," would be 
more welcome. . . .</p>
<p class="size2">So Old Gnawbone lies in her cave, watching the schemes 
and deeds and unfolding lives of humans in bright Waterdeep and the 
other settlements of the North, striving to become ever more subtle in 
what she bids her agents do, so that her power will grow even as 
knowledge of her wanes. She is close to danger, but if she can keep out 
of its reach, there are centuries yet to grow mighty -- and a city just 
pulsing with magic just beyond her very snout . . . magic that might all
 someday be hers.<b></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b> Claugiyliamatar's Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Dragon of Kryptgarden Forest dwells too near 
Waterdeep ever to be truly safe, and if civilization grows in the North 
as most sages expect it to, and settlement spreads up the coast or (more
 likely) up the Long Road, Claugiyliamatar is likely to be discovered 
with increasing regularity and tested by band after band of adventurers.
 Eventually one will be too strong for her, or too lucky -- or her 
continuing slaughter of them will bring a foe she can't defeat to her 
door.</p>
<p class="size2">She could relocate, of course, but Neverwinter Wood is 
too cold for her liking and probably soon to be a territory where 
younger dragons regularly show up to make challenges (to say nothing of 
the white dragon Arveiaturace). The High Forest, with at least three 
incumbent green dragons [<a href="#1">1</a>], is likely to become her 
grave if she dares try to lair there. Claugiyliamatar knows of these 
perils and would prefer to slip away from unwanted foes by taking human 
shape, or otherwise having magic enough to prevail against even the 
mightiest foes.</p>
<p class="size2">If she can see a way to achieve undeath herself, 
without the meddling, manipulative aid of the Cult of the Dragon, she 
may very well do so. The removal of a need to eat and keep warm would 
allow her far more freedom, and she can continue to enjoy her chief 
pursuit and entertainment: spying on humans and other humanoids, and 
manipulating their affairs just to enjoy her power over them.</p>
<p class="size2">Sometimes, though, she dreams of an even better fate: 
ruling Waterdeep as a human queen, her dragon nature hidden. Even more 
often, she sees herself as an alluring, mysterious lady all the noblemen
 and ambitious merchants of the city are wild over, as she glides from 
dark alley trysts to gentle jests at parties, with all eyes on her and 
all tongues darting with the news of her latest outrageous deeds. Her 
servants say Old Gnawbone sighs often as she stares into her <i>crystal balls</i>. . . .</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Claugiyliamatar can breathe a
 60-foot cone of corrosive gas every 1d4 rounds as a standard action for
 20d6 acid damage (Reflex save DC 33 for half damage). Claugiyliamatar 
is immune to her own breath weapon and to those of other green dragons. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Crush:</b> Claugiyliamatar can land on opponents 
three or more sizes smaller than herself as a standard action, using her
 whole body to crush them. A crush attack affects as many opponents as 
can fit under Claugiyliamatar's body. Each creature in the affected area
 must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 33) or be pinned, automatically 
taking bludgeoning damage the next round unless the dragon moves off 
them. If she chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple 
attack. Pinned opponents take crush damage each round if they don't 
escape.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex): </b>This ability takes 
effect automatically. It affects only opponents with fewer than 32 HD or
 levels. The affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 31) 
or become shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to 
Claugiyliamatar's frightful presence for one day. On a failure, 
creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds. Those with 5
 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-like Abilities (Sp):</b> 3/day -- <i>dominate person, suggestion; </i>1/day -- <i>plant growth.</i> Caster Level 13th; save DC 15 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep: </b>Claugiyliamatar can sweep with her 
tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a 
diameter of 30 feet, centered on the dragon's rear. Creatures within the
 swept area are affected if they are four or more sizes smaller than the
 dragon. The sweep automatically deals the listed damage. Any affected 
creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC 33) to take half damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Companion: </b>Claugiyliamatar may have one or more animal companions. This animal is one that she has befriended with the spell <i>animal friendship.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Claugiyliamatar maneuvers and 
fights using nonvisual senses (hearing, scent, vibrations, and other 
environmental clues) as well as a sighted creature does in normal 
lighting. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though she still 
can't discern ethereal beings. The range of her blindsight is 300 feet. 
Claugiyliamatar usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to 
notice creatures within range of her blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If exposed to any effect that 
normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, Claugiyliamatar takes no damage with a successful saving throw</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities: </b>Claugiyliamatar is immune to acid and to paralysis and sleep effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses (Ex): </b>Claugiyliamatar sees four 
times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in 
normal light. She also has darkvision with a range of 1,000 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Nature Sense: </b>Claugiyliamatar can identify 
plants and animals (their species and special traits) with perfect 
accuracy. She can determine whether water is safe to drink or dangerous.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Resist Nature's Lure: </b>Claugiyliamatar gains a +4
 bonus to saving throws against the spell-like abilities of feys (such 
as dryads, nymphs, and sprites).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trackless Step: </b>Claugiyliamatar leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>Claugiyliamatar can react to
 danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains
 her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Water Breathing (Ex): </b>Claugiyliamatar can 
breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use her breath weapon, 
spells, and other abilities while submerged.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Woodland Stride: </b>Claugiyliamatar may move 
through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at 
her normal speed and without suffering damage or other impairment. 
However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or 
magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Druid Spells Prepared </b>(5/5/4; base DC = 15 + spell level): 0 -- <i>cure minor wounds, detect poison, know direction, resistance, virtue;</i> 1st -- <i>cure light wounds, entangle, goodberry, magic fang, pass without trace; </i>2nd -- <i>charm person or animal, force talons, tree shape, wood shape. </i></p>

<p class="size2">The Dragon of Kryptgarden Forest considers her roster

spells detailed here.</p>

<p class="size2"> As <i>spiritual weapon</i>, except it creates a 
translucent line of four black foot-long, razor-sharp nails instead of a
 weapon of force and the damage is only 1d6 points per hit. In addition,
 the target cannot be changed and the weapon stays with the target until
 the target flees beyond the spell's range. The force talons dissipate 
the moment the target moves out of range.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Lesser Fireball</b><br> Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area: </b>5-ft.-radius spread<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">As <i>fireball</i>, except that the burst of flame deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d4).</p>
<p class="size2">Ed Greenwood owns four computers, almost a hundred 
thousand books, a lovely old house, curs, and cottages in the Canadian 
wilderness. He'd trade them all for a chance to spend a day in 
Shadowdale -- or a night at a nobles' revel in Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2">[1] According to Elminster (Volo knows nothing of this,
 having never ventured into the depths of "the Great Everwood"), three 
mighty green dragons dwell in the High Forest: the males Elaacrimalicros
 and Grimnoshtadrano, "the Riddling Dragon," and the female dragon 
Chloracridara. More about these three can be gleaned from the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i> and <i>The North</i> boxed set, and Grimnoshtadrano also appears in the novel <i>Elfsong</i> by Elaine Cunningham (TSR, Inc., 1994).</p>
