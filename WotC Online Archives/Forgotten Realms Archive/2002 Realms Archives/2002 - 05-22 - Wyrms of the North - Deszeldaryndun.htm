<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2005-22%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Deszeldaryndun_files/dragon_236_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">The
 pryings of Volo (polished somewhat by Elminster, whose eyebrows rose on
 more than one occasion on his first reading of them) bring us this time
 to one of the good dragons of the North: Deszeldaryndun Silverwing, the
 Guardian Wyrm of Everlund and consort to the seldom-seen Valamaradace 
(the Dragon Queen of Silverymoon).</p>
<p class="size2">Silverwing is sometimes called "the Kindly Dragon" in 
the lore of the North, because he so often aids humanoids. Though he 
avoids human society and politics, Silverwing seems fascinated by 
individuals. He has healed and sheltered many lost, lonely, or hurt 
folk.</p>
<p class="size2">Some have heard that Deszeldaryndun has participated in
 the adventures of those he has befriended. He prefers to do such things
 entirely in disguise, so those he helps are often unaware of his 
draconic nature. He does not hesitate, however, to reveal his true 
powers if such a tactic can help one of his chosen companions in need. 
He's also a shrewd judge of character. (Silverwing is very rarely duped 
or taken unawares.)</p>
<p class="size2">Silverwing is a sleek, graceful silver wyrm who seems 
to enjoy a slow-paced, simple life in the wilds, spiced with frequent 
human contact that he initiates or for which he sets his own terms. 
(Those he wishes to avoid simply cannot find him if they come looking.) 
The Guardian Wyrm spends much of his time in human shape in the forests 
west of Everlund, posing as a woodcutter going by such names as Ergoth 
Falaer or Drouth Sammart. His <i>ring of sustenance</i>, and the fungus 
caverns and stocked fish pools he has established, provide him with 
ample food. When he takes wing to hunt, it is to deal with beasts he 
wants removed from his chosen domain, not to meet the demands of hunger.</p>
<p class="size2">Though only veteran rangers active in the area may 
suspect that certain humans they meet with are in reality 
Deszeldaryndun, the Guardian Wyrm is famous in tavern-tales for tricking
 Zhentarim agents, members of the Arcane Brotherhood, Red Wizards, and 
other foes of law-abiding civilization in the North. He usually 
confounds such foes by approximating the shapes and mannerisms of 
powerful and influential persons (such as Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun 
and Elminster of Shadowdale) with uncanny precision. </p>
<p class="size2">Silverwing often impersonates Alustriel to allow her to
 slip away on covert (usually Harper or Chosen) business unnoticed, 
enhancing her reputation by allowing her to appear to be in two places 
at once or to respond to foes or crises with apparently blinding speed. 
On many occasions, he has deliberately taken her place in dangerous 
situations (including several <i>antimagic field</i>-laden ambushes 
intended to slay the High Lady of Silverymoon). Alustriel has kept such 
aid secret from all but her sons and certain fellow Chosen. Not even 
most senior Harpers know of it. The dragon renders such aid purely as a 
friend; although he approves of Alustriel's efforts to found a realm of 
relative safety and sophistication in the Moonlands of Luruar, 
Silverwing refuses to take any open part in the affairs of Alustriel's 
court, and he does not recognize that it has any authority over him (or 
his own Dragon Queen).</p>
<p class="size2">In return, Alustriel renders aid to both Silverwing and
 Valamaradace whenever they ask. The Lady of Silverymoon has prevented 
several dragon battles by appearing, ready to do battle, to surprise red
 dragons that have arrived to challenge Silverwing to combat. On one 
occasion, she posed as Silverwing's human slave in a ruse that allowed 
him to fool a dragon foe.</p>
<p class="h5">The veteran Harper Orbrind Hauthleather insists that the 
silent, cloaked swordsman who sometimes accompanies Alustriel in her 
palace and when she ventures outside the city is a shape assumed by some
 benevolent, powerful ally. Elminster confirms that the swordsman, who 
goes by the name of Talyn, is Silverwing's favorite human shape when he 
is with Alustriel. (His consort Valamaradace is known to favor an agile,
 diminutive, elven female human form and use the name of Targarda on her
 rare forays into civilized places.) Although Deszeldaryndun is a silver
 dragon and Valamaradace is a gold dragon, they're undeniably a couple, 
and all sources refer to Silverwing as Valamaradace's "consort." The 
Dragon Queen is rarely seen, but Deszeldaryndun often mingles with folk;
 he genuinely likes the company of intelligent, sensitive, good-aligned 
humans. Silverwing is an adult wyrm of graceful build and an abundant 
sense of humor. He has a natural talent for mimicry, and he specializes 
in the voices, movements, and mannerisms of humans and half-elves of 
both sexes.</p>
<p class="size2">Kindness is the defining, governing element of 
Deszeldaryndun's character, but he also has an impish sense of humor. 
This often shows itself in that he utters both sides of apparent 
"whispered conversations" to trick eavesdroppers into wild goose chases,
 precipitous actions, and spreading false rumors.</p>
<p class="size2">Silverwing personally enjoys gossip, learning secrets, 
and seeing the overall thrust and implications of all human activities 
in the Sword Coast North, but he enjoys a patience and self-control that
 no nosy human village busybody could hope to attain. Dragon Cultists 
and others who have tried to lure him into traps or revelations with the
 promise of rare or exclusive information have learned -- sometimes to 
their cost -- that Silverwing's interests never override his prudence 
and wry, wary grasp of perils around him.</p>
<p class="size2">An accomplished singer with a prodigious memory for old
 lyrics and obscure harmonies, Deszeldaryndun eagerly follows the 
careers and performances of both the famous and obscure bards and 
minstrels of Faerûn. One may often find him, in disguise, in fireside or
 tavern audiences, drinking in every intonation and gesture (for his own
 mimicry later). This habit has made him capable of perfectly aping the 
way certain musicians render songs.</p>
<p class="size2">Though he is a foe of pompous, humorless, or recklessly
 eager doers-of-good, Silverwing also likes and is entertained by the 
work of paladins, Harpers, and other positive agents in the Sword Coast 
North. He sometimes attaches himself to such individuals (and to less 
noble adventuring bands) as an uninvited, unannounced, and -- as much as
 he can manage -- unnoticed guardian and helper. Often when a warrior 
manages a "lucky escape," or a paladin prevails against impossible odds,
 the true cause is the watchful, unseen Guardian Wyrm of Everlund.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Deszeldaryndun's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Silverwing lairs with Valamaradace in the Floating 
Mountain, a gigantic, hollow oval rock whose uppermost surface rises 
into a ragged row of peaks or pinnacles. The spells of the Dragon Queen 
keep it aloft, enshroud it in mists, and allow her to direct it wherever
 she desires. Usually it hovers low over the woods due west of Everlund,
 or south of there on the verges of the High Forest. Most folk who see 
it through its mists think that they're looking at one of the distant 
Starspires or "Sisters" (peaks that rise at the heart of the High 
Forest, far to the south). Occasional glimpses of its true nature have 
won the flying rock its nickname.</p>
<p class="size2">The dragon couple refer to their floating rock abode as
 Softwing, which often confuses others who overhear them talking into 
thinking they're speaking the name of another dragon. (The secretive 
couple encourages such misunderstandings.) </p>
<p class="size2">Softwing has one huge central cavern opening that a 
dragon of Colossal size can glide into with wings fully spread, and many
 tiny, twisting passages that only Medium-size or smaller creatures can 
traverse. These lead to two small exits from the lair, one on the 
underside of the rock and one on its upper surface, and to a treasure 
cavern underlying the main one. The small exits are known as "the open 
doors," and the underside pair provides the favorite manner of exit from
 Softwing for both its inhabitants; they dive from an exit in human form
 and take dragon shape while plunging earthward.</p>
<p class="size2">Secret warding spells guard the cavern, but the magic 
veiling the open mouth of the main lair cavern includes some known 
spells, woven by Deszeldaryndun: <i>gentle breath</i>, which slows falling or flying creatures of even dragon size; <i>guardian trumpet</i>, an alarm spell that announces, highlights, and traces intruders; and <i>icy claw</i>, a defensive spell that harms and paralyzes certain chosen types of creatures who fail to elude or withstand it.</p>
<p class="size2">Softwing has many secrets as yet unrevealed. It is 
known, however, that a spell operating there allows both Deszeldaryndun 
and Valamaradace to generate multiple phantom images as the spell <i>project multiple images</i>. Such images primarily confuse intruders into attacking each other or wasting spells and missile weaponry on empty passages.</p>
<p class="h5">No friends or allies of the Dragon Queen and her consort 
have been invited to Softwing except Alustriel of Silverymoon. Both 
Elminster and Khelben, however, have independently investigated the 
place in beast shapes, emerging (so far as they know) undetected. The 
Blackstaff told his lady Laeral what he saw and spoke of feeling a 
"waiting, watching presence" in Softwing that maintains an alert and 
tireless vigil but conceals itself from both dragons. Knowing so little,
 he did not care to speculate on its nature and aims, but he found it 
"unsettling." Elminster detected no such lurking watcher. </p>
<p class="size2"><b> Deszeldaryndun's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From his lair in the Floating Mountain, Silverwing 
roams a territory whose borders are set (and patrolled) by his consort; 
in recent years they are roughly the entire Moonwood to the north, 
southeast to Sundabar and back southwest along the River Rauvin to 
Turlangtor (westernmost of the rocky heights that lie to the south of 
the river, and run east to Turnstone Pass). From there they plunge 
southwest into the Woods of Turlang to touch the Lost Peaks, and then 
run west along the Dessarin to a point south of Flint Rock, where they 
turn and run due north across the Evermoors to the River Surbrin, and 
thence along its banks back to the northern tip of the Moonwood again.</p>
<p class="size2">Although neither the Guardian Wyrm nor the Dragon Queen
 like to achieve prominence in the affairs of others in this area, it 
seems likely that their behind-the-scenes work and vigilance prevented 
the spread of the evil that resided for so long in Hellgate Keep, aided 
the treants of Turlang in withstanding the depredations of other 
creatures, and kept the trolls from arising in numbers enough on the 
moors to sweep humans out of the inland North. The two dragons prefer to
 bring about the mysterious "vanishing" of key foes; they dislike the 
open hunting and spreading of fear practiced by so many other dragons.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> The Deeds of Deszeldaryndun</b></p>
<p class="size2">The favorite prey of Silverwing, on those rare 
occasions when he does hunt in earnest, is the hippogriff. (He also 
likes horses and the deer of the High Forest.) In human form, 
Deszeldaryndun loves roasted almonds and cherry brandy. He likes to 
drink at several secluded pools in the Woods of Turlang, and once during
 a dry season he tore huge chunks of ice from the edge of the Endless 
Ice Sea and carried them south to feed his drying pools and make the 
forest green again.</p>
<p class="size2">The Guardian Wyrm spends most of his days wandering the
 woods west of Everlund, observing their endless panorama of life as he 
contemplates, uses spells to scry on distant individuals, and plans what
 to do next. He is especially fond of finding rare, strange, and 
beautiful things -- sights and deeds as well as flowers or other items 
-- to share with his Dragon Queen, and carries a spell -- <i>magic memory</i>
 -- that records things he sees in his mind for vivid sharing with her 
later. Thus, he can pass on to her the opening of a flower, the splendor
 of a sunset, or the touching valor of a deed performed by a human, 
sprite, or treant now dead.</p>
<p class="size2">How long Silverwing and his Queen have been together is
 not known by humans, though it is clearly more than a thousand years. 
Their love is deep and unshakeable -- both enjoy the freedom to pursue 
their own interests, friendships, and even love affairs among humanoids.
 They are capable of long-distance telepathy when necessary (probably 
through a permanent <i>Rary's telepathic bond</i>forged by Valamaradace with a <i>wish</i>) and admire each other even while they delightedly follow the doings of certain humans.</p>
<p class="size2">Neither Deszeldaryndun nor Valamaradace is interested 
in other dragons or even knows the names, breeds, and current deeds of 
neighboring wyrms. Neither has any known past or present alliances or 
matings with other dragons. They share similar attitudes toward other 
species (though Silverwing enjoys human contact far more than his Queen 
does) and nurture abiding hatreds only for the Cult of the Dragon and 
the dracoliches they've encountered.</p>
<p class="h5">Currently, Deszeldaryndun is working covertly to bring 
about a stable human realm in the North (that is, to aid Alustriel in 
establishing the land she dreams of, without being detected in his work)
 and to confound the agents of Thay, the Zhentarim, and the Dragon Cult 
who stray into the domain he shares with Valamaradace. </p>
<p class="size2"><b> Deszeldaryndun's Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">Silverwing is still vigorous and growing in power, but 
his selfless devotion to his Dragon Queen and his deep friendships with 
various lone humans in need of aid in the North are likely to bring 
about his eventual doom -- fighting against evil to defend the things he
 finds precious. As Elminster remarked, that's a fate to be proud of.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>As a standard action, 
Deszeldaryndun can breathe either a 60-foot cone of cold or a 60-foot 
cone of paralyzing gas. Once he breathes, he must wait 1d4 rounds before
 using either breath weapon again. The cone of cold deals 22d8 points of
 damage (Reflex save, DC 36, for half); the paralyzing gas paralyzes any
 creature within its area that fails a Reflex save (DC 36) for 1d6+11 
rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Crush:</b> When flying or jumping, Deszeldaryndun 
can land on opponents three or more size categories smaller than himself
 as a standard action, using his whole body to crush them. A crush 
attack affects as many creatures as can fit under his body. Each 
creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 36) or 
be pinned. If Deszeldaryndun chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a 
normal grapple attack (grapple bonus +63). Each pinned creature 
automatically takes 4d6+21 points of bludgeoning damage that round and 
each succeeding round that it remains pinned.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes 
effect automatically when Deszeldaryndun attacks, charges, or flies 
overhead. It affects only opponents within 330 feet of Deszeldaryndun 
and those with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the dragon. The affected 
creature must make a successful Will save (DC 37) or become shaken. 
Success indicates that the target is immune to the creature's frightful 
presence for one day. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice 
becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds, and one with 5 or more Hit Dice becomes
 shaken for 4d6 rounds. Deszeldaryndun is immune to the frightful 
presence of other dragons.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>3/day -- <i>control winds, fog cloud, polymorph self;</i> 2/day -- <i>feather fall;</i> 1/day -- <i>control weather. </i>Caster level 17th; save DC 20.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> Deszeldaryndun knows and casts spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep:</b> Deszeldaryndun can sweep his tail as
 a standard action. The sweep affects all creatures four or more size 
categories smaller than Deszeldaryndun within a half-circle with a 
diameter of 30 feet, centered on his rear. The sweep deals 2d6+21 points
 of damage (Reflex save DC 36 for half).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex): </b>Deszeldaryndun can ascertain 
his surroundings by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent but also 
by noticing vibration and other environmental clues) to a range of 330 
feet. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though he still can't 
discern ethereal beings. Deszeldaryndun usually does not need to make 
Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of his blindsight
 ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Cloudwalking (Su): </b>Deszeldaryndun can tread on 
clouds or fog as though on solid ground. This ability functions 
continuously but can be negated or resumed at will.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities: </b>Deszeldaryndun is immune to acid, cold, sleep, and paralysis.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Deszeldaryndun sees four times
 as well as a human under low-light conditions and twice as well in 
normal light. He also has darkvision with a range of 1,100 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Sorcerer Spells Known</i><b></b>(6/9/9/8/8/8/8/7/5; base DC = 20 + spell level): 0 <i>arcane mark, detect magic, ghost sound, light, mage hand, mending, open/close, prestidigitation, read magic; </i>1st <i>feather fall, jump, shield, Tenser's floating disk, ventriloquism;</i> 2nd <i>bull's strength, cat's grace, detect thoughts, protection from arrows, web; </i>3rd <i>dispel magic, gaseous form, lightning bolt, magic memory;</i> 4th <i>detect scrying, fire shield, shout, stoneskin; </i>5th<i>feeblemind, guardian trumpet, gentle breath, teleport;</i> 6th <i>control weather, legend lore, true seeing; </i>7th <i>greater scrying, limited wish, spell turning;</i> 8th <i>icy claw, project multiple images. </i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Languages:</i> Alzhedo, Chondathan, Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Illuskan, Netherese, Orcish.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i> Countless coins, gems, and art objects worth approximately 34,900 gp in total, 4 <i>beads of force</i>, a <i>harp of charming</i>, a <i>figurine of wondrous power</i> (<i>serpentine owl</i>), a <i>necklace of adaptation</i>, a <i>ring of sustenance</i>, a <i>ring of friend shield</i>
 (Valamaradace has the matching ring). At the DM's discretion, 
Deszeldaryndun's lair undoubtedly holds other items as well, as it is 
the shared home of the Guardian Wyrm and his consort, a great gold wyrm 
in her own right, and together they have a combined encounter level of 
28.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Deszeldaryndun's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2"> Silverwing isn't known for spectacular spells, but he 
can prepare and cast mighty spells that his Dragon Queen devises and 
passes on to him, and so his potential spell arsenal should never be 
underestimated. </p>
<p class="size2">On at least one occasion, the Guardian Wyrm dropped a 
"dead magic bomb" from aloft onto a party of magic-wielding foes: that 
is, a breakable container that unleashed a temporary <i>antimagic field</i> in a specific area upon breaking.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gentle Breath<br></b> Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> Cone<br><b>Duration:</b> 2 rounds/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Gentle breath</i> creates a cone-shaped cloud of 
pale, odorless, cloying vapors. Although the cone dissipates quickly, 
objects and creatures caught in its area suffer the effects for the 
duration of the spell.</p>
<p class="size2">The spell's first effect is similar to that of the <i>feather fall</i>
 spell and affects only free-falling objects and free-falling creatures.
 The rate of falling is instantly changed to 60 feet a round (equivalent
 to the end of a fall from a few feet), with no damage incurred upon 
landing while the spell remains in effect. However, when the spell 
duration ceases, a normal rate of fall resumes.</p>
<p class="size2">The spell's second effect is identical to that of the <i>slow</i> spell and affects only creatures (including flying and free-falling creatures). <i>Slowed</i>
 creatures can take only a partial action each turn. Additionally, they 
suffer -2 penalties to AC, melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and 
Reflex saves. <i>Slowed</i> creatures jump and pounce half as far as normal.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Haste</i> counters the <i>slow</i> effect, but not the <i>feather fall</i> effect.</p>
<p class="size2">Free-falling creatures are the only targets susceptible to both the <i>feather fall</i> and <i>slow</i>
 effects. A free-falling creature cannot choose to resist one of the 
spell's effects and not the other; one successful Will save negates both
 of the spell's effects. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Guardian Trumpet<br></b>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Area:</b> 25-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space (S)<br><b>Duration:</b> Permanent until discharged</p>
<p class="size2">As <i>alarm</i>, except it triggers both a mental and 
audible alarm. The audible alarm sounds like a trumpet, not a hand bell.
 The mental alarm can be heard anywhere on the same plane. You can 
deactivate or activate the <i>guardian trumpet</i> an unlimited number of times from within the protected area by uttering a secret word while within its confines.</p>
<p class="size2">A creature that triggers a <i>guardian trumpet</i> is bathed in <i>faerie fire</i> (as the 1st-level spell). Moreover, you can mentally sense the creature's exact location for as long as the <i>faerie fire</i> effect lasts, as the spell <i>locate creature</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Arcane Focus:</i> A tiny trumpet and a piece of very fine silver wire.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Icy Claw<br></b> Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 8<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 full round<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> 30-ft. radius spread<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You create a wraithlike, faintly glowing cloud of white
 vapors. The vapors coalesce into a visible, white, four-taloned claw of
 Medium-size whenever an intruder enters the spell's area. Multiple 
intruders generate multiple claws, one for each intruder. An "intruder" 
is any creature of one of three races or species chosen by you at the 
time of casting. You can choose one or two specific individuals of the 
selected races or species to be unaffected by the spell, but they must 
be present and touched by you during the casting of the spell. </p>
<p class="size2">An <i>icy claw</i> attacks once per round, and its 
attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier 
(for a wizard or sorcerer, respectively) +10 for the hand's Strength 
score (31). The <i>icy claw </i>deals 1d6+15 points of slashing damage plus 3d6 points of cold damage. </p>
<p class="size2"><i>Arcane Focus:</i> A glove fashioned from the hide of an ice toad.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Magic Memory<br></b>Divination [Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You and one other living creature<br><b>Duration:</b> Special<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">You absorb the sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and/or 
textures of your immediate environment and magically record them in your
 memory for as long as you concentrate (up to 1 round/level). Anything 
that causes you to break your concentration ends the record. You can 
later share your experience with another willing living creature simply 
by maintaining direct physical contact and letting the memory replay. 
For as long as contact is maintained, that creature's senses perceive 
the earlier recorded environment. Once the memory is replayed, the spell
 ends, and the memory becomes a normal memory for both you and the 
target.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Arcane Focus:</i> A mind flayer tentacle.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Project Multiple Images<br></b>Illusion (Shadow)<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 8<br><b>Effect:</b> 1d3+1 shadows</p>
<p class="size2">As <i>project image</i>, except you can create 1d3+1 
images, each image can act differently, and each image need not resemble
 you. You do not need to maintain a line of effect to each shadow, and 
you can cause each shadow to appear, disappear, or alter form as a free 
action.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Ed Greenwood, like his alter ego Elminster, is tall,
 bearded, untidy, pranksome and generally annoying -- but he freely 
admits it all.</i></p>
<p class="size2">Ed Greenwood works in a library in North York, Ontario,
 where he daily sees "people who ought to be in the Realms." So he 
writes novels -- and puts them there. (As to who's based on whom, he 
reminds us of the words of Khelben: "There are never prizes for piercing
 disguises.")</p>
<p class="size2">Ed Greenwood's <i>Wyrms of the North</i> column ran from <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine 230</i> through <i>259</i>, detailing over two dozen unique dragons of Faerûn. Although written for 2nd edition <b>AD&amp;D</b>,
 the original articles largely eschewed game statistics in favor of 
descriptive text, with the exception of the occasional spell or magic 
item. These articles will be reprised in a regular column on the Wizards
 of the Coast website with the addition of game statistics and updated 
spells and magic items for the new <b>D&amp;D</b>.</p>
