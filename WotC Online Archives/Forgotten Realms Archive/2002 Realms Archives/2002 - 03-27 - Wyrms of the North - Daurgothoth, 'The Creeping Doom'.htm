 The pryings of Volo (polished somewhat by Elminster, whose eyebrows 
rose on more than one occasion while reading them) bring us this time to
 something the Old Mage had intended to omit from this survey of 
powerful dragons of the North: a dracolich. So you're now reading 
something even Elminster decided to leave out of a book!</p>
<p class="size2">Why would one of the most powerful wizards in all Toril
 break his own rules now? Well, this undead wyrm bears watching. Not 
only is his influence quickly spreading, but the dracolich Daurgothoth 
is attempting to gain some abilities of other dragon types (he was 
originally a black wyrm) and to "come back to life" sufficiently to 
breed true and found his own new dragon species.</p>
<p class="size2">The twin obsessions of achieving personal supremacy and
 fathering a new race have kept Daurgothoth busy for over a century, 
improving his abilities however he can, and seeking a suitable mate -- 
or planning how to construct one, much as he's been modified in undeath.</p>
<p class="size2">The implications of Daurgothoth's fascinating endeavor 
are dark indeed. The only reason hordes of adventurers haven't descended
 on the dracolich, seeking his destruction, is that they don't know 
about him. Plenty of wild rumors are, however, spreading. . . .</p>
<p class="size2">Both Tolgar Anuvien and Malchor Harpell are 
(independently) beginning to uncover the location and activities of the 
undead wyrm, but the only folk who know the broad truth about the nature
 and aims of Daurgothoth are the Chosen of Mystra, powerful figures such
 as Elminster, Khelben, Laeral, and Alustriel. These archmages will not 
act or speak out against him, because the magical experimentation and 
advances Daurgothoth is making are precisely the sort of thing Divine 
Mystra encourages so that magic will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth is under no such restrictions and 
energetically seeks to slaughter any being who learns of his endeavors 
or who stumbles upon his lair. He has already slain no fewer than three 
bands of hired adventurers who were working for him in Waterdeep -- but 
whom he judged had begun to suspect too much about him. His spells allow
 him to speak with such underlings by means of projected (human-seeming)
 images and to spy upon them from afar. When doing so, Daurgothoth 
customarily poses as some sort of renegade, deliberately mysterious 
wizard.</p>
<p class="size2">In such roles, this dracolich has begun to play an 
increasingly active role in the shadier businesses of the cities of 
Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Secomber. At first, he 
pursued the acquisition of spells, magic items, and substances that 
might serve as magic components, but this drew the attention of too many
 alarmed spellcasters and authorities (one of whom dubbed the unknown 
cause of the thefts "the Creeping Doom," a title Daurgothoth gleefully 
adopted), so he has taken to cloaking his activities behind a web of 
often unwitting thieving bands and sharp-dealing gray market merchants.</p>
<p class="size2"> Once a great wyrm of considerable size, with a 
distinctive gouge in his left flank (an old, nearly mortal wound), 
Daurgothoth was transformed into a dracolich by the crazed Cult wizard 
Huulukharn. He promptly slew the wizard and vanished from the knowledge 
and influence of the Cult.</p>
<p class="size2">Today, the Creeping Doom possesses all the normal 
powers of a great black wyrm dracolich who is also a 20th-level wizard 
and 5th-level archmage (detailed in the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11836">Forgotten Realms</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11836"> Campaign Setting</a></i>,
 pages 41-42). Daurgothoth is known to be developing other breath weapon
 attacks -- in particular seeking to modify certain of his spells into 
this attack form. </p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth's phylactery is rumored to be a black opal 
of insignificant size, and it may be hidden in a huge heap of gems of 
all types and sizes that nearly fills a cavern that also holds the 
skeletal bodies of six lesser dragons that could serve him as a 
succession of replacement bodies. This cave is walled away behind 
tumbled rock somewhere under the gem-filled cavern of Daurgothoth's main
 lair. (The rock to be dug aside to reach it may well underlie the 
dracolich's bone pile itself.)</p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth is a brilliant crafter of magic, an 
eternally inquisitive being, and a practiced observer with an impressive
 memory. He is governed by a wary paranoia that keeps him always on the 
lookout for lurking foes and possible attacks, and that makes him work 
constantly to better his personal powers and defenses. This is one wyrm 
who will never be found with most or all of his spells exhausted. If he 
ever reaches such a state (in the heat of protracted battle), he swiftly
 departs, to hide away until his magic is again strong. He is patient in
 his dealings and calm in battle; none can successfully goad him, and 
pride never leads him into overconfidence in battle, or any stubborn 
refusal to retreat. For an immortal dracolich who takes care to 
safeguard himself from destruction, there will always be another day for
 fighting -- or for seeking revenge.</p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth has a cruel sense of humor and enjoys 
anticipating tactics ahead in any struggle. He craves music and company 
from time to time, but he never lets these needs compromise the security
 of his lair. Beautiful lady bards who acquire mysterious lone male 
human audiences at their campfires in the North are warned that they 
could be entertaining simple travelers, lycanthropes or doppelgangers, 
Harpers -- or the Creeping Doom. Daurgothoth seldom molests or devours 
good singers.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Daurgothoth's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Creeping Doom lairs in the abandoned gnome city of 
Dolblunde, which is north and east of Waterdeep. Known entrances to this
 subterranean labyrinth include the "Bandit Tunnels" in nearby Maiden's 
Tomb Tor, certain passages in the vast dungeon complex of Undermountain,
 and a flooded tunnel leading from the muddy bottom of the River 
Dessarin itself. This latter, largest route is the one most often used 
by Daurgothoth, though the dracolich does employ <i>teleport</i> spells 
on occasion. Daurgothoth's spells have hollowed out many large caverns 
for his convenience, forming an ever-growing chain that is tunneling 
slowly northwest, to a planned emergence shaft in the mountains north of
 Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2">To discourage intruders, the undead wyrm has placed 
many traps in the smaller gnome-created passages surrounding the great 
caverns of his lair. There are a few teeter-block pit traps of varying 
depths, but most of these perils are stone spikefall traps consisting of
 sharpened stones on dangle-chains suspended from the ceiling. These 
mechanical hazards are assisted by unswervingly loyal undead servitors 
-- deathfangs (detailed in <i>Races of Faerûn</i>), bone lurkers, and bonestings. The last are the wyrm's salvaged early attempts at creating a tail-sting.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spikefall Trap:</b> CR 1; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Atk +10 ranged (5d4/x2); Search (DC 20); Disable Device (DC 20). <i>Market Price:</i> 1,000 gp. <i>Note:</i> Damage applies only to those underneath the spikefall block.</p>
<p class="size2">At the heart of Daurgothoth's chain of caverns is a 
side passage large enough for a dragon to fly down. It is guarded by a 
wall of Large skeletons (the remains of a tribe of hill giants, still 
armed with their greatclubs) who have orders to attack all beings in the
 tunnel who aren't Daurgothoth himself. Above them hangs a death tyrant 
(an undead beholder detailed in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>, pages 309-310; its precious surviving eyestalk powers unknown) with similar orders.</p>
<p class="size2">Beyond these guardians, the tunnel leads to a closed 
stone door that is itself a stone golem that attacks anyone trying to 
open it. The door opens into a vast, ravaged cavern almost half a mile 
in length, its walls scorched and scarred, and its floor heaped with 
broken stone. This is the dracolich's spellcasting chamber, where he 
experiments with magic.</p>
<p class="size2"> A smaller tunnel leads off of one side of this cave, 
doubling back on itself several times, to reach the gem-filled cave 
where Daurgothoth sleeps and broods upon a huge pile of bones. Aside 
from the rumored secret, walled-away chamber that holds his host, two 
lesser caverns branch away from the main one: a treasure vault crammed 
with all manner of magic, statuettes, coins, and the like; and a storage
 room where the dragon keeps his spellbooks, the magic items he knows 
enough about to feel safe in using (just what these are remains a 
mystery), and a smooth-walled prison pit into which he drops living 
creatures he wants to keep for later. This pit is a smooth-walled (the 
stone walls fused into an almost glassy state by many applications of 
fiery breath and certain spells) shaft 30 feet across and 100 feet deep.
 The pit floor is damp sand, and lost in it is a <i>staff of the magi</i>
 (unknown to Daurgothoth). The dragon typically loops a rope around 
prisoners and tosses them down the shaft, securing the upper end of 
their pull-rope under a "lid" consisting of a huge, four-ton slab of 
stone that covers the top of the shaft. Dangerous prisoners (such as 
spellcasting adventurers) are encased in a set of <i>iron bands of Bilarro</i>
 first; this sphere lies ready in a hollow beside the shaft. Much of the
 rest of this storage cavern contains a vast collection of odd 
substances that might serve as material components, including the 
pickled corpses of such large monsters as dragon turtles, purple worms, 
and remorhaz (and, of course, several sorts of dragons).</p>
<p class="size2">In his main lair, Daurgothoth's massive bone pile 
affords him raw material for some bone-related attacks he is currently 
researching.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Daurgothoth's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From Dolblunde, Daurgothoth keeps watch over traffic on
 the High Road, the Long Road, and on the River Dessarin, as well as 
overland from the walls of Goldenfields south along the west bank of the
 Dessarin to Zundbridge, and north from there along the coast roughly as
 far as Mount Sar. He lacks the time to spy much in Waterdeep but 
employs a modified, long-range <i>wizard eye</i> spell for hours at a 
time to peer at things in the City of Splendors when he's interested in 
something (when word is abroad in the city about a wizardly duel, for 
instance, or the Watchful Order is gathering to discuss something 
important). Daurgothoth is interested in all things magical and in news 
of dragons and their doings. He's not, however, interested in being 
identified and located by nosy priests or wizards, and he seldom acts 
openly in his "territory."</p>
<p class="size2">One day, when his lair reaches to the surface somewhere
 in the mountains, he may fly forth each night to destroy any who dare 
to question his authority -- once his traps are ready to deal with the 
archmages who will inevitably try to destroy him. Soon, perhaps. . . .</p>
<p class="size2">In the meantime, Daurgothoth prefers to employ various 
unscrupulous minor wizards (including, notably, several Zhentarim 
wizards who fled the fall of Zhentil Keep) and adventuring bands. He 
keeps these forces believing they're working for a Waterdhavian noble 
who uses magic to conceal his identity and tries to keep each group of 
his agents ignorant of the existence of the others. Sometimes he tests 
their loyalty and mettle by sending various agents after the same thing,
 to see who prevails, how, and what they report to him about it.</p>
<p class="size2">These agents seize various magic items, spells, and 
substances that could serve in spellcasting. Daurgothoth often employs 
such aliases as "the Masked Master" or "Onalibar" when dealing with his 
underlings (the latter name is a private joke: it once belonged to a 
Cult wizard who tried to enslave the dracolich soon after his initial 
rebellion -- and who was promptly eaten for his pains). He rewards the 
wizards with useful spells from his collection, steering them into 
stealing or developing other magic for him in return.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Deeds of Daurgothoth</b></p>
<p class="size2">Freed of the need to hunt or consume any sort of food, 
Daurgothoth can pursue ever-greater magical achievements more or less 
constantly.</p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth tries to hide from other dracoliches and 
living dragons as much as possible, as well as from the annoyingly 
energetic members of the Cult of the Dragon. He has decided that if the 
latter organization proves to be too much of an annoyance, he will 
attempt to take over its leadership (concealing his true nature) and put
 it to work on his quest for the finding or making of a perfect mate.</p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth is especially wary of, and yet fascinated by, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/we/we20010330a">amethyst dragons</a>.
 He judges that their skills make them unpredictable and therefore 
dangerous, yet he also considers them possible sources for something 
that could be bred or modified into his mate. Studying the activities of
 the Cult of the Dragon and of wizards in general (while keeping well 
away from strongly organized groupings of wizards such as the Red 
Wizards of Thay or the archwizards of Halruaa) makes up much of his 
daily work. He's always considering schemes to improve the powers of any
 underlings or constructed servitor creatures to "snatch" newly 
developed magic from such sources undetected -- or at least in such a 
way that they can't reliably be followed. Often he ponders how he might 
control the mind of a scholar of Candlekeep well enough to learn things 
mind-to-mind and direct what books the individual read, while at the 
same time eluding the efforts of anyone searching for such a mind-link 
(which those in power in Candlekeep do regularly, as such infiltrations 
have been attempted so often in the recent past).</p>
<p class="size2">Daurgothoth's current activities include trying to 
infiltrate temples of Lathander to gain magic related to the creation of
 life (for his own breeding plans) and personally trying to develop a 
breath weapon that will act as a <i>Mordenkainen's disjunction</i> on everyone's magic but his. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Daurgothoth's Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Creeping Doom is so ambitious that his schemes seem
 destined to failure. Even Daurgothoth himself is aware that spawning a 
race of descendants having powers akin to his own could well be bringing
 on his own eventual doom (at their hands). Still, even if he never 
mates, his continual growth in power is a matter of grave concern for 
folk all over Faerûn, both draconic and human.</p>
<p class="size2">This dracolich will stop at nothing, and Mystra seems 
content to let him build himself into the greatest creature of magic in 
all Toril if he can achieve this aim. At the same time, his lonely 
search for a mate opens him to attack from wily foes, and if his 
capturing of magic grows more successful, he'll soon have no shortage of
 those.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Arcane Fire (Su):</b> Daurgothoth can channel arcane
 spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting as a bolt of raw magical 
energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (600 feet) 
that deals 5d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage per level of 
the spell channeled to create the effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Daurgothoth can breathe a 
120-foot line of acid that deals 24d4 points of acid damage (Reflex save
 DC 28 halves). Once he breathes, he must wait 1d4 rounds before he can 
do so again.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Control Undead</i> (Sp):</b> Once per 3 days, Daurgothoth can use <i>control undead</i> as a 15th-level sorcerer. He cannot cast other spells while this ability is in effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Paralyzing Gaze (Su): </b>The gaze of Daurgothoth's 
glowing eyes can paralyze each victim within 40 feet who fails a Will 
save (DC 34). If the save is successful, that creature is forever immune
 to Daurgothoth's gaze. If it fails, the victim is paralyzed for 2d6 
rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</b> A creature struck by any 
of Daurgothoth's physical attacks must make a Fort save (DC 34) or be 
paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. A successful saving throw against this effect 
does not confer any immunity against subsequent attacks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-like Abilities (Sp): </b>3/day -- <i>darkness</i> (120 feet), <i>insect plague; </i>1/day -- <i>plant growth.</i> Caster level 20th; save DC 16 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> In addition to his wizard spells, Daurgothoth knows and casts spells as a 15th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep:</b> Daurgothoth can sweep with his tail 
as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a diameter of
 30 feet, centered on his rear. Creatures within the area that are four 
or more size categories smaller than Daurgothoth are affected. The sweep
 deals 2d6+19 points of damage plus 1d6 points of cold damage plus 
paralyzing touch. An affected creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC 28)
 to take half damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Arcane Reach:</b> Daurgothoth can use touch spells 
on targets up to 30 feet away. If a spell requires a touch attack (melee
 or ranged), the archmage must make a ranged touch attack. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Daurgothoth can maneuver and 
fight by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing
 vibrations and other environmental clues). Invisibility and darkness 
are irrelevant, though he still can't discern ethereal beings. 
Daurgothoth's blindsight is effective to a range of 360 feet. He usually
 does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within 
range of his blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Charm Reptiles </i>(Sp): </b>Three times per day, Daurgothoth can produce an effect identical to that of a <i>mass charm</i> spell, except that it works only on reptilian animals. He can communicate with any charmed reptiles as though casting a <i>speak with animals</i> spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Corrupt Water</i> (Sp): </b>Once per day, 
Daurgothoth can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still,
 foul, and unable to support animal life. This ability spoils liquids 
containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a 
creature's possession must succeed at a Will save (DC 33) or become 
fouled.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dracolich Traits:</b> Daurgothoth is immune to cold,
 electricity, paralysis, polymorph, and sleep effects. Like a skeleton, 
he takes only half damage from piercing and slashing weapons. He has 
low-light vision.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Flight (Su):</b> Daurgothoth now flies without the aid of his bony wings.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Invulnerability:</b> If Daurgothoth is slain, his 
spirit immediately returns to its phylactery, a black opal of 
insignificant size. If there is no reptilian corpse within 90 feet for 
his spirit to possess, it is trapped within the phylactery until such a 
time that a corpse becomes available. If his spirit is in its 
phylactery, destroying that item when a suitable corpse is not within 
range effectively destroys him. Likewise, Daurgothoth is unable to 
attempt further possessions if his phylactery is destroyed. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Daurgothoth sees four times as
 well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal 
light. He also has darkvision (120-foot range).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Mastery of Elements:</b> Daurgothoth can alter an 
arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element from the 
one it normally does. This ability can alter only spells with the acid, 
cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptors. The spell's casting time 
is unaffected. Daurgothoth decides whether or not to alter the spell's 
energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins casting.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Mastery of Shaping: </b>Daurgothoth can alter area 
and effect spells that use the following categories: burst, cone, 
cylinder, emanation, or special. The alteration consists of creating 
spaces in the spell's area or effect that are not subject to the spell. 
The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, 
any shapeable (S) spells have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 
10 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell Power +1: </b>This ability increases the DC 
for the saving throws against Daurgothoth's arcane spells and caster 
level checks for his arcane spells to overcome spell resistance by +1 
(already included in save DCs below).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Undead Traits: </b>Daurgothoth is immune to poison, 
sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic 
effects, mind-influencing effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude 
save unless it also works on objects. He is not subject to critical 
hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. 
Negative energy heals him, and he is not at risk of death from massive 
damage but is destroyed at 0 hit points or less (but see invulnerability
 above). Daurgothoth cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if he
 is willing.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Water Breathing (Su):</b> Daurgothoth can breathe 
underwater indefinitely and can freely use his breath weapon, spells, 
and other abilities while submerged.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Daurgothoth's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Creeping Doom commands almost as wide an array of 
personally modified spells as do the Seven Sisters, or such mighty 
spellcasters as Elminster and Khelben Arunsun. This write-up could be 
filled several times over with them, but one deadly magic deserves 
mention because it is so spectacular. Also a variant on a common spell 
deserves mention because Daurgothoth so frequently employs it when 
dealing with other creatures:<b></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bonemelt<br></b> Necromancy<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 7<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> Special<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 day/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You transform the bones of a living, vertebrate 
creature to jelly. This spell has no effect on constructs, undead, 
plants, oozes, vermin, elemental, or aberrations.</p>
<p class="size2">If the target makes a successful Fortitude save, only 
one limb is affected (determine randomly, not including the head or 
tail, if any). The limb becomes a dangling, jelly-like mass lacking the 
strength to hold or carry things. If the limb is used for locomotion 
(for example, a leg), the target's speed drops by three-quarters and 
Dexterity suffers a -8 circumstance penalty. If the limb is used for 
manipulation (for example, an arm), the target's Dexterity suffers a -8 
circumstance penalty and all spellcasting requires a Concentration check
 (minimum DC 15). Held items are dropped, but worn items are not 
dropped.</p>
<p class="size2">If the target fails his Fortitude save, the victim 
collapses (at the end of his next action) into a helpless, amoeba-like 
slithering blob. Breathing and movement by creeping (speed 10 feet) is 
possible, but climbing, flying, wielding items, and the like becomes 
impossible. Death won't directly occur from this alteration but it often
 results from the lack of swift mobility the spell causes. </p>
<p class="size2">After failing his initial saving throw, the target of 
this spell can make an additional Fortitude save every 24 hours. If he 
succeeds, his form changes to the same state as if he had saved against 
the spell originally.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Project Alternate Image<br></b> Illusion (Shadow)<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 7<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> One shadow image<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will disbelief (if interacted with)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">As <i>project image</i>, except the shadow image can have the form of any creature, including your own, as visualized by you while casting.</p>

<p class="size2">Bone monsters are undead creatures assembled from the 
bones of fallen creatures and knitted together with necromantic magic. 
They are mindless automatons that obey the orders of their evil masters.
 If destroyed, they collapse into piles of unconnected bones.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bone Lurker</b></p>
<p class="size2">These undead creatures appear as portcullises or 
gridwork-curtains created from interlaced human and beast bones adorned 
with sharp bone spurs.</p>
<p class="size2">A bone lurker can be created by means of an <i>animate dead</i> spell, and it requires three corpses to create one bone lurker. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2"> A bone lurker attacks by dropping onto its prey and 
wrapping itself around its victim. Dropping down in this fashion is 
considered a charge attack from higher ground. A bone lurker that misses
 its initial attack often flies up and tries to drop on the opponent 
again.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Constrict (Ex): </b>A bone lurker deals 1d8+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If the bone lurker hits an 
opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with its
 slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a
 free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus 
+10). The bone lurker has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or
 simply use its body to hold the opponent. Either way, each successful 
grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam
 damage and constrict damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Paralysis (Ex): </b>Any creature hit by a bone lurker's slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 11) or be paralyzed for 1d6+2 minutes.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities (Ex):</b> Bone lurkers have cold 
immunity. Because they lack flesh or internal organs, they take only 
half damage from piercing or slashing weapons.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Undead Traits:</b> Immune to poison, sleep, 
paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, 
mind-influencing effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects; not subject to critical hits, subdual 
damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain; cannot heal 
damage if there is no Intelligence score, (though fast healing and 
regeneration work normally); negative energy heals; not at risk of death
 from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less; darkvision 
60 ft.; cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is 
willing.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills: </b>A bone lurker gains skills as a construct.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bonesting</b></p>
<p class="size2"> These undead creatures appear as great snakelike 
assemblies of bone that are fixed to the wall, ceiling, or floor at one 
end. They have a length of 8 to 16 feet when fully uncoiled, and they 
have a thickness of about 1 foot.</p>
<p class="size2">A bonesting can be created by means of an<i> animate dead </i>spell, and it requires two corpses to create one bonesting. </p>
<p class="size2"><b> Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A bonesting attacks by coiling and lashing out from its
 anchor point. It slashes or stabs foes with a bone "swordspike" as long
 as some men stand tall. If severed from its anchor point, a bonesting 
is destroyed.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Swordspike (Ex): </b>The "tail" of a bonesting is known as a swordspike. This natural weapon inflicts slashing damage (crit 19-20).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wounding (Su):</b> Damage from a swordspike bleeds 
for 1 point of damage per round after dealing initial damage. Multiple 
wounds from a swordspike result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds 
for 2 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be 
stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 15) or the application of 
any <i>cure</i> spell or other healing spell (<i>heal, healing circle,</i> and so on). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities (Ex):</b> Bonestings have cold immunity. 
Because they lack flesh or internal organs, they take only half damage 
from piercing or slashing weapons.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Undead Traits:</b> Immune to poison, sleep, 
paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, 
mind-influencing effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects; not subject to critical hits, subdual 
damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain; cannot heal 
damage if there is no Intelligence score, (though fast healing and 
regeneration work normally); negative energy heals; not at risk of death
 from massive damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less; darkvision 
60 ft.; cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is 
willing.</p>
