 of the dragons of the North that puzzles Volo most is Galadaeros, a 
copper dragon often seen in the sky flying low but fast across the Sword
 Coast North -- and usually bearing several riders on his back. When 
such dragonriders can be seen clearly, they are almost always human 
females in ornate armor, bristling with weapons and looking eager to use
 them. Elminster supplied secrets that Volo could only guess at (wildly 
and, as it turns out, wrongly), and so lay clear the unusual career of 
Galadaeros, the Sunset Flame or, less formally, the Flame Dragon. This 
latter nickname has confused many sages, who think it refers to a red 
dragon or other wyrm who breathes fire, whereas it was in truth bestowed
 on Galadaeros by Launchalo Rivryn, an otherwise forgotten Waterdhavian 
poet who was striving to describe the dragon's appearance as Galadaeros 
flew into the city across the Sea of Swords and out of the setting sun. </p>
<p class="size2">Galadaeros is a mature adult male copper dragon of 
unusually gentle and humorous character; the pride that so dominates his
 breed seems almost entirely lacking in his manner. He dwells alone in a
 mountaintop cavern, on a nameless, uncharted island in the Sea of 
Swords northwest of Gundarlun. This island is generally considered by 
those who see it to be one of the Purple Rocks. Regardless, the Sunset 
Flame is seldom at home. Galadaeros was visited in his lair 300 years 
ago by the Waterdhavian adventurer Ranressa Shiard, who preferred to 
seek her fortune in the company of other women. Ranressa was the last of
 an all-female adventuring band, the Shining Ring Swordshars, to survive
 a wild ocean voyage that ended in a shipwreck on the rocks of the 
dragon's island. "Bold" was her watchword and driving spirit; after 
hauling herself ashore, she set about exploring the isle. When she found
 Galadaeros, she promptly tried to slay him. Amused by her dogged yet 
futile attempts to bring about his doom, the lonely copper dragon chose 
to question Ranressa rather than destroy her, and eventually a 
friendship developed. This companionship led to the dragon taking 
Ranressa back to Waterdeep on his back. Her triumphal flight into the 
city made Ranressa an instant hero -- after the citizenry recovered from
 the sight of Galadaeros wheeling over the Palace to alight on Mount 
Waterdeep, which is a flourish that caused much consternation in the 
streets (and the hasty crafting of magical wards that, according to 
Khelben Arunsun, prevent most dragons from doing such things today). </p>
<p class="size2">Ranressa promptly chartered the all-female Galadran 
Company, who took ship 68 strong the next summer, to revisit her friend.
 All of the Galadrans (who were known rather less politely in the 
taverns of Waterdeep as "Sharptongues") were Waterdhavian ladies of 
gentle or noble birth who desired to be adventurers. Galadaeros was 
delighted to acquire such friends, and he adopted them as his own brood,
 inquiring as to their health, mating plans, and goals in life with the 
manner of a kindly old uncle. He also served as their steed as they set 
out to discover adventure in the North. Waterdeep soon dismissed the 
Galadran Company as a band of crazed young lasses out for a fling 
(though lady minstrels and young girls playing in the streets find them 
harder to forget), but Galadaeros can still pass the magical city wards 
freely and bring his young comrades home to their villa on the seaward 
side of Mount Waterdeep. When the Sunset Flame wheels low over the 
streets, it is a sign of celebration among his riders. </p>
<p class="size2">This is not to say that the career of the Galadran 
Company has been one long sun-drenched pleasure outing. Ranressa proved a
 tirelessly bold -- some might even say reckless -- leader, and she grew
 restless when evil mages whose towers dripped treasure from every 
window and turret seemed hard to find, marauding orcs proved to have 
empty belt-purses, and the lairs of great wyrms turned out to house 
dragons who were far less friendly than Galadaeros. Ranressa led her 
fellow adventurers on wilder and ever more daring exploits. The Sunset 
Flame had to effect several hasty rescues in that first season, and one 
or two in later years. During those seasons, fully half of the romantic 
but unskilled Galadran ladies perished messily in various misadventures.
 The remainder slowly became competent warriors, and one named Lhaerilda
 made a fortuitous discovery in the Crags while the Galadrans were 
sneaking up on an orc encampment: A rockslide had laid bare one chamber 
of an ancient underground dwarven tomb that was literally crammed to the
 ceiling with gold. Galadaeros flew it all out to his island for the 
Galadrans, and he gave over a side-cavern of his lair for their 
treasury. In return, they gave him a triple share of the staggering 
wealth; Ranressa judged the gold to total over thrice the dragon's body 
volume. The Galadran Company promptly acquired houses in Waterdeep, a 
fantastic array of impressive-looking armor (some of it almost useless 
in battle), and finally the respect they craved. There have, however, 
been no more tremendous discoveries of treasure in the years since, and 
news of the great Galadran wealth has drawn more than a few foes to come
 calling on the Galadrans.</p>
<p class="size2">The mage Nuldus of Turtorn (a ruin northeast of 
Conyberry), for example, enslaved several of the Galadrans with his 
spells, hoping to bring the entire band under his mental sway and thus 
lay his hands on their treasure. He got as far as crafting amulets that 
allowed him to speak mind-to-mind over great distances with those who 
wore them, then he sent his slaves back to their companions with orders 
to slay Ranressa and the dragon. They failed, and Galadaeros dove out of
 the sky one morning and smashed the mage's small tower to the ground, 
killing Nuldus. The Galadrans salvaged some magic from the rubble, and 
they retained the amulets. Today these magic pendants allow six of the 
lady adventurers to communicate at will with each other and the copper 
dragon -- who can now be summoned from his isle when needed.</p>
<p class="size2">The Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan sent several of its 
ambitious apprentices out on separate missions to "prove themselves" by 
seizing what they could of the Galadran treasury. One after another 
found death rather than success -- though the apprentice Indratril 
Khalshus slew no fewer than eight Galadrans before Galadaeros tore her 
apart, and the apprentice Rythimm Hardrost killed two of the lady 
adventurers and did snatch up a fistful of rubies (which were lost into 
the sea at his death) before being run through by the swords of six 
Galadrans at once.</p>
<p class="size2">An unsuccessful company of adventurers, Falder's 
Flourish, left Waterdeep vowing to slay Galadaeros "and his ungodly 
harem of sword-ladies," but they were drowned by a dragon turtle before 
they ever reached the isle Galadaeros calls home. However, two Galadrans
 have since been slain in Waterdeep by stealth, on two separate 
occasions, by intruders lurking -- perhaps covertly dwelling -- in 
Galadran houses. Taunting messages left beside the bodies indicate that 
the killers were surviving members of the Flourish, bent on "undying 
revenge." Whether this recurring phrase indicates that the Flourish 
slayers are undead is not yet known, but they have utterly eluded at 
least one magically-aided attempt to trace them.</p>
<p class="size2">The Galadran Company continues undaunted in the face of
 these and many more minor attacks and attempts to rob them. Some of 
their Waterdhavian homes have even been fitted with nasty falling-floor 
traps that dump intruders into greased shafts. Victims plunge down these
 ever-narrower chutes until they become wedged. There they can be 
hoisted out as captives, or just left in the walls to die. Other 
Galadran abodes sport overhead coal-scuttles full of boulders, which a 
retreating resident can pull down on the heads of pursuers by jerking on
 certain bell-pulls. Wise opponents of the warrior-women don't bother to
 dare the trapped rooms and passages of a Galadran house; the lady 
adventurers they seek are almost always on the island where the 
Company's dragon lairs -- and all substantial Galadran treasures are 
stored there. </p>
<p class="size2">Though his lair often rings with the clash of swords or
 the laughter of the ladies who wield them, Galadaeros never seems to 
tire of all the human activity around him. He has, however, been 
saddened by the infirmity and death of one aged adventurer after another
 (Ranressa, in particular), and he was enraged when some men brought to 
his isle by the Galadrans to be their husbands conspired to make a crude
 boat and try to steal off with as much of the treasure as it could hold
 -- he sank them when they were well out to sea. Other mates have proved
 more trustworthy, though the Galadrans now tend to rear healthy babes 
on the isle and sickly babes in Waterdeep, and they keep all husbands 
and consorts on the mainland. As the years have passed, all of the 
original Galadrans have died, and the strength of the Company has 
dwindled to between 20 and 30 members. Of these, seven (five of them 
current holders of the amulets) are descendants of founding Company 
members. </p>
<p class="size2">The unofficial but unquestioned leader of the Company 
today is the warrior Emra Ilchantra, whose close companion and 
second-in-command is the sorceress Aszyra Thunderstaff (of the 
Waterdhavian noble family, though you will wait in vain to hear any of 
them speak of her; they seem to have disowned her thanks to the "low" 
reputation of adventurers in general). Aszyra is judged to be "of 
middling powers" in her magecraft. The other amulet-holders, aside from 
the aformentioned Galadrans and Galadaeros himself, are the warriors 
Glyndra Rowandar, Jhandanna Orwynd, and Khalaltae Baerdrith, and the 
fiery-haired and tempered Lokkara Arsalan (the sole amulet-holder not 
descended from a company founder). The last two descendants of founding 
Company members, Ybril Harlundtree and Aurbreena Gathengate, have no 
desire or capacity for leadership. Ybril (pronounced "Eee-bril"), a 
priestess of Ilmater, serves as the Company's surgeon and healer; and 
Aurbreena sees to Company provisions, gear, and stores, and she keeps a 
rough diary of Galadran deeds and decisions. </p>
<p class="size2">A series of deaths and reversals in the Company some 20
 summers ago led the Galadrans to add legitimate, stable business 
ventures to their adventuring lives, and today the Company provides 
short-term, high-risk bodyguard services to fearful (and wealthy) 
clients, and provides "secure hideaway banking and storage" facilities 
to Waterdhavians and citizens of Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Valuable
 items -- even, on one occasion, an endangered noble heir -- are 
conveyed to the dragon's isle and there stored in side-tunnels of his 
lair, secure behind boulders only the dragon can move. The Galadrans 
have ignored many business proposals involving their dragon for two 
reasons: they defer to Galadaeros in such matters, and he seems 
uninterested; and they fear Cult of the Dragon agents will try to lure 
the Sunset Flame into a trap. They are currently considering three 
separate requests from Waterdhavian noble families to take on daughters 
as short-term Company members, both to win treasure and to taste 
adventure. </p>
<p class="size2">Galadaeros has made it clear that although he has no 
objection to ferrying Company members back and forth across the North, 
he is not eager to become any sort of aerial-steed-for-hire -- and the 
Galadrans are in full agreement. The one such commission the Company did
 accept, some years back, turned out to be from a wizard who tried to 
get the Sunset Flame to destroy the home of a rival mage by deceiving 
the dragon as to who owned the house. Galadaeros and two Galadrans found
 themselves in the midst of a wild spellbattle that ended only after 
Galadaeros swept past the turrets of the house and scraped the wizard 
(one Mrathatos Druin, pretending to be a scribe from lriaebor by the 
name of "Namarathos Alonabryn") on his back into bloody ruin. The 
Galadrans were badly hurt by that desperate aerobatic, and the wizard 
whose house was assaulted, Halynder Uinsible, still regards the Company 
as his foes. </p>
<p class="size2">This is not to say that the dragon and the Galadrans 
are adverse to new business ventures; in fact, they've charged their 
three city agents with the task of identifying new business ventures 
that the Company can undertake. Bruth Melber is the Company's agent in 
Waterdeep. This careful, balding, middle-aged longtime diplomat has been
 active in the City of Splendors all his life, and although some can 
recall his rather colorful past as a swindler and later envoy for shady 
principals and shadier causes, he is glad to have found an employer to 
see him through his graying years, and he is steadfastly loyal to the 
Galadrans.In a house behind his office on the Sutherlane, Bruth 
maintains sleeping quarters for Company members visiting the city on 
business.</p>
<p class="size2">A many-balconied, tall, and narrow house on Eel Street 
is home to "Mother" Mounchathos, who is the fat, bustling Galadran agent
 in Baldur's Gate. This kindly matron never seems tired and can be seen 
at all hours chattering excitedly to sleepy-looking servants as she 
crashes and dashes around her abode, seeing to the cooking and the 
cleaning and the troubles and aspirations of a hundred Baldurians who 
regard her as their true mother and would do anything for her. Mother 
Mounchathos runs a bakery, a shop that sells yarn and needles and bolts 
of fine cloth from the South (along with free advice and demonstrations 
on how to turn these into stylish garments), and a soup-window. She 
sells "hot pots" of soup to merchants and others who must eat on the 
run; a young boy doles out copper piece deposits for the return of all 
empty pots, with another copper if their lids come back, and a third 
copper if the ladles make it home, too. In the odd moments all these 
activities leave to her, Mounchathos acts as a messenger and go-between 
for folk who need an all-female adventuring company to right wrongs -- 
or just to appear in a parade. </p>
<p class="size2">One rich merchant of Amn hires the Galadrans every year
 to add an element of dangerous beauty to his revelries. This fat, 
prancing little man of many eager enthusiasms and squeals of boundless 
energy, by the name of Veloudamar Ralanshalass, hungers more than 
anything else for respect. Each year the little merchant throws a party 
to impress his clients -- and after there's been much dining, drinking, 
and dancing, curtains are rolled back to display Galadran warriors 
reclining in wild armor and outlandish costumes while the little man 
struts up and down declaiming their skills. A few breaths later, the 
curtains are firmly tied shut, and the Galadrans accept 100 gold pieces 
each from silent servants and take wing on Galadaeros! </p>
<p class="size2">The Galadran agent in Neverwinter is a quiet, always 
calm man named Alasturan Malatheer. He runs a shop on Hindalos Street 
where he sells maps, charts, and floorplans of castles, mansions, lands,
 and seas of Faerûn. Some adventurers mutter that some of the maps 
they've bought from Alasturan seem to owe more to his imagination than 
to reality in Faerûn, but there are rumors that folk who threatened this
 quiet shopkeeper found themselves facing a sudden onslaught of monsters
 and magic items that Alasturan seemed able to control in concert. Some 
say he's a retired adventurer, and others claim he's a wizard in hiding 
from some deadly sorcerous foe. Folk in Neverwinter most like to tell a 
tale that the mapseller denies: Once, when a copper dragon flew into the
 city with one ragged and torn wing weeping great tears of blood, 
Alasturan rose up into the form of a great gold dragon and cradled the 
wounded dragon to his breast, flying westward out to sea with his great 
golden wings carrying them both. Probably only Alasturan and Galadaeros 
(who personally chose the Galadran agent in Neverwinter) know the true 
nature and powers of the unassuming mapseller; Elminster refuses to do 
more than smilingly muse about what a formidable foe a song dragon 
wizard who retained his magecraft in gold dragon form would be -- and 
then add enigmatically that Mystra would almost have to take a personal 
interest in such an individual. </p>
<p class="size2"> On the subject of Galadaeros himself, Elminster was 
more forthcoming. The Company of striving, loving humans has become the 
dragon's family, banishing his loneliness and making him feel loved, 
revered, and needed for the first time in his life. It is more precious 
to him than treasure, dominance, and indeed anything else. So long as he
 can eat and find a safe place to rest from time to time, Galadaeros is 
happy to be a part of this noisy, reckless, fun-loving band of human 
women, with their wild plans and daring deeds; he is a young and playful
 wyrm at heart so long as he can be a part of this endless revel of 
human energy and ambition -- and the Sunset Flame takes delight in such 
simple acts as sliding softly past the windows of Waterdhavian nobility 
to pluck his Galadran ladies from a balcony in midrevel and hearing the 
gasps, oaths, and screams of awed nobles from all sides. Galadaeros 
seems to lack both the pride of his kind and the insensitivity that goes
 with it, but his most special talent is an uncanny ability he's 
developed over the years to judge the needs and schemes of humans. He's 
familiar with the North (and all of the Sword Coast from the Nelanther 
north to where the "undying ice" begins) and can find his way unerringly
 about in the worst snowstorms and other heavy weather. He also 
possesses some modest skill at magic. </p>
<p class="size2">Galadaeros happily spends his days acting as the steed,
 heavy reinforcement, and wise old advisor to the Company. His 
relationships with other dragons have been, in the words of the human 
sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate (fast becoming recognized as an authority
 on the history of dragons up and down the Sword Coast), "polite but 
brief and casual encounters; he offers no menace but in turn ignores it 
when offered to him -- and then removes himself while the other wyrm is 
still lost in puzzlement." The key to understanding Galadaeros could be 
said to be recognition of his deep and discerning sensitivity to the 
characters of others -- human females in particular. He has few known 
foes, but the Cult of the Dragon is most definitely among them.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> The Lair of Galadaeros </b></p>
<p class="size2">The Sunset Flame makes his lair in a network of caverns
 in the heart of the highest peak (a modest mountain by the standards of
 Faerûn, being a mere pinnacle rising out of high moors) on the island 
that he styles Flamehome (most of the Galadrans call it "Galadros" or 
"the Dragon's Isle"). The caverns are said to be warmed by volcanic 
vents at their lowest levels, and to stretch for miles, with many 
chambers large enough to hold Galadaeros comfortably, though he can 
spread his wings and glide to a landing or surge into flight in only a 
handful of them. </p>
<p class="size2">The Flame Dragon has at least three entrances to his 
lair, and he is said by some Galadrans to have three wizshades as 
servants, though others suspect these seldom-seen sorcerers are wild 
mages who visit him rarely -- or even some of the Seven Sisters. 
Elminster says that all three conjectures are wrong, but that the last 
one comes closest. Of other servants, there have been no signs -- beyond
 the dragon's obvious use of <i>unseen servant</i> spells. </p>
<p class="size2"><b> The Domain of Galadaeros</b></p>
<p class="size2">From Flamehome, Galadaeros roams the waters in a wide 
circle that takes in the Purple Rocks. On at least three occasions, he 
has savagely attacked and driven away dragons who tried to make their 
lairs amid the isles of the Rocks. When a marauding black dragon of 
gigantic size attacked, Galadaeros slew her by driving her down into the
 sea and crushing her throat while she struggled in the cold depths. 
Beyond this rather modest territory, Galadaeros makes no claims -- but 
he also seems to consider himself exempt from the territorial claims of 
all other dragons, flying where he wills and (whenever possible) 
ignoring or avoiding battle with the wyrms he thus arouses. </p>
<p class="size2"><b> The Deeds of Galadaeros </b></p>
<p class="size2">The favorite prey of Galadaeros are the mountain goats 
and rothé that roam the Purple Rocks and the "Cold Coast" (that part of 
the mainland coast north of Mirabar), but he is apt to devour creatures 
-- even livestock -- and drink from handy lakes and rivers wherever he 
finds them when ranging far and wide across the Sword Coast North on 
Company business. Outside of his time with the Galadran Company, 
Galadaeros is known to have gone on solitary flights exploring the 
northlands, but these have become rare in recent years. He has engaged 
in no known alliances or matings with other dragons (beyond whatever 
draconic element his relationship with Alasturan of Neverwinter may 
involve). </p>
<p class="size2"><b> The Fate of Galadaeros</b></p>
<p class="size2">Those who go adventuring are apt to die by 
misadventure, as the old saying goes -- and that's as likely to be true 
for Galadaeros as it is for a human swordswinger; over the years, he's 
intruded on enough dragon territories, and swooped past enough Cult of 
the Dragon agents, to be widely noticed.</p>
<p class="size2">That would make him target enough for ambitious young 
dragons, even without his Company service -- which is all too apt to 
draw him screaming into deadly combat situations in attempts to rescue 
Galadran ladies from various dooms. Any attack on a Company member could
 well be intended as a lure deliberately to draw the Sunset Flame into a
 deadly trap -- and more than one cabal in Waterdeep has tried just that
 over the years (along with the Arcane Brotherhood, agents of the Cult 
of the Dragon, and even servants of a Red Wizard of Thay who hoped to 
enslave Galadaeros to his will). All such attempts thus far have been 
failures, but sooner or later one will inevitably succeed, unless (as 
Elminster hinted a time or two) Galadaeros has formidable magic or 
allies he can call upon in times of need. </p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Galadaeros can breath a 100 
ft. line of acid that deals 14d4 points of damage (Reflex save DC 25 
half). Once he has breathed, he must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so 
again.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Galadaeros can breathe a 50 ft. cone of <i>slow</i> gas (Will DC 25 negates). Any creature in the area that fails its save functions as though under the effect of a <i>slow</i> spell for 1d6+7 rounds. Once Galadaeros has breathed, he must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes 
effect automatically when Galadaeros attacks, charges, or flies 
overhead. It affects only opponents within 210 feet and with 6 or fewer 
Hit Dice or levels. The affected creature must make a successful Will 
save (DC 25) or become panicked (if 4 or fewer HD) or shaken (if more 
than 5 HD). Success indicates that the target is immune to Galadaeros's

<p class="size2"><b>The Magic of Galadaeros </b></p>
<p class="size2">Little is said of the magic of Galadaeros, beyond an 
oft-repeated tale about his once hurling a spell that released a handful
 of live firetails (a creature similar to a flamebrother salamander), 
and he seems to employ magic to do useful things, rather than as 
spectacular attacks or for foe-impressing effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scalespurs<br></b> Evocation [Force]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Effect:</b> Up to 32 handles of force on your body<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)</p>
<p class="size2">You create a number of semicircular handles of force 
equal to your height or length in feet. These handles have a radius of 1
 foot and emerge from any part of your body you desire. They are 
attached to you as firmly as your own limbs and cause you no discomfort 
(although excess weight or force applied to one of the handles can 
injure you if it that weight or force would harm one of your normal 
limbs).</p>
<p class="size2">Galadaeros developed this spell to help Galadrans 
riding him to stay on even in the middle of combat. Normally riders 
tether themselves to the handles with harnesses and also hold on with 
their hands. A person merely holding onto the bars is treated as if on a
 military saddle (+2 bonus on all Ride checks related to staying 
mounted). A person strapped in cannot fall off the mount unless the 
straps are untied or cut (a move-equivalent action).</p>
<p class="size2">The handles cannot be used to make attacks, even 
against ethereal or incorporeal creatures, nor do they provide you any 
defense. A person lying flat between two handles has up to one-half 
cover.</p>
<p class="size2">Grapple checks made against you while the handles are present get a +5 circumstance bonus.</p>
<p class="size2">The handles are not subject to <i>dispel magic</i> but are destroyed by <i>disintegrate</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">The spell gets its name from an earlier version that 
actually grew spurs from the dragon's scale, but he found that the spurs
 caused more damage to himself than to any foe, so he altered the spell 
to its current version.<b></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Talonsnatch<br></b> Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 4<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Duration:</b> 2 rounds<br><b>Target:</b> 1 creature<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You draw a single creature of up to 25 pounds per 
caster level toward you by a powerful telekinetic burst. This has one of
 two effects: an instant mounting or an instant snatch.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Instant Mounting:</i> The target lands on your back 
safely in a position suitable for riding. Movement in this manner 
provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures (other than you) whose 
threatened area the target passes through. If you are a creature that 
normally can function as a mount (such as a horse, pony, riding dog, or 
dragon), you are now the target's mount. Otherwise, the creature you 
pull toward you can immediately attempt to grapple you as an attack of 
opportunity.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Instant Snatch:</i> The creature is dragged into 
your open hand (or claw, if you have claws instead of hands). The 
creature stops in any square of your choice that is within your 
threatened range. Movement in this manner provokes attacks of 
opportunity from creatures (other than you) whose threatened area the 
target passes through. You deal claw damage to the target and can 
immediately attempt to start a grapple as if you had the Snatch feat.</p>
<p class="size2">Galadaeros often uses this spell to pluck Galadran 
ladies aloft from areas to which he can't fly close enough to reach 
safely with an actual talon.</p>
