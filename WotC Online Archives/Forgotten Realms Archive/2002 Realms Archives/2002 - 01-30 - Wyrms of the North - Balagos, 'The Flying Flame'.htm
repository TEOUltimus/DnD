<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2001-30%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Balagos,%20%27The%20Flying%20Flame%27_files/dragon_232_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">The
 survey of dragon rulers of the North conducted by the notorious Volo 
(and corrected by Elminster) continues with one of the most famous 
dragons in all Faerûn: Balagos, the Flying Flame. This great red wyrm is
 legendary for his gigantic size and temper, and for the spells he hurls
 so often and recklessly in his boisterous, brawling rise to supremacy 
(he intends) over all Faerûnian dragonkind. Balagos acts like a much 
younger dragon, betraying neither weakness nor loss of fire and showing 
wisdom only in his avoidance of well-prepared mages who come looking for
 him. He strikes hard and unexpectedly, and he has slain so many other 
dragons that the elves dubbed him "Dragonbane."</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos is Ulla Bahor in the tongue of the gnoll. 
Shortened to Bahor, this name has passed into wider use among the 
humans. Whatever he is called, this giant dragon is a fearsome foe who 
delights in slaughtering adventurers, wizards, and dragons alike. He has
 been the death of the Company of the Firestar (based in Esmeltaran), 
the Company of the Coin (out of Amnwater), the Laughing Lynx Long-haul 
Caravan Company of Riatavin, the wizards of the Tower of Tyruld east of 
Keshla, and the entire seven-ship Silver Swords Boarding Company pirate 
fleet!</p>
<p class="size2">In addition, Balagos is thought to have destroyed 
Tastrar Nagthalass and at least four other Red Wizards, as well as three
 or more Zhentarim magelings sent separately on a mission to steal magic
 from the Flying Flame's hoard. This fool's errand was ordered by Lord 
Manshoon not to win powerful magic but in hopes that Balagos would be 
goaded into pursuing the magelings to recover the lost treasure -- only 
to be lured into a trap. Certain of the elder orb beholders who support 
(some would say manipulate) Manshoon have developed a spell they believe
 will (if they surrounded the great wyrm and cast it together) put 
Balagos in mind-thrall to them, helpless to escape the endless watchful 
weight of a dozen old and mighty beholder minds. Presumably this trap 
still awaits Balagos, who avoided it by slaughtering all the Zhentarim 
who dared approach his lair.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos is a megalomaniac who truly believes he has the
 wits and might to rule all Faerûnian dragons -- and lead them in a war 
of extermination against humans and elves, leaving other beings as 
fodder to be devoured at will by the victorious wyrmkin. His mighty ego 
and raging temper doesn't render him stupid, however. Where many a red 
dragon charges into waiting death, Balagos coolly slips away and plots 
revenge by striking foes at their weakest point. (He typically flies 
away to strike at the homes and mates of those who come seeking to slay 
him, if he can learn who and where such targets are). The great red wyrm
 is more intelligent than most red dragons and has three outstanding 
talents: he never forgets the face, name, or attitude of any being he 
meets (dragon, human, or other); he is a shrewd judge of character (of 
many races, not just dragons); and he always looks ahead for 
consequences and likely outcomes. These faculties allow him to act in 
just the right way to defeat foes or further his aims as effectively as 
possible.</p>
<p class="size2">If cornered or pressed into a fight, Balagos is 
merciless and fearless, taking hurt if need be to disable a foe when he 
faces many opponents, and moving to force enemies to hamper or harm each
 other with spells and wielded weapons intended for him. He's called 
'the Flying Flame' for the effective aim of his firebreathing dive, but 
he prefers to snatch up rocks, wagons, or horses and drop them on foes 
from aloft before sending his fire-breath onto foes or moving close 
enough to face the blades of his foes directly.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos seems to need less sleep than most red dragons 
and spends the additional wakeful time he gains in wary observation of 
the land around. He often perches motionless atop a mountain peak in his
 domain, looking out over the landscape for hours. As the sage Thoravus 
of Athkatla commented in a public speech (given on Mirtul 26, 1354 DR), 
"The mind of Balagos is never still. He is always thinking -- thinking 
on how best to rise to rule all Faerûn. Most red dragons think they are 
fit to rule the world, if only the rest of us would acknowledge them. 
Balagos knows he is, and he just might, for once among all the arrogant,
 lazy failures that make up the dragonkind of today, be right. He bears 
watching. He will always bear watching."</p>
<p class="size2">Three days after that speech, Balagos swooped down from
 a clear sky and devoured Thoravus, smashing apart the sage's home in 
central Athkatla to do so. Most who witnessed the attack say the dragon 
intended to be seen, taking a deliberately leisurely approach 
beforehand, and a majestic pose atop the ruins afterward, to ensure that
 as many humans as possible saw him and were impressed. The bowmen of a 
mercenary caravan escort company hustled out into the street to fire at 
him, and he ignored their arrows as he leapt into the sky, circled 
slowly, and then flew away -- but the next day, when that company left 
the city guarding a mixed-wares caravan bound for Iriaebor, Balagos dove
 down out of the clouds and blasted or devoured every horse and being of
 the escort company -- leaving the caravan itself untouched. It's no 
wonder that in Amn and the surrounding lands, Balagos is deeply feared. 
His confidence and might make him seem truly a "Dragon King."</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Flying Flame's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Balagos lairs in the Smokespire, the most westerly peak
 of that arm of the Troll Mountains that shelters the upland forests of 
Amn north of Eshpurta, and points toward the Ridge.</p>
<p class="size2">The Smokespire is a long-extinct volcano, with a 
central cone or shaft whose walls are covered with caves and pits. Most 
of these Balagos has turned into traps, filling the pits with the 
jagged, cracked bones of creatures he has devoured, then covering them 
with the scales of fallen draconic foes and dirt. The central pit is 
adorned with a mound of blackened stone coffers and melted coins, upon 
which is coiled the bones of a burned dragon, the remains of Hulrundrar,
 the old red dragon Balagos slew to take this lair as his own. With the 
aid of a few fire spells to provide a burnt smell and some drifting 
smoke, they fool some adventurers into thinking Balagos has been slain 
-- but their foe is usually watching them from aloft, or lurking in a 
side-shaft that opens into the bottom of the central shaft, allowing the
 Flying Flame to send his breath out across the scorched pit in a deadly
 sheet of flame.</p>
<p class="size2">Counting on his own immunity to fire, the great red 
wyrm often shows himself to foes. As they are concentrating on him, he 
activates the deadliest trap in his lair: the <i>firestaff of Aunagar the Black</i>
 (a long-dead mage of Tashluta). This weapon is buried among the 
scorched coffers so that its tip is exposed, and Balagos can activate 
only one of its powers from a distance -- the one that unleashes a <i>meteor swarm</i> silently up and in any one direction desired -- using an <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=fr/fx20011205wn">awaken from afar</a></i>
 incantation. The Flying Flame triggers this behind a band of 
adventurers who face him and often melts or at least fries them all 
before a single spell is hurled or a sword raised in earnest.</p>
<p class="size2">Those who free themselves from this trap discover that 
the Smokespire is riddled with large, smooth-walled tunnels and that 
Balagos delights in dodging in and out among them, wearying intruders 
until they stop for a rest -- and become easy prey for spells or 
fire-breath sent down their tunnel.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos keeps all of his magical treasure, and most of 
his gems, buried under sand in two of the deepest caverns of his lair, 
but most intruders never find them: they're busy battling one of the 
trio of young or juvenile (never older; Balagos devours them when they 
grow too old) dragons that Balagos has captured and forced to guard 
areas of his lair, with their wings bitten away and their hunger kept 
ravenous.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos doesn't even spend most of his time in the 
Smokespire, using it instead as a lure for adventurers, Dragon Cultists,
 and other foes and would-be thieves. When he's not out exploring wider 
Faerûn (flying freely, daring other dragons to challenge him while in 
their territories) or enforcing his growing rule, he's inspecting his 
other lair, in Tethyr: the Wyrmwell, in Mount Thargil (easternmost of 
the Starspire Mountains), overlooking the former duchy of Sulduskoon 
(the upland farms between the upper Sulduskoon River and the Forest of 
Tethir).</p>
<p class="size2">This lair is named for its entry shaft -- a natural 
cauldron formed by the long ago collapse of a volcano. A thoroughly 
miserable, always-cold young adult brown dragon <i>(found in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11832">Monsters of Faerûn</a>)</i>,
 Altagos, inhabits this bowl valley, spending most of his time huddled 
in a tunnel he's scraped out in the ash, trying to get warm. He 
scrambles out smartly when intruders enter the cauldron: they're almost 
the only food he receives.</p>
<p class="size2"> Altagos is the doorguard of a lair that begins as a 
huge cavern in the eastern side of the shaft walls -- a cave that is 
home to bats. Altagos swoops among them, mouth agape, as they leave at 
dusk and return at dawn, but it takes many bats to feed a hungry dragon.
 It is also home to several helmed horrors <i>(found in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11832">Monsters of Faerûn</a>)</i>, operating under orders to attack all humanoids who try to enter or leave the cavern unaccompanied by Balagos.</p>
<p class="size2">This cavern leads to a steeply descending tunnel whose 
floor is a slick chute of melted and fused glass (prepared by Balagos, 
with his flame breath) and whose ceiling is graven with regular holds 
for a dragon's claws. (Balagos slides down into the lair to enter, and 
-- on his back, with wings folded to fit into the tunnel -- climbs up 
out of it, to exit.) At the bottom of the tunnel is a large, irregular 
natural cavern whose once-molten walls resemble iron-red flows of ice 
(everything is smooth and sweeping, because the rock flowed like water 
before hardening), once a gas cavity at the heart of the volcano. In the
 sulfurous gloom here slithers a young black dragon, Auroxas, wingless 
(thanks to the Flying Flame's jaws) and tethered here with a <i>mithral chain of woe</i>
 by Balagos, to serve as a second lair guardian. This chain is too short
 to allow him to reach the bottom of the tunnel, and when Balagos enters
 this lower cavern, he can avoid contact with any acid Auroxas might 
dare to spit by turning sharply to the left, down a way along the edge 
of the cavern that keeps many pillars of rock between the two dragons.</p>
<p class="size2">This route leads to a spot where the cavern narrows, 
noxious volcanic vapors waft up into it, and a channel of chokingly hot 
lava crosses the open space. Only a red dragon or other creature immune 
to fire and heat effects can leap, stretch, or climb across the channel 
without harm. Beyond the channel, the way widens again in two smaller 
chambers, where Balagos keeps his main metals (coins, trade-bars, and 
items such as coffers, candlesticks, and platters, that are fashioned of
 precious metal) hoard. No one knows exactly how much wealth has been 
amassed here, but the guardian dragon Auroxas believes both caverns are 
heaped almost full, because increasing amounts of coinage are spilling 
down the passage to where they can reflect the dull, angry red glow of 
the lava.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos keeps his two servitor dragon guards hungry and
 hating each other (by annually offering freedom to whichever one kills 
the other, and then towing Auroxas up into the Well to do battle with 
Altagos, only to declare neither worthy of freedom when the evenly 
matched dragons collapse from their wounds), but both would cooperate in
 an instant if they truly believed that they could win their freedom by 
doing so. The problem is that they don't believe there's a creature in 
Faerûn -- demigods and all -- who can defeat Balagos, so they dare not 
help any intruder against the Flying Flame, for fear of suffering the 
fate he often promises them: to cook small portions of their anatomy 
with his flame and then dine, leaving them alive as he nibbles away, 
taking meal after meal.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Domain of Balagos</b></p>
<p class="size2">Balagos holds sway over a domain that stretches from 
the southern edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the Giants Run 
Mountains, and from the southern banks of the upper River Chionthar 
(hard by the walls of Iriaebor) to the River Ith.</p>
<p class="size2">Many stretches of land around the edges of this area --
 and the entire Forest of Tethir, within it -- are claimed by other 
dragons, but the Flying Flame has a rather casual attitude toward 
draconic dominion that other dragons have learned to accept. Most 
dragons hide when they see him on the wing or keep to their lairs and 
ignore his passage. Balagos considers all of Faerûn to be his, and 
lesser dragons (that is, all other wyrms) to be merely custodians of 
this or that part of it, who hold their offices and lives at his 
pleasure. Every so often, he makes an example of a random dragon to keep
 the others in fear of him; his common practice at such times is to slay
 the other dragon and then fly in a slow, triumphal flight around half 
the continent, with the corpse of his vanquished foe dangling from his 
jaws, for dragons and "cattle" (humanoids) alike to gawk at.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos won his large personal holding by slaying the 
old red dragon Hulrundrar (in 1258 DR) and the venerable silver dragon 
Eacoathildarandus (in 1216 DR), whose lair was atop Scarsiir's Crag on 
the northern side of the Cloud Peaks, overlooking the Neck. The 
abandoned lair is now a monster-haunted place, with wyverns and peryton 
battling for use of the high ledges, and giant slugs and far worse 
things roaming the depths.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Balagos</b></p>
<p class="size2">Balagos is most fond of human flesh, particularly that 
of youngish females, though few communities think he can be appeased by 
offering him live maidens as sacrifices (as was once done in the 
villages of eastern Amn, in less civilized times). He relishes a good 
fight almost as much as a good meal, and he plays with prey that 
scrambles to escape or tries to fight back, while ignoring terrified 
cows that cower in fields in plain view.</p>
<p class="size2">The Flying Flame likes to bathe (unusual in a red 
dragon), and prefers to do so in the Chionthar (from which he has risen,
 dripping, at dusk, to terrify many a bargeman). He usually takes water 
at Lake Esmel or the Gaping Face Cascade (where Gaping Stream, the 
westernmost of the two tributaries of the upper Esmel River that join 
each other in the Troll Mountains and then flow south to join the Esmel 
at Trollford, is born). Balagos hunts anywhere he pleases, always over 
land and usually taking creatures on the move and not actually in 
mountains (the great wyrm is too cunning to trust confined spaces and 
the cover that caverns and rock pinnacles afford enemies).</p>
<p class="size2">To Balagos, there is no such thing as a typical day. 
He's always varying what he does, so no foe can catch him in a routine 
and no creature living in his domain can come to feel safe and 
complacent. He's as likely to alight on the roof of a coster hall in 
Athkatla as to sun himself on high ledges in the Troll Mountains, and 
every so often he flies hard and fast along the Trade Way, 40 ft. or so 
off the ground, terrifying horses and humans alike, and sending goods 
and wagons tumbling in the wind of his passing. If a farmer in Amn 
checks over his shoulder to look at the roof of his barn when coming in 
from the fields at dusk, grunting that "the King of All Dragons could be
 a-sittin' up there -- or anywhere!" Balagos is well pleased; that's 
exactly how he wants all of the creatures he rules over to feel.</p>
<p class="size2">Such behavior has won him no shortage of foes, and many
 a wizard has sought to win fame as "the destroyer of the dread Balagos"
 -- but such titles must be earned, and though a lone red dragon 
shouldn't be able to prevail against the right combination of spells and
 items, somehow Balagos always seems to survive, and the list of wizards
 who ended up as smoldering bones spit into bone pit by the Flying Flame
 grows ever longer.</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos takes no mates, though it's said he once 
consorted with Uluuthavarra, a venerable red dragon who laired somewhere
 near the Lake of Steam. In the end he had to slaughter all of his 
offspring, after they slew and ate their mother and came looking for 
him. Several wizards (including Elminster) share the belief that Balagos
 is covertly trying to research clone magics or a new kind of lichdom 
that will allow him to retain more of his powers than the Cult-assisted 
undead dragons that he contemptuously calls "bone dragons."</p>
<p class="size2">Balagos holds no special affinities or hatreds for 
anyone; all beings are his rightful subjects, and all who defy him must 
be destroyed. To many observers, he seems one of the few mad tyrants in 
Faerûn who just might have a chance to carry out such a policy and 
survive, as he already has done, for more than a thousand years.</p>
<p class="size2">Currently, Balagos is thought to be assembling a small 
band of loyal human agents whose tasks will be to strike at any human 
organization or dragon cabal that plots to work together against 
Balagos. The first few of these agents have already slain a Red Wizard 
who tried to poison the Gaping Face Cascade, so as to render Balagos 
blind and paralyzed. (The wizard had the concentration of liquids wrong 
and succeeded only in causing the great wyrm several days of 
discomfort).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Fate of Balagos</b></p>
<p class="size2">It's conceivable that the Simbul, any two of the other 
Seven Sisters, or a cabal of wizards led by Khelben, Elminster, or 
perhaps Halaster of Undermountain could defeat Balagos in face-to-face 
battle -- and that a score or more of beings resident along the Sword 
Coast, such as the ultra-lich Larloch, could destroy the Flying Flame if
 he attacked them on their home ground, where they could call on 
servitor creatures, magic items, and traps. Yet none of these mighty 
ones ever corners Balagos -- and so his arrogant rule continues from 
decade to decade, century to century, and age to age. Misadventure or a 
lucky attack could weaken the wyrm and leave him vulnerable to the 
attacks of his many enemies, but at the moment such a fate seems 
unlikely. His recent efforts to achieve immortality, or at least a 
second chance, suggest that Balagos is at last feeling the hand of time .
 . . but they also mean that his first death may not be his last. Only 
his unpredictability keeps his tyranny from becoming intolerable -- and 
so long as his brilliance never strays into foolishness, Faerûn may live
 in fear of the Flying Flame for centuries to come.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Balagos can breathe a 
70-foot cone of fire every 1d4 rounds that deals 24d10 points of fire 
damage. His breath weapon attack allows a Reflex save (DC 40) for half 
damage. Balagos is immune to his own breath weapon.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su): </b>This ability takes 
effect automatically whenever Balagos attacks, charges, or flies 
overhead. It affects only opponents with fewer than 40 Hit Dice or 
levels. The affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 38) 
or become shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to 
Balagos' frightful presence for one day. On a failure, creatures with 4 
or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds. Those with 5 or more HD 
become shaken for 4d6 rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-like Abilities (Sp):</b> 12/day--<i>locate object;</i> 3/day--<i>suggestion;</i> 1/day--<i>discern location, find the path;</i> save DC 18 + spell level; cast as a 12th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Balagos maneuvers and fights as
 well by using nonvisual senses (mostly scent and hearing) as he does 
with vision. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though he still 
can't discern ethereal beings. Balagos usually does not need to make 
Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of his blindsight
 ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dragon Traits:</b> Immune to sleep and paralysis effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Subtype:</b> Immune to fire damage; takes 
double damage from cold unless a saving throw for half damage is 
allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and double 
damage on a failure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Vision (Ex):</b> Balagos sees four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known </b>(6/8/8/8/8/7/7/7/7/4; base DC = 18 + spell level): 0 <i>arcane mark, detect magic, light, mage hand, mending, open/close, prestidigitation, read magic, resistance;</i> 1st <i>alarm, burning hands, enlarge, expeditious retreat, shield;</i> 2nd <i>bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor </i>(see <i>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting</i>), <i>pyrotechnics, see invisibility; </i>3rd <i>dispel magic, fireball, haste, slow;</i> 4th <i>fire shield, shout, stoneskin, wall of fire; </i>5th <i>dismissal, feeblemind, passwall, prying eyes;</i> 6th <i>eyebite, Tenser's transformation, true seeing; </i>7th <i>delayed blast fireball, spell turning, teleport without error; </i>8th <i>incendiary cloud, iron body, mind blank;</i> 9th <i>foresight, meteor swarm.</i></p>

precious metal including coffers, candlesticks, and platters, worth 
approximately 24,625 gp, <i>firestaff of Aunagar the Black</i>, <i>mithral chain of woe</i>, and 3 <i>potions of bull's strength</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Magic of Balagos</b></p>
<p class="size2">Little accurate information is known of the magics of 
Balagos, but it is certain that he uses some powerful items crafted by 
others. One such item is a minor artifact known as a <i>mithral chain of woe</i> and another is the aforementioned <i>firestaff of Aunagar the Black</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Mithral Chain of Woe:</b></i> This ancient, 
rarely seen item may have been crafted in long-ago Netheril, where they 
captured, subdued, and controlled (as steeds, digging forces, or beasts 
of burden) large monsters such as dragons. It consists of two mithral 
manacles that expand or shrink magically (from 3 inches to a 20-foot 
interior radius) to pass around a living body or stone spar that they're
 touched to as a command word is whispered (they do not change size if 
touched to wood or metal). A second command word causes the manacles to 
shrink again until they touch something solid -- allowing them, for 
instance, to be put over a man's head and then shrunk to clasp his neck 
snugly.</p>
<p class="size2">To open a manacle or change its size, the correct 
command words must be uttered by a creature who is directly touching the
 manacle to be affected. A heavy mithral chain links the manacles of a <i>mithral chain of woe</i>. The chain itself is 5 inches thick, and it has a hardness of 15, 150 hp, AC 9, and a break DC of 40.</p>
<p class="size2">The chain and manacles possess a resistance to both 
acid and lightning (similar to the protection from elements -- acid and 
protection from elements -- lightning spells cast at 20th level). As a 
result, those trying to use either of these elements on the item may 
find their efforts fruitless and even painful (see below).</p>
<p class="size2">A creature that strikes the manacles or chain directly 
or with any sort of weapon (regardless of its conductivity) suffers the 
effects of a <i>lightning bolt</i> spell, and such attacks cause no 
damage to the item (beings imprisoned in the manacles at the time don't 
suffer this damage). Missile attacks don't harm the launcher, but they 
also leave the chain unaffected.</p>
<p class="size2">Typically a <i>mithral chain of woe</i> is used to 
tether a powerful being to a stone spar or two beings to each other, 
usually with the chain between them wrapped around a stone pillar or 
other anchor. (In such a case the horizontal level of such a chain can 
be altered if both prisoners work together to shift the arc up or down 
the pillar, which is why this sort of tether often involves passage of 
the chain through a hole, or slot too narrow for the prisoners to pass 
through, between the anchor and either prisoner.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 20th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>lightning bolt, protection from elements -- acid, protection from elements -- electricity; Market Price:</i> 150,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 50 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Firestaff of Aunagar the Black:</b> The <i>firestaff of Aunagar the Black</i>, a long-dead Tashlutan wizard, is crafted from the heart of a suth tree. It allows the wielder to cast the following spells:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>continual flame</i> (1 charge) </li>
<li><i>fireball</i> (1 charge)</li>
<li><i>wall of fire</i> (2 charges)</li>
<li><i>delayed blast fireball</i> (2 charges)</li>
<li><i>meteor swarm</i> (3 charges)</li>
</ul>
<p class="size2">The <i>firestaff</i> also grants its current owner a +1
 resistance bonus to saving throws against fire effects and a -1 
resistance penalty to saving throws against cold effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 17th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Staff, <i>continual flame</i>, <i>delayed blast fireball</i>, <i>fireball</i>, <i>meteor swarm</i>, <i>resistance</i>, <i>wall of fire</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 135,375 gp.</p>
<p class="size2">One spell employed by Balagos is known to Elminster:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Choking Claw<br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> 10-ft. hand<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Choking claw</i> creates a Large magic hand in the 
form of a black, taloned claw that moves and attacks as directed by you.
 (You direct it as a free action). The floating hand can move up to 60 
feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by 
you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is
 no better than yours. The hand attacks once per round, and its attack 
bonus equals your level + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (for a 
wizard or sorcerer, respectively), +7 for the hand's Strength score 
(25), -1 for being Large. The hand's damage is 1d8+7. The hand cannot 
stun, grapple, or bull rush.</p>
<p class="size2">This floating, disembodied claw is 10 feet long and 
about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points
 as you when undamaged and its AC is 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes
 damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause 
damage do not affect it. The hand cannot push through a <i>wall of force</i> or enter an <i>antimagic field</i>. It suffers the full effects of a <i>prismatic wall</i> or <i>prismatic sphere</i>. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. <i>Disintegrate</i> or a successful <i>dispel magi</i>c destroys the hand.</p>
<p class="size2">By concentrating (as a standard action), you can designate a new opponent for the hand.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Focus:</i> The taloned claw of some beast.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>New Feats</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Lingering Breath [General]</b></p>
<p class="size2">Thanks to expanded lung capacity, your breath weapon lasts longer than most creatures.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Breath weapon.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Each use of your breath weapon lingers 
until the creature's next turn, and those entering or staying within the
 area of effect on the second round may take damage (see below). Those 
using Lingering Breath must decide before breathing that they are using 
the feat, otherwise the breath weapon acts as normal. Damage done in the
 second round is reduced by half. For example, a great red wyrm can 
normally breathe a cone of fire every 1d4+1 rounds doing 24d10 damage. A
 great red wyrm with the Lingering Breath feat can breath a cone of fire
 every 1d4+1 rounds that lasts 2 rounds, doing 24d10 damage the first 
round and 12d10 damage the second round.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Normal:</b> Each use of a breath weapon normally lasts one round.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wakefulness [General]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You need less sleep than others of your race to function.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You need only half the amount of sleep 
per night normal for your species to get a good night's rest. You can 
recover from fatigue after 4 hours of complete rest. You can move from 
exhausted to fatigued after half an hour of complete rest.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Normal:</b> Most creatures need 8 hours of sleep per
 night. A character can recover from fatigue after 8 hours of complete 
rest. An exhausted character becomes fatigued after 1 hour of complete 
rest.</p>
