<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2012-18%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Jalanvaloss,%20%27The%20Wyrm%20of%20Many%20Spells%27_files/dragon_243_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">When
 in Waterdeep recently, Volo was smitten by a certain enigmatic, 
dark-eyed lady who whispered to him of rare and strange spells only she 
knew. It is impossible to say from the wildly boastful notes of the 
infamous traveler whether their brief dalliance involved any true 
intimacy, and how fondly (if at all) the lady in question regards Volo 
the Loose-Tongued now, but it is clear that the florid-quilled Volothamp
 knew he was in the presence of a shapechanger whose true nature he 
couldn't fathom. It is also clear from his notes that he had no idea he 
was flirting with the steel dragon Jalanvaloss -- even though he'd come 
to Waterdeep to find out all he could about the elusive Wyrm of Many 
Spells.</p>
<p class="size2">Few folk are aware they're dealing with Jalanvaloss 
until later, because she loves the bustle and intrigues of Waterdeep. As
 an unlicensed but very active mage, she is always on the run from the 
Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors. (This deception -- and other 
similar evasions of bureaucratic money-gouging -- are the only 
unlawfulnesses Jalanvaloss embraces. She prefers not to break laws or 
disrupt daily life openly, but she sees nothing wrong in hiring or 
manipulating others to do so.)</p>
<p class="size2">In her youth, this female steel dragon (known also as a
 "Greyhawk dragon," which is its proper name according to archmage 
Mordenkainen of Oerth) was a servant of the wizard Rythtalies, a 
reclusive, white-bearded human archmage who dwelt in a now-ruined 
mountaintop keep in eastern Amn, and who is now believed dead. 
Rythtalies used Jalanvaloss as a steed but worked on turning her into 
his best "secret weapon": a being far too magically weak ever to 
seriously challenge him but one who could aid him against foes by 
launching surprise attacks.</p>
<p class="size2">Rythtalies worked several mighty magics on his steed, 
whom he came to regard highly for her keen wits and sly sense of humor. 
His magical augmentations resulted in Jalanvaloss's acquiring the 
Spellcasting Prodigy feat long after she should have been able to 
develop that ability.</p>
<p class="size2">This power is apparently permanent, having (probably) 
outlived the mage himself -- though some folk whisper that Rythtalies 
lives on in the mind of the Wyrm of Many Spells, perhaps sharing her 
body, and that the spell expertise she exhibits when wearing the form of
 a tall, sleekly beautiful human female is actually that of Rythtalies 
himself. Other folk say that whatever the source of the spells used by 
the steel dragon might be, the sentience of Rythtalies is either dead or
 slumbering; in the opinion of most wizards to whom the question is put,
 Jalanvaloss has made too many mistakes with her spellhurlings to be 
guided by (or to be the work of) an archmage.</p>
<p class="size2">Jalanvaloss is known frequently to employ <i>project image</i>
 spells to put a human image of herself in situations that allow her to 
interact with Waterdhavians (and visitors to the city -- adventurers in 
particular) without their discovering her true nature. Volo wrote plenty
 of purple-prose nonsense about his "Dark-Eyed Lady," implying that her 
loving attentions surpassed all similar pleasures in his previous 
experience of ladies all over Faerûn, but readers have no way of knowing
 how truthful the famous scribe was, or how much Jalanvaloss employs 
magic to deceive or to overwhelm the senses of humans she meets. She is 
known to manipulate Waterdhavians playfully and out of a sheer love of 
doing so, and she promotes a general air of mystery to distract 
attention from her own deeds and to set folk to doing wild and reckless 
things (something that seems to afford her much amusement).</p>
<p class="size2">First mentioned in <i>A Year of Sorcery: Wizardly Doings in the Year of the Dark Dawn</i>
 (a widely-quoted chapbook by the sage Aldiber of Memnon), Jalanvaloss 
seems to have been the pet or servitor of Rythtalies since her birth. 
She might well have been reared by him from her hatching. Aldiber writes
 of her deep loyalty in 1104 DR (at an age when most dragons are 
particularly headstrong and rebellious or defiant of authority), when 
she braved the hostile spells of two archmages to swoop in and rescue 
her master from an ambush.</p>
<p class="size2">Rythtalies seems to have disappeared sometime in 1262 
DR, though it must be emphasized that this figure is more of an 
estimation than any record of a specific disaster befalling the wizard. 
Whatever her master's ultimate fate, Jalanvaloss acted alone from then 
on, soon abandoning the keep in Amn -- which was often visited by greedy
 mages and adventurers, and well-nigh destroyed in her battles against 
them -- for the streets of Waterdeep, the City of Splendors. Jalanvaloss
 is now a mature adult steel dragon of sleek appearance, whose scales 
flash with an almost iridescent blue sheen when she's about to change 
shape into human form. She is a keen observer of people and things 
around her, never forgetting the smallest details, and she seems to 
revel in being part of as many intrigues and deceptions as possible. She
 is an actress of the first rank, and an adequate mimic. Over her years 
of residence in Waterdeep (in a succession of assumed human shapes, all 
female), she has become expert in recalling the genealogies, 
relationships, cabals, and alliances of Waterdhavians both high and low 
in station.</p>
<p class="size2">Jalanvaloss acquired the title Wyrm of Many Spells 
because of an epic spell-battle she once had with Khelben "Blackstaff" 
Arunsun: Discerning her true nature at an evening revel at the 
Brossfeather family villa, he casually tossed a <i>wyrmbane</i> spell 
her way, to drive her from the city. Jalanvaloss responded by peppering 
him with a barrage of spells, shifting from human to dragon form and 
precipitating a panic in the process that sent citizens leaping from 
balconies and trampling each other in gateways and on the streets of 
Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2">Distracted by the need to mitigate damage to the 
citizenry and the surrounding buildings, Khelben responded with magic 
designed to contain and hamper rather than to punish or destroy. 
Jalanvaloss took advantage of this tactic to make her escape. Thus, when
 the Blackstaff finally brought down a <i>binding chain of fate</i> spell on his opponent, seeking to both harm and capture her, it fell harmlessly through a <i>project image</i>
 spell. News of the spell-battle and the steel dragon's escape was all 
over the city by the following highsun, and the Copper Tongue (a 
broadsheet of news sold in the streets for a single copper coin; hence, 
its name) coined the name of "the Wyrm of Many Spells" for "the 
mysterious dragon who fought the mighty Blackstaff to a standstill." 
Jalanvaloss secured her fame in the lore of the city when she defiantly 
reappeared several nights later, flying in dragon form over Blackstaff 
Tower and raking it with spells (causing no damage and vanishing before 
the annoyed archwizard could respond or lay any sort of tracing spell on
 her).</p>
<p class="size2">According to the sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate, an 
expert on Sword Coast dragons, the Wyrm of Many Spells has "shown no 
signs of desiring the company of other wyrms, nor of dwelling in 
solitude or defending any sort of territory."</p>
<p class="size2">Volo found that while Velsaert's observations might 
well be true, Jalanvaloss does seem to enjoy wiping out rival dragons 
who cross her in any way. She is known to have destroyed utterly the 
blue dragons Calaunthriina and Daereveroese (in Amn), and the wicked 
black dragon Nabalnyth, who briefly laired in the Rat Hills.</p>
<p class="size2">The key to Jalanvaloss could be said to be her love of,
 and outstanding aptitude for, scheming. She always has a few plots to 
spare and can respond to those who cross her by calling on many (usually
 unwitting) allies. If she has a main foe, it would be the Cult of the 
Dragon, whom she would like to destroy permanently in the vicinity of 
Waterdeep. She has ignored, and will continue to ignore, attempts on 
their -- or anyone else's -- part, to lure her out of the city. Khelben 
Arunsun she regards more as an honored opponent, to be teased and 
frustrated whenever doing so will afford her a means of escape from his 
seeking magic, and taking up his time won't endanger the security of the
 city.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Lair of Jalanvaloss</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Wyrm of Many Spells rents various upper-floor rooms
 all over the city and owns several shops in Southern Ward, Trades Ward,
 and Dock Ward. (That is, the buildings are hers, and she rents the 
premises to various merchants, to run their businesses in.) All of these
 buildings are crowned with one or two floors of rental apartments, and 
at least two of them incorporate "secret apartments" (rooms retained by 
Jalanvaloss herself, which have their own entry stairs linking to 
cellars -- and thence, to nearby stables -- or the sewers). The Wyrm of 
Many Spells also owns several houses full of genteel rental rooms in Sea
 Ward and North Ward; she customarily assumes a different human shape 
when buying and visiting one shop than she wears for dealings with 
another. She is known to have at least one secret cache somewhere in the
 sewers and another in a spell-guarded tomb somewhere in the City of the
 Dead that contain nothing but clothing, makeup, and accessories that 
allow her to change one human identity for another.</p>
<p class="size2">It is hard to say which of her various Waterdhavian 
properties is her true lair; Jalanvaloss has even been known to curl up 
for a rest in dragon form on the roof of a tomb in the City of the Dead 
and use a spell to make her appear to be no more than sculpted -- and 
weathered -- stone.</p>
<p class="size2">In her various human guises, Jalanvaloss is the friend,
 ally, or business partner of many Waterdhavians, but (so far as is 
known) she can't be said to have any true servants or kin.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Domain of Jalanvaloss</b></p>
<p class="size2">Jalanvaloss doesn't patrol and defend a territory as 
most dragons do, but her domain could be said to be the city of 
Waterdeep, its underside in particular (though the pretentions and 
indulgences of its nobles afford her the most fascinated viewing and 
amusement). She'll happily share the city with other dragons who hide in
 humanshape and don't disturb city life, and she tolerates the brief 
visits of such wyrms as Galadaeros (keeping herself hidden), but will 
reveal herself to savagely fight off any wyrm who dares to attack the 
city or folk in its immediate surroundings.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Jalanvaloss</b></p>
<p class="size2">Jalanvaloss is both a sponsor and an enthusiastic fan 
of adventurers. She spends most of her time consorting with such daring 
folk. Though she admires the most capable, daring, and clever of such 
persons, her love of watching their exploits (via <i>scrying</i> and <i>arcane eye</i> spells) doesn't stop her from constantly manipulating them.</p>
<p class="size2">The Wyrm of Many Spells uses adventurers to extend her 
own long-term goals (of which more later); to set the intrigues she 
loves so much into motion; for practical reasons (such as frustrating 
local Cult of the Dragon agents as much as possible), and for short-term
 entertainment.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Fate of Jalanvaloss</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Wyrm of Many Spells has a long-term dream of 
founding her own kingdom, with herself as queen, commanding an elite 
army of human adventuring bands, to protect a cultured, prosperous elven
 populace. Perhaps in the western High Forest. . . . Realizing such a 
dream will be very difficult; it is likely to result in Jalanvaloss's 
death. She knows this danger, and that's why her notion of a realm of 
her own is a "some-distant-day" vision; she'll pursue it in earnest only
 when the daily cuts, thrusts, and intrigues of Waterdeep grow 
wearisome. Judging by her performance thus far, that's apt to be 
centuries yet and to involve the climbing of one of her human personae 
to the heights of noble rank. There is always the danger of her true 
nature being discovered, but it seems unlikely that Jalanvaloss will 
lose out in many struggles for power, or not have adventurers galore to 
call upon if something goes seriously wrong.</p>
<p class="size2">Elminster of Shadowdale, the Lady Mage of Waterdeep 
Laeral Arunsun, and at least three Harpers resident in Waterdeep know of
 the presence (if not the precise current human disguises) of 
Jalanvaloss in the city, but they're quite willing to let her remain 
part of life in the City of Splendors. In the rueful words of Laeral, 
"In many ways, she's more Waterdhavian than most Waterdhavians."</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapons (Su): </b>Once every 1d4 rounds, 
Jalanvaloss can use one of her two breath weapons. One breath weapon is a
 40-foot cone of corrosive gas that deals 7d6 points of acid damage to 
each creature in the area (Reflex DC 25 half), whether or not it needs 
to breathe. The other breath weapon is a 40-foot cone of poison gas (7

<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su): </b>This ability takes 
effect automatically when Jalanvaloss attacks, charges, or flies

fights by using nonvisual senses (mostly by hearing and scent, but also 
by vibration and other environmental clues). Invisibility and darkness 
are irrelevant, though she still can't discern ethereal beings. 
Jalanvaloss usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to

<p class="size2"><b>The Magic of Jalanvaloss</b></p>
<p class="size2">Here are two of the many magics employed by Jalanvaloss in her Waterdhavian life of endless intrigues and deceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Scattergloom<br></b>Evocation [Darkness]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Area:</b> 100 ft. radius burst<br><b>Duration:</b> I round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You create six areas of magical darkness within the 
area, which randomly and rapidly move about, giving concealment to 
nearby creatures. The areas of shadow (called "glooms") are the size of a
 Medium-size creature; they cannot leave the area of the spell.</p>
<p class="size2">The movement of the glooms gives all creatures within 
the area one-half concealment (20% miss chance). This concealment 
applies to attacks made against or by creatures in the area. An attacker
 may ready an action to attack when he has a clear line of sight to the 
target, avoiding the miss chance. </p>
<p class="size2">Two of the glooms are under your limited control. On 
your turn and as a free action while the spell is in effect, you can 
direct a controlled gloom to envelop a particular target and follow it. 
Each gloom can affect a single target of up to Medium-size in this 
manner, enshrouding it in total darkness. The target can attempt a Will 
saving throw to avoid the gloom. Success indicates the gloom goes on a 
random path like the others and does not remain affixed to the target, 
failure means the target is surrounded by magical darkness. Once 
directed at a target, a controlled gloom is out of your control.</p>
<p class="size2">You can shape the controlled glooms to resemble a 
shadowy creature of Medium-size, including an undead shadow. They retain
 their shape even after you send them after a target, so it appears that
 the gloom is some sort of incorporeal creature that has enveloped the 
target. A shaped gloom has no other abilities, it cannot be attacked (<i>dispel magic</i> and similar spells affect it normally), and it is not susceptible to turning attempts.</p>
<p class="size2">You can see normally through the glooms. This spell is 
often used to enshroud its caster (to conceal identity), with the second
 controlled shadow being "set" across a window or to block out light to 
conceal the presence of the caster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Steelsting<br></b>Evocation [Force]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 4<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> Cylinder 10 ft. wide, 25 ft. long<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You create a brief maelstrom of daggerlike flying darts
 of force that spin, slice, and rebound within the area. All within the 
area suffer 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). 
The name is a misnomer, for the spell creates neither steel nor a true 
sting.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wyrmfighting Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">Folk who must deal with dragons can never carry enough 
spells. To aid such "doomed unfortunates" (as he muttered darkly), 
Elminster reluctantly agreed to furnish details of a spell Khelben used 
in his famous "duel" with Jalanvaloss, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Binding Chain of Fate<br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 9<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> Whirling chain of force<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You create a chain of force links that whirl into a 
loop above a single creature of your choice, making a metallic rattling 
sound as it does so. The chain is 10 feet high, 10 feet thick, and forms
 a loop large enough to completely contain the target. If the creature 
fails its saving throw, the chain encircles it. The chain has several 
effects, some of which are redundant.</p>
<p class="size2">No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain defined the area of an <i>antimagic field</i>.
 This means that the target cannot use any magic, and no magic from 
outside the chain affects the creature. Any creature within the area 
defined by the chain is subject to this negation of magic.</p>
<p class="size2">The target creature cannot leave the area defined by 
the chain. Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although they 
normally must go over or under the chain, since the chain itself is a 
force barrier similar to a barred <i>cage</i> form of the <i>forcecage</i>
 spell). If the target was in midair (flying, levitating, and so on) 
when the chain took effect, the chain suspends the target in midair 
safely as if it had a solid floor.</p>
<p class="size2">The chain prevents the target from changing form, 
including lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or 
polymorph or similar effects.</p>
<p class="size2">The chain acts as a <i>dimensional anchor</i> upon the target.</p>
<p class="size2">The chain deals 1d6 points of force damage per round to the target.</p>
<p class="size2">The chain cannot be dispelled, but it can be destroyed by more powerful magic such as <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>Mordenkainen's disjunction</i>, <i>wish</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">There is a specific but little-known counterspell that 
prevents a protected target from being enchained. Certain writings in 
Candlekeep also speak of at least two methods of magically shattering a 
chain, each employing a different trio of specific 9th-level spells that
 must be cast at or on the chain (obviously by someone outside of the 
chain's area) within 3 consecutive rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Material Component:</i> The hair of a creature with at least three spell-like abilities and any magic potion.</p>

admit that he's wandered the back streets of Waterdeep more than once in
 the Old Mage's footsteps, though -- and he has a bathrobe that reeks of
 truly strange pipesmoke to prove it. Elminster said that the torn and 
patched blue terrycloth was the only clothing Ed owned that was good 
enough for his debut in the City of Splendors.</p>
