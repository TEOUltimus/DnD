<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2010-23%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Hoondarrh,%20%27Red%20Rage%27_files/dragon_241_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">Most
 folk who dwell up and down the Sword Coast have heard of the Red Rage 
of Mintarn. That may make the venerable red dragon Hoondarrh one of the 
most famous wyrms in history though most folk think he's no more than a 
fancy tale concocted to scare children. </p>
<p class="size2">Yet the Sleeping Wyrm of Skadaurak is very much alive. 
Few villages may be torn apart under his talons these days, and fewer 
ships burnt to ashes, as the rich and satisfied Hoondarrh begins his 
second Long Sleep, but his relative absence from the scene doesn't make 
him dead or a mere legend. </p>
<p class="size2">The confusion surrounding Hoondarrh is due largely to 
his connections with two other famous dragons: Skadaurak, whom he slew 
to gain his present lair; and Angkarasce the Lost, whose hoard Hoondarrh
 seized. (Angkarasce was a white dragon whose sorcery and wealth were 
unmatched in the early days of human settlement of the Sword Coast, and 
who wore a cloak of splendid legends because of it. He is long dead, 
consumed by his own sorceries as he sought to enspell himself into 
immortality.) </p>
<p class="size2">Some say Hoondarrh is Skadaurak, or his son; others 
believe that something is on the isle where Hoondarrh lairs that makes 
dragons sleep and then awaken revitalized and in new bodies -- and that 
the Red Rage of Mintarn is really Angkarasce the Mighty in a younger 
body of a different breed, but with the same fell old wisdom and 
sorcery. </p>
<p class="size2">Growing as confused as the bards and sages of the 
North? The best way to learn the truth (something Volo never did) is to 
follow the known life of Hoondarrh down the years. With Elminster's aid,
 we can trace the career of a dragon whose toll of slain adventurers 
still rises with each passing decade. </p>
<p class="size2">Hoondarrh was born somewhere in the eastern Sword Coast
 North in the late summer of the Year of Scorching Suns (460 DR). The 
first hatchling of a brood whose parents quarreled, leaving one dead and
 the other sorely wounded, Hoondarrh was always large, vigorous, and 
aggressive. He slew and devoured his fellow hatchlings, and soon he grew
 bold enough to challenge his remaining parent. </p>
<p class="size2">Hoondarrh lost that fight but escaped with his life, 
fleeing westward into the chaos of chill mists, icebergs, and desolate 
islands that cloak the northernmost Sword Coast. There he devoured many 
creatures, growing in size, cunning, and strength, until a fateful night
 in the Year of Fire and Frost (600 DR), when he swooped down on a human
 expedition struggling in the snows to find a pass through the Spine of 
the World and devoured the lot of them. On the body of one expedition 
member, the wizard Tharilim of Calimport, was a magic gem: an emerald as
 big as a human fist, the <i>Ongild</i> (named for the Halruaan wizard who had crafted it). This gem has the powers of a <i>ring of regeneration</i>, and it empowers anyone bearing it to use four particular spells once per day at caster level 18 (Elminster believes they are <i>delayed blast fireball</i>, <i>prismatic spray</i>, <i>reverse gravity</i>, and <i>spell turning</i>). The <i>Ongild</i>
 is still lodged somewhere in Hoondarrh's innards, walled away in a 
canker, and he can call on its powers even today. At the time, the <i>Ongild's</i>
 powers both astonished the dragon and gave him fresh confidence. After 
experimenting with his new-found magical might (slaying at least one 
young dragon in the process), he set forth to challenge his surviving 
parent.</p>
<p class="size2">He won the battle this time and found himself owner of a
 small hoard in a crumbling mountain cave -- just as an orc horde boiled
 down out of the north. Hoondarrh swooped into their midst, slaying and 
devouring at will. At first he simply lost himself in the exultation of 
killing, but then he undertook either to obliterate the horde or to 
lessen it so that no orcs reached his newly won lair. He succeeded in 
the latter goal, but his repeated attacks attracted the notice of 
another wyrm, Naroun the Great White Ghost, who is a legend among orcs 
for his habit of gliding along very low above the snows, snatching up 
prey with his talons as he came upon them. Naroun attacked the intruder,
 and the white wyrm and the red cartwheeled across the sky for two days 
before the Great White Ghost died in a collision with a mountain peak, 
and the bloody, sorely wounded Hoondarrh could collapse on a nearby 
ridge to heal. </p>
<p class="size2">He lay there for days, twitching feebly, as the <i>Ongild</i>
 did its work -- only to be rudely interrupted one morning when the 
ridge slid out from under him in an avalanche that carried him down into
 a cramped bowl valley and laid bare one side of a long-buried cavern 
crammed with sparkling gems and heaps of ancient coins. The bones of a 
dead dragon were stretched out atop all this wealth, and Hoondarrh 
thrust them aside to claim the pile as his own bed. </p>
<p class="size2">From magic items among the hoard, as he lay there 
healing, Hoondarrh learned the bones were those of the legendary 
Angkarasce the Lost. Many of the magic items buried under the resting 
Hoondarrh were metal orbs that stored spells, and from them the red 
dragon gleaned a roster of spells he could cast to augment the four 
spells of the <i>Ongild</i>. </p>
<p class="size2">Hoondarrh realized he had at a single stroke become 
richer than most dragons had ever become and that the cavern, raked by 
the howling storm winds of winter, was no longer a suitable lair. He had
 to find or make a better home -- a place to keep safe his new-found 
hoard. </p>
<p class="size2">Elminster believes that gaining this truly awesome 
hoard early on kept Hoondarrh largely free of the gnawing hunger for 
wealth that dominates most red dragons, replacing it instead with a 
desire for security. </p>
<p class="size2">It is known that when the red dragon was healed, he 
brought down the roof of the cavern to bury the hoard once more. Then he
 set forth on a long and bloody exploration of the Sword Coast North. 
For years he flew far and wide, battling dragons wherever he found them,
 but not bothering to pursue those who hid or fled. He was searching for
 the right lair, learning all the while who dwelt where in this vast 
land of snows and mountains and endless forests. </p>
<p class="size2">The growing settlements of men fascinated Hoondarrh. 
After destroying a few with almost casual ease, he discovered that lying
 hidden and watching the deeds of men (with the aid of a long-range <i>arcane eye</i>
 spell gleaned from one of his orbs) was far greater entertainment -- 
and alerted him to when herds of livestock would be driven north into 
his waiting jaws. </p>
<p class="size2">From this time spent lying on mountaintops overlooking 
Waterdeep and other human cities came Hoondarrh's love of pranks, bold 
deceptions, and treachery among humans and humanoids. Occasionally he 
grew restless or hungry, and erupted from his rests into wild flights of
 slaughter and devouring, usually ranging up and down the islands off 
the Sword Coast from the Moonshaes to the Nelanther. The big, brawling 
red dragon became a familiar sight in coastal skies -- a sight that 
evoked terror. </p>
<p class="size2">Often Hoondarrh wheeled above ships of cowering men 
bellowing with sky-shaking laughter at their terrified antics and 
sparing them, but when he became enraged, he'd attack the strongest 
castles with his talons and spells, bringing mighty fortresses crashing 
down into ruin. </p>
<p class="size2">Thankfully, Hoondarrh usually flew inland when hungry. 
In his explorations, Hoondarrh had discovered the great fun of flying 
low over the Shaar with jaws agape to scoop up wild horses and other 
roaming herd beasts by the ton. Orc hordes occasionally provided him 
with more local gluttony, but the red dragon hunted the coast itself for
 food less and less often. </p>
<p class="size2">What Hoondarrh was still seeking, as the centuries 
passed, was a lair. He found it one spring day in the Year of the 
Singing Arrows (884 DR), when the great red wyrm Skadaurak awakened from
 a Long Sleep in his cavern on the island that bore his name (the 
northernmost of the two islands northwest of Mintarn). </p>
<p class="size2">Skadaurak had been sleeping for almost 1,000 years, employing <i>Saldrinur's Slow Gem</i>,
 a Halruaan magic item that plunges its wearer into temporal stasis of a
 set duration (usually two or four centuries, though the user may set 
any time). Such a sleep may be interrupted by any number of preselected 
alarm conditions. Its maker, Saldrinar of the Seven Spells, used it to 
live far beyond his normal span, to a time in which safe and secure 
alternatives to lichdom had been mastered and escaped into one of them. 
(Elminster will say no more of this, beyond the curt advice: "Even 
diligent readers should always be chasing some secrets.") </p>
<p class="size2">By use of this magic jewel, Skadaurak also sought to 
live on until magic to rival that of Netheril rose again among the 
ambitious, creative, everstriving human wizards, and he might find a 
sorcerer who'd give him immortality in return for the magic he'd 
amassed. During his extended slumbers, the Red Terror of Mintarn had 
become a legend of the dim past, with most folk believing him long dead 
if they remembered him at all. </p>
<p class="size2">They were not far wrong. When he dug his way out of his
 mountainside cavern and shook out stiff, long-unused wings to fly 
inland to find food, Skadaurak found instead an old red dragon of 
unusual size and vigor plunging down out of the sky at him. </p>
<p class="size2">He flapped hastily aloft -- straight into spell after 
rending spell, followed by the teeth and talons of Hoondarrh himself. 
The younger red dragon tore apart his sleepy rival and descended without
 delay to examine the newly-revealed lair. </p>
<p class="size2">It seemed perfect, and it even came furnished with a 
respectable hoard; much smaller than that of Angkarasce, but even more 
rich in magic. Hoondarrh explored it and soon found the <i>Slow Gem</i>.
 Since acquiring the fabled hoard of the Lost Dragon, Hoondarrh had been
 too rich to care about mere wealth, but here was something that made 
him hungry again. To live forever. . . .</p>
<p class="size2">First he needed to make this lair as secure as any lair
 could be. He set to work enlarging it and ferrying his wealth hence, 
and so he spent two solid years before being attacked by adventurers. </p>
<p class="size2">Their fate was no grander than to be a quick meal, but 
their attempt reminded Hoondarrh that the grasping little annoyances 
known as humans were perhaps his deadliest foes. He set about delving 
out caverns all around his true lair and flying far afield in search of 
wizards and artisans, employing spells to spy such folk out and 
communicate with them from a safe distance. </p>
<p class="size2">On the island north of Mintarn, several "false lairs" 
came into being: newly-dug caves baited with excess treasure and well 
furnished with traps installed by the mages and dwarven stonecutters 
Hoondarrh had hired. These artisans were given free rein in developing 
fiendish waiting deaths for human-sized intruders. </p>
<p class="size2">A special team of mages were even paid their own 
weights in gems to acquire some of the beasts known as deepspawn, and so
 arrange the rearing of these strange monsters that they spat forth 
rothé, horses, and cattle. The 'spawn were installed in caves on the 
neighboring island to furnish Hoondarrh with everyday food. </p>
<p class="size2">When he was satisfied that the defenses of his lair 
were strong (a conclusion reached after two unsuccessful pirate raids 
and a stealthy dragon attack that ended in bloody disaster for the 
mercury dragon attempting it), the Red Rage sent away the last of his 
artisans. Sealing his cavern with boulders and spells, Hoondarrh fared 
forth across Faerûn, spending a leisurely two seasons hunting down and 
devouring all of his former employees he could find, to keep his secrets
 as safe as possible. He'd forgotten that humans could write things down
 and so pass trouble on down the years. </p>
<p class="size2">One winter day in the Year of the Empty Hand (896 DR), 
the folk of Mintarn were startled by the thunderous arrival of a huge 
red dragon in the meadows above their harbor. Desperate to protect their
 meager livestock, they tremblingly took up arms -- but they were 
astonished when the dragon let it be known he'd come to bargain: If they
 paid him a gold piece per inhabitant per year, he'd let them all live, 
and even protect them against pirates. </p>
<p class="size2">They accepted -- as the elders muttered, what else 
could they do? -- and received another surprise when the dragon told the
 crew of the first tribute ship to stop by his other isle on their way 
home and take for their own not more than two cows each. </p>
<p class="size2">Sages have debated the motives behind the unusual 
kindness of Hoondarrh for years, but according to Elminster, the Red 
Rage dealt with the folk of Mintarn as he did solely to gain a 
reputation. As he happily raided coastal shipping and lands, the folk of
 Mintarn told all whom they traded with of his vast wealth and 
trap-guarded lair . . . and the greedy adventurers started to come. </p>
<p class="size2">Such visitors provide Hoondarrh with entertainment and 
magic. He enjoys watching intruders get maimed in his traps before he 
devours them, and he also likes to gather magic items of any sort -- 
from gathering <i>belts of feather fall</i> to <i>rods of lordly might </i>--
 and gains a fairly steady flow of such baubles from the adventurers he 
has lured into his waiting claws. Only Hoondarrh knows the ways around 
all of the traps on his island and the traps that in turn guard those 
ways around. </p>
<p class="size2">In the meantime, he undertakes decade-long sleeps, 
using the jewel wrought by Saldrinar. Between slumbers, he entertains 
himself by watching from afar the activities of humans (in particular, 
in the city of Waterdeep). He rewards humans and others whose jests, 
pranks, treacheries and intrigues amuse him by paying them handsomely --
 though he'll hunt anyone who dares to steal from him clear around Toril
 if need be. Always he seeks word of wizards working on magic concerned 
with eternal life or enhanced longevity. </p>
<p class="size2">Though the Red Rage suspects the elves of Evermeet and 
the human mages of Halruaa and Thay have progressed in such studies 
beyond all others, he fears to approach lands bristling with powerful, 
well-organized mages, and thus far only tries to pry into goings-on in 
those places by hiring spies. </p>
<p class="size2">Ambitious adventurers are advised that Hoondarrh the 
Mighty pays well, but he has a habit of devouring agents who fail him, 
irritate him, or who he thinks are learning too much about him or his 
lair. They are further warned that his isle boasts a collection of traps
 unsurpassed in all Faerûn, and has claimed the lives of even powerful 
mages who prudently sought only to escape it soon after their arrival. </p>
<p class="size2">Now a venerable wyrm of increasingly lengthy sleeps and
 lessening energy, Hoondarrh dreams of a mate and offspring and becomes 
increasingly impatient for the achievement of immortality, for he dare 
not allow himself intimacy until he is secure in its everlasting 
protection. </p>
<p class="size2">A fighter of almost unmatched experience and cunning, 
the Red Rage of Mintarn is known to have defeated foes as formidable as a
 quartet of beholders who sought his treasure and tried to trick him 
into a prepared killing-ground with news of immortality spells they were
 willing to trade. </p>
<p class="size2">Hoondarrh also possesses a knowledge of the lay of the 
land of western Faerûn (as seen from the air) matched by no other living
 being and is said to be an increasingly accomplished caster of the many
 spells he has inherited from his various hoards, knowing how to combine
 magic to devastating effect. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hoondarrh's Lair </b></p>
<p class="size2">The Red Rage maintains at least two sleeping-caverns 
stocked with food-producing deepspawn and treasure -- one on a remote 
island near the Icepeak, and another somewhere inland in the mountains 
of the Sword Coast North. His main lair on the isle of Skadaurak, 
however, is a vast complex of subterranean rooms -- in fact, a 
recently-built "dungeon." It has no less than three shafts where a large
 red dragon can fly in and out with wings spread; one of them turns back
 to angle almost straight up into a mountain peak, and there ends in the
 main treasure cavern. </p>
<p class="size2">The rest of the island is honeycombed with trap-filled 
false lairs. Some of these are even home to a few bold brigands, whom 
Hoondarrh suffers to live because they amuse him with their furtive 
diggings, and they have learned not to dare any open assault on his main
 caverns. From time to time he snatches one up and dumps the man in 
Baldur's Gate or Waterdeep or Athkatla, to babble tales of the vast and 
rich lair that sprawls through the very heart of the isle of Skadaurak, 
and so lure more adventurers hence. </p>
<p class="size2">Though Hoondarrh is not known to possess any sentient 
servants, his lair seems alive with golems and gargoylelike automatons 
of various sorts -- and even with captive monsters that are kept 
ravenously hungry. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hoondarrh's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From his lair, Hoondarrh roams Faerûn more or less at 
will, avoiding magic-strong realms such as Evermeet, Thay, and Halruaa. 
He also largely avoids combat with other dragons, though he'll humble or
 cripple a persistent foe. If pressed, he'll try to "flee" out over the 
Sea of Swords and trick his foe into diving at him before using a <i>wingbind</i> spell so they'll plunge helplessly under the waves and drown. </p>
<p class="size2">He enjoys roaming the backlands and the Shaar, chasing 
down food, but his domain is the coastal islands up and down the Sword 
Coast. He delights in toying with ships south of Mintarn, and only his 
Long Sleeps have kept humans from abandoning water travel in the region.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Hoondarrh</b></p>
<p class="size2">The favorite prey of Hoondarrh is a creature who has 
tried to cheat or outwit him. He is contemptuous of most good-aligned 
dragons and delights in surprising wyrms of all sorts with the strength 
and variety of his own magic. If he's not sleeping at the heart of his 
lair, Hoondarrh spends most days scrying events in western Faerûn -- and
 so is almost never surprised by events or intruders. </p>
<p class="size2">Currently Hoondarrh has his eye on certain ambitious 
rising mages in Tethyr and among the noble families of Waterdeep. Surely
 some of them will agree to develop spells to keep a dragon young and 
vigorous for extra years, in return for financial sponsorship and timely
 magical aid -- if only he can trust any of them and find a way to make 
that trust binding. </p>
<p class="size2">Over the last four decades, the Red Rage has thrice 
sent illusions that he can speak through, in the shapes of attractive 
humans, to meet with selected individuals of rising magical power. In 
such guise he always purports to represent this or that fictitious 
dragon and requests that the mage develop specific draconic-assistance 
spells (a magic to swiftly heal torn wings or to regenerate scales) in 
return for wealth and his protection or at least spell-hurling aid. 
Hoondarrh feels that anything so blunt as a revelation of his goal of 
immortality can wait until he's addressing a trusted ally with whom he's
 worked successfully for a decade or more. </p>
<p class="size2">One prospect rejected the offer with a frantic 
whirlwind of fearful and angry spells. Another, obviously but shyly 
smitten with the attractive agent, cited overwhelming present pressures 
of work and oppressive local politics, requesting that he be contacted 
later. Subsequent overtures yielded a variety of excuses, but never a 
definite acceptance or refusal. Eventually Hoondarrh allowed himself a 
snarl, then moved on. </p>
<p class="size2">The third wizard, Elquaern Hunabar (of the noble 
Hunabars of Waterdeep) accepted the offer and set to work. Three spells 
were duly produced, but the Red Rage detected a flaw in one spell and 
suspected that the others also contained deficiencies -- small, covert 
weaknesses. He requested a face-to-face meeting of dragon and mage. 
Several times the offer was politely accepted, but then delays were 
always requested. Hoondarrh made thoughtful preparations for the 
long-awaited encounter . . . preparations he suspected were more than 
matched in thoughtfulness by his counterpart. </p>
<p class="size2">The meeting finally occurred in the Caraww, a large but
 shallow cavern in the rising hillsides just west of Rassalantar. The 
gaping-mouthed cave had long been known as a haunt of bears and the 
occasional leucrotta, but no one had suspected that a dragon made its 
lair there. When Elquaern left his bodyguard and grimly scrambled up a 
bracken-cloaked slope into the Caraww, a seemingly solid side wall of 
the cavern faded away like smoke to reveal a mound of loose coins and 
the head of a green dragon peering around it. More of Elquaern's patron,
 who introduced herself as Galarrdratha, became visible as the sorcerer 
stepped forward. All pleasantries ceased abruptly when the dragon calmly
 asked Elquaern what treacheries he intended, citing the suspicious 
details of his spells -- details that a dragon could not help but notice
 seemed intended to give an informed human some measure of control over 
any wyrm casting them. </p>
<p class="size2">The proud young Hunabar wasted no breath on a reply but
 activated a spell that cloaked him in multiple defensive spells, then 
let fly at Galarrdratha with two magic rods. Their fury caused the 
illusory wyrm no damage, accomplishing little more than sending stone 
shards slashing about the cavern, but Elquaern's defenses saved him from
 any harm, so the watching Hoondarrh used a spell of his own to bring 
down the ceiling of the Caraww. No more has been heard since of 
Galarrdratha the green dragon, or of Elquaern Hunabar, but the 
much-enlarged Caraww is sometimes used by shepherds seeking shelter for 
their flocks against driving storms. Hoondarrh's discreet inquiries 
continue . . . as does his use of aliases.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hoondarrh's Fate </b></p>
<p class="size2">Very few dragons have attained immortality, but if no 
one slays the Red Rage of Mintarn in the next 30 years or so (and he 
practically goads sorcerers and adventurers to do so), he stands a good 
chance of becoming some sort of ghost dragon. He's only a few spells 
away from putting such a disembodied essence into control of a 
dragonlike mechanical construct or zombie dragon body . . . but he is 
proceeding cautiously for fear that the Cult of the Dragon will learn of
 his state and swoop in at a crucial moment to seize control over him. </p>

37 half). Once he has used his breath weapon, he must wait 1d4 rounds 
before doing so again. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Crush: </b>When flying or jumping, Hoondarrh can 
land on Huge or smaller opponents as a standard action, using his whole 
body to crush them. A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit

<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su): </b>This ability takes 
effect automatically when Hoondarrh attacks, charges, or flies overhead.
 It affects only opponents with 34 or fewer Hit Dice or levels within a 
radius of 300 feet. Each affected creature must make a successful Will 
save (DC 34) to resist the effect. On a failure, a creature with 5 or 
more Hit Dice or levels becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds, and a creature 
with 4 or fewer Hit Dice or levels becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds. 
Success indicates that the target is immune to Hoondarrh's frightful 
presence for one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 10/day -- locate object; 3/day -- <i>suggestion</i>; 1/day -- <i>find the path</i>. Caster level 15th; save DC 17 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> Hoondarrh casts spells as a 15th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep: </b>Hoondarrh can sweep with his tail as
 a standard action. The sweep affects a half circle with a diameter of 
40 feet, centered on his rear. Every Large or smaller creature within 
the swept area takes 2d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 37 
half). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> The creature maneuvers and 
fights as well as a sighted creature by using nonvisual senses (mostly 
by hearing and scent, but also by vibration and other environmental 
clues). Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though the creature 
still can't discern ethereal beings. 300 ft. range. The creature usually
 does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within 
range of its blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Subtype: </b>Hoondarrh is immune to fire 
damage, but he takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for 
half damage is allowed, in which case he takes half damage on a success 
and double damage on a failure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities: </b>Hoondarrh is immune to fire, <i>sleep</i>, and paralysis effects. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses (Ex): </b>Hoondarrh has darkvision 
(1,000-foot range) and low-light vision (can see four times as far as a 
human in low-light conditions and twice as far in normal light).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Regeneration: </b>Hoondarrh's gem allows him to heal damage as though he had a <i>ring of regeneration.</i></p>

<p class="size2">The Red Rage of Mintarn commands a vast arsenal of 
spells gained from his hoards, and over a score of portable magic items 
his spells can trigger, to give him magic well beyond the spell levels a
 venerable red dragon can normally attain. </p>

 casting them to hedge an enemy in between the spread and his own breath
 weapon. [Widen Spell is a +3 level metamagic feat from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?WTC11964">Magic of Faerûn</a></i> that increases the area of a burst, emanation, or spread by 50%.]</p>

this spell, its wings are only partially paralyzed. Its fly speed is 
reduced to one-half and its fly maneuverability drops by one category.

 with the wings have a -2 circumstance penalty.</p>
