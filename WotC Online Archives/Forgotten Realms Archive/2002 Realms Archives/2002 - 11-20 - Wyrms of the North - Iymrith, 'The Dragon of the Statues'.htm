 investigations of Volo include some confused notes about a 
"desert-dwelling giant blue dragon that seems to have some magical link 
with a . . . way of surviving sandstorms? Special magic?" Elminster has 
consented to lay bare rather more than such cryptic queries about the 
Doom of the Desert, Iymrith, the blue dragon of the Chill Sands. Few 
folk of the North ever see this legendary "Dragon of the Statues" unless
 they brave the frigid wastes of Anauroch east of ruined Ascore, or dare
 to explore the Netherese ruins scattered up and down the Fallen Lands 
along the western edge of the Great Desert. Iymrith roams these regions 
tirelessly. She is engaged in an extended exploration of the surviving 
ruins of Netheril and has already gained much old magic from them. She 
has also developed quite a few unusual spells. Perhaps the most 
important of these is the magic that has kept her alive thus far: <i>force burn</i>,
 a spell derived from magic left behind by Netherese mages that is 
deadly to the subterranean race known as the phaerimms. Fear of it has 
driven them to ignore Iymrith rather than turning their power to the 
task of destroying her.</p>
<p class="size2">Adventurers are warned that Iymrith has developed 
spells that employ sand as a weapon -- and that apparently confer the 
ability to use such magic on some of the many gargoyle servants she has 
created. Iymrith is first heard of in adventurers' journals written 
circa 570 D.R. as a young and aggressive dragon who smashed a Bedine 
trading encampment on the edge of the desert, who tore apart a caravan 
bound for the distant Sword Coast, and who left the camp laden with 
desert gems.</p>
<p class="size2">Iymrith apparently challenged an older dragon somewhere
 in the vicinity of the High Moor shortly after her emergence from 
Anauroch -- and had to flee for her life. Sorely wounded, she crashed 
into some ruins (possibly remnants of fallen Netheril) in the Forgotten 
Forest and hid for some years, healing slowly and stealing forth only by
 night to find food. At some point during this time of nighthunting, she
 somehow gained magic beyond the normal capabilities of even the oldest 
blue dragons; Elminster believes she was captured by a powerful archmage
 and modified by him to serve as an intelligent servant. This belief is 
supported by sightings of a blue dragon flying over the Delimbiyr Vale 
with a disintegrating, robed human skeleton perched between her 
shoulders in a high-backed saddle. This was almost certainly Iymrith, 
who soon began to raid camped caravans and Sword Coast settlements by 
night, unleashing wizard spells from a roster strong and varied enough 
that many mages used magic -- in vain -- to hunt down a rogue wizard 
they believed to be dwelling in hiding somewhere in the Greypeak 
Mountains.</p>
<p class="size2">Iymrith apparently turned to digging apart the ruins 
along the western Desertsedge when a chance landing to rest yielded her a
 stone chest packed full of spellbooks. Her enthusiastic digging brought
 her jaw-to-jaw with her first phaerimm, and her life very nearly ended 
there, but the narrow escape alerted her to this mighty menace from 
below, and she redoubled her efforts to find magic, which she carried 
off to a windswept mountaintop. Inevitably, Iymrith was seen flying back
 and forth and was confronted by an adventuring band hoping to be rich 
dragonslayers by the end of the day. They ended up as corpses instead, 
and Iymrith was goaded into experimenting with certain of the spells 
she'd already found to make her first gargoyles. Iymrith needed loyal, 
sturdy servants to guard her lair and dig for her while she kept watch 
for phaerimms and humans from a safe vantage point. Her gargoyles began 
as crude, ungainly gliding stone monsters but soon grew more elegant and
 deadly. </p>
<p class="size2">When her gargoyle army was strong enough, Iymrith set 
them to digging up Netherese ruins, while she spent hours flying high 
above the western desert and adjoining lands, seeking herds of rothé and
 the like for food and ruins that might not be visible from the air. The
 shifting sands of Anauroch soon rewarded her when she unveiled the 
leaning top of a lone sorcerer's tower. Iymrith tore it open and found 
her richest magic yet. She made it her lair for some centuries, until 
one day phaerimms came boiling up out of its depths to slay her. By 
then, Iymrith was ready for them. Her <i>force burn</i> spells and other
 magic destroyed many phaerimms and sent the rest fleeing -- and in the 
time she'd won by her victory, the Doom of the Desert set about shifting
 all of her accumulated treasure north to another ruin she'd found as 
the restless sands laid it bare: a stone city roamed only by the 
skeletons of undead Bedine. The dragon has still not learned the city's 
name but has dwelt in it ever since, driving away all other dragons and 
phaerimms who approach, and making ever-stronger gargoyles to dig into 
the city's tombs and cellars for her and to guard what she has already 
gained. The key to Iymrith's character is her driving, all-consuming 
ambition. In the words of Elminster, she is "the least lazy and sleepy 
wyrm I have ever known."</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Iymrith's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Though she has several caverns in the Greypeak and 
Sunset Mountains (caves that have their own pools of water but which she
 keeps otherwise bare), the Doom of the Desert's lair is the nameless 
ruined city that lies northeast of Ascore, half-buried in sand. There 
she lies atop her hoard of gems in a huge temple or meeting-hall, with 
her tail filling the entrance to her smaller chamber of magic. All 
around her are gargoyle guardians, and her lesser gargoyle servants fly 
patrols to watch for intruders, tunnel the sandchoked chambers and 
passages beneath her, and tirelessly transport rocks from the nearby 
mountains to create a permanent "windbreak dune" or wall on the windward
 side of the city.</p>
<p class="size2">At least one adventuring band has reported being fired 
upon by "stonehurling engines" (trebuchets) that were aimed and re-aimed
 with great accuracy by gargoyles seeking to dissuade any invasion of 
the city. These weapons could hurl showers of boulders almost a mile 
from the crumbling outer walls of the ancient city -- reinforced by 
gargoyles swooping on the intruders from aloft, dropping boulders on 
them.</p>
<p class="size2">Teeter-totter pitfall traps and spellhurling gargoyles 
were reported by the only mage to reach the city streets and survive. 
(He gained entry -- and soon left hastily -- by means of <i>teleport</i> spells.)</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Iymrith's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From her nameless city, Iymrith roams the western edge 
of Anauroch as far south as the Greycloak Hills and as far west as the 
eastern edge of the High Forest (now that Hellgate Keep is no longer the
 peril it once was). She seems to like colder climes, unlike most blue 
dragons, and flies occasional forays as far north as where the Ice 
Mountains meet the glaciers.</p>
<p class="size2">The Doom of the Desert regards her city -- and the ways
 beneath it, as far down as they may exist -- as her exclusive 
territory. Any phaerimms, drow, human adventurers, or anyone else 
entering it becomes her food as swiftly as she can bring about such a 
fate. The rest of the area she flies over she rules lightly by watching 
events more than enforcing her will. She is known occasionally to make 
hunting flights (in search of herds of livestock, usually) that carry 
her far afield.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Iymrith</b></p>
<p class="size2">The blue dragon of the Chill Sands has spells that 
readily thaw ice into drinkable water. There is ice in plenty beneath 
her city, and much more only a short flight away in all directions 
except south or due west. She seemingly eats anything, so long as 
there's lots of it, but she doesn't seem to grow hungry too often. She 
spends most days examining magic items brought to her by her gargoyle 
miners and experimenting with the spells and items she already has to 
derive new and more powerful magic.</p>
<p class="size2">Iymrith creates new servitor gargoyles every dozen days
 or so, but she is becoming increasingly obsessed with her own survival 
and has interrupted her usual augmentation of her gargoyle army to 
experiment with the creation of multiple bodies for herself. At present 
she can "jump" her essence from her real body to a mechanical body and 
to at least two statues, but she hasn't yet crafted a second living 
body.</p>
<p class="size2">The statues Iymrith has created are as large as she is,
 and all six of them look like stiffly-posed blue dragons made of single
 smooth-finished blocks of stone. (She's actually fused rock together 
with <i>flowstone</i> spells to make them.) When she teleports them 
about or links with them either to cast spells through them (just as a 
human mage can make certain spells emanate from a <i>project image</i> spell) or to move her sentient self-essence into them, the statues' pupilless eyes come alive with tiny flames.</p>
<p class="size2">Iymrith's driving aim is to gain all the magic she can 
and thereby rise to supremacy over all other dragons, phaerimms, or 
anyone else who might challenge her. Then she can live forever, crafting
 ever-stronger magic. No one knows whether she'll ever feel secure 
enough to think of mating, dwelling elsewhere, or sharing her magic with
 beings not of her own creation.</p>
<p class="size2">Certain Bedine tribes worship Iymrith -- from a safe 
distance. They leave behind offerings of polished sapphires. Thus far, 
Iymrith has suffered them to live and even safely approach the city 
walls until they can see her central hall clearly. She's never rendered 
them the slightest aid, however, and might just be humoring them idly.</p>
<p class="size2">Iymrith has mastered various magical means of 
teleporting groups of creatures and is known to use this method to 
capture herds of snow rothé and other edible beasts when her supply of 
food runs low. (The harsh climate and scant grazing provender causes 
this shortage to happen fairly often.)</p>
<p class="size2">The Doom of the Desert seems to find crafting items 
tiresome, but tinkering with the casting of spells holds endless 
fascination for her and consumes most of her days. Perhaps once every 
eight days or so she momentarily tires of magical experimentation and 
indulges herself in farscrying Faerûn around her to keep track of what's
 happening elsewhere. She does this in a whimsical manner rather than 
taking thorough or defensive care over it.</p>
<p class="size2">Less than a decade ago, Iymrith's spells ensnared the 
Company of the Flame Spider. Named for the exotic dancer who sponsored 
them, this band of fumbling magelings and disaffected mercenaries was 
formed in Athkatla. After several unrewarding forays into the High Moor 
and the ruins of Illefarn, they undertook a commission from the Merchant
 League to explore the chill northern reaches of Anauroch, seeking a 
trade route east or at least a series of landmarks that travelers across
 the shifting sands could rely on.</p>
<p class="size2">A dozen Flame Spiders avoided Ascore (whose fell 
reputation has spread across the North) but set off to travel in a wide 
ring around it, taking note of any desert landmarks along the way. They 
soon caught sight of the city that held the Doom of the Desert -- too 
late to avoid being in turn seen and trapped by her. Iymrith placed no 
compulsions on the adventurers; she merely makes use of <i>mass teleport</i>
 spells to keep them inside a ring-shaped region of shifting sands 
around her city, plucking them unceremoniously back into it whenever 
they try to strike out into the desert or reach the city (which they've 
dubbed "the Towers Unattainable"). As long as they remain in this 
indefinite area of desert, Iymrith allows them to wander and act freely.
 Her gargoyles surreptitiously plant food and items for them to find 
(even shovels, when the desert storms expose interesting Netherese 
ruins) to keep them interested in their endless roamings. Whenever 
adventuring bands, Bedine, or other intruders dare to stray too close to
 her nameless city, Iymrith uses the Flame Spiders for the purpose for 
which she entrapped them: as unwitting defenders of her privacy, 
whisking them into confrontation with the newcomers.</p>
<p class="size2">Most Bedine attack the suddenly appearing Amnian 
warband on sight and fall prey to the spells the two Flame Spider mages 
can muster, but the Flame Spiders sometimes befriend intruders. <i>Mass teleport</i>
 spells and gargoyles prevent any invasion of the city on such 
occasions, but if no such activity is mounted, the Doom of the Desert 
uses her gargoyles to send out a feast, then employs spells to eavesdrop
 on any over-the-wine conversations, seeking to learn what the wider 
world knows of her as well as interesting news. Iymrith seems to have 
adopted the Flame Spiders as pets, in somewhat the same manner as 
soldiers' develop a casual affection for stray dogs, to whom they toss 
camp leavings. She uses her spells to snatch the Amnians apart from each
 other whenever their arguments break into open violence.</p>
<p class="size2">Most of the magical experimentations mounted by the 
blue dragon of the Chill Sands involve altering incantations to change 
spell effects; after centuries of doing this, she can tinker with spells
 instinctively and has been known to cast a spell in battle, observe its
 effect, and alter an immediate second casting to achieve a different 
result. Magic excites her, but challenges and danger (apparently) leave 
her icily calm; she has self-control far beyond what most dragons can 
conceive, let alone achieve.</p>
<p class="size2">When not altering or combining spells, Iymrith is 
usually attempting to infuse some part of an artificial draconic body 
with a magical property or power. The upper reaches of her central city 
chambers are crowded with floating sculpted stone body parts and 
more-or-less complete bodies. On several occasions spell 
experimentations that went awry have awakened these floating dragon 
fragments into wild eruptions of movement and magical power, 
slaughtering gargoyles and causing even lyrmith to retreat and blast 
anything that comes too close. A lurking Red Wizard deliberately caused 
one such burst of chaos some years ago, when Iymrith discovered him 
spying on her. He probably escaped her furious volley of spells, but 
less swift-to-flee mages (including an ambitious Brotherhood of the 
Arcane apprentice and several Zhentarim) have paid the ultimate price 
for daring to peer into the lair of the Doom of the Desert. Farscrying 
witnesses of at least two of these deaths have discerned a pattern to 
Iymrithian spell-duels, or at least a favorite attack method: The blue 
dragon likes to employ an <i>ice storm</i> or other area-effect damaging
 spell that lasts for more than a round and, while a foe is defending 
against it, launch a spell to destroy any protective shield they might 
raise. This attack is followed immediately by a spell designed forcibly 
to change their shape -- usually into something mute and immobile, such 
as a giant clam.</p>
<p class="size2">Iymrithian defenses can best be described as lax. She 
ignores attacks unless they thrust immediate consequences at her, 
whereupon she tends to hurl mobs of gargoyles at them and -- if she 
deems it necessary -- a few devastating spells or combinations of spells
 to defeat or disable the menace so that she can return her attentions 
to whatever she was doing when the danger arose. Foes (such as, on one 
recent and fatal occasion, an overconfident group of Sembian 
wizards-for-hire) who believe that such hasty reactions give them a 
weakness to readily exploit are correct, to a point -- but such bold 
foes had best do their exploiting very fast and very hard, or an aroused
 Iymrith will begin to unleash the full defenses of her city at them. In
 earlier days, she evidently placed belligerent creatures, from remorhaz
 to adventurers, in some sort of magical stasis, then stored them in 
sealed chambers, safe from hungry creatures, scouring sand, and the 
ravages of time. She can awaken groups of them en masse as she teleports
 them into the presence of a foe -- or to a position just above 
opponents, so as to bring them crashing down on the heads of such 
enemies.</p>
<p class="size2">The mage Tathtlan of Neverwinter, now deceased, discovered Iymrith early in his explorations with an ancient Netherese <i>scrying stone</i>
 and observed her often. His notes (from which much of what Elminster 
knows of the Doom of the Desert is derived; the Old Mage stresses that 
although it appears Iymrith became aware of her observer, she took no 
action against him and did not cause his demise) indicate that, from 
time to time, doorways and spires in the nameless city changed by 
themselves. Although their alterations may have been caused or triggered
 by the magical experiments of Iymrith, she was surprised by the changes
 on at least two occasions, and Tathtlan believes that some other force 
was, and is, awake and active in the city. Perhaps phaerimms are 
slipping some magic past the Doom of the Desert, or older resident magic
 or hidden beings are at work. These changes never seem to amount to a 
direct challenge to Iymrith, and their cause and true nature remain 
mysterious.</p>
<p class="size2">Tathtlan was of the opinion that Iymrith is growing 
more whimsical and carefree as she ages -- more caught up in the 
exultation of wielding magic and increasingly less caring of the world 
around her and of her own safety. He compared her behavior to that of 
some ancient elves, yearning for a oneness with magic that, legends 
whisper, led some of them to seek other forms of existence -- even, in 
some ironic cases, dragon-shape. Elminster believes that Iymrith's 
attempts to transfer her sentience from draconic body to body may have 
already led her close to a transcendent state of existence as a 
disembodied, mistlike flying spirit. Although she is yet a long way from
 preferring such a state to her familiar and powerful draconic form, the
 Old Mage believes, an attack that destroyed her body might not slay 
her, but might instead drive her into a wraithlike continued existence. 
Accordingly, he watches the future of the Doom of the Desert with 
interest.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Iymrith can breathe a 
120-foot line of electricity that deals 20d8 points of damage (Reflex DC
 33 half). Once she has used her breath weapon, she must wait 1d4 rounds
 before doing so again.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Crush:</b> When flying or jumping, Iymrith can land 
on opponents as a standard action, using her whole body to crush them. 
Her crush attacks are effective only against Medium-size or smaller 
opponents, though she can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks 
(grapple bonus +60) against larger opponents. A crush attack affects as 
many opponents of the appropriate size as can fit under her body. Each 
potentially affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 33) or 
be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage on 
that round and each round thereafter that the character remains pinned.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su): </b>This ability takes 
effect automatically when Iymrith attacks, charges, or flies overhead. 
It affects only opponents with 32 or fewer Hit Dice or levels within a 
radius of 300 feet. Each affected creature must make a successful Will 
save (DC 32) to resist the effect. On a failure, a creature with 5 or 
more Hit Dice or levels becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds, and a creature 
with 4 or fewer Hit Dice or levels becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds. 
Success indicates that the target is immune to Iymrith's frightful 
presence for one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- ventriloquism; 1/day -- hallucinatory terrain, veil. Caster level 20th; save DC 16 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells: </b>Iymrith can cast spells as a 20th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep:</b> Iymrith can sweep with her tail as a
 standard action. The sweep affects Small or smaller creatures within a 
half-circle with a diameter of 30 feet, centered on her rear. The sweep 
automatically deals 2d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 33 
half).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex): </b>Iymrith can ascertain creatures
 by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing 
vibration and other environmental clues) to a range of 300 feet. 
Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though she still can't discern
 ethereal beings. She usually does not need to make Spot or Listen 
checks to notice creatures within range of her blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Create/Destroy Water</i> (Sp):</b> Iymrith can use this ability three times per day. It works like the <i>create water</i>
 spell, except that she can decide to destroy water instead of creating 
it, which automatically spoils unattended liquids containing water. 
Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must 
succeed at a Will save (DC 32) or be ruined.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities:</b> Iymrith is immune to electricity, paralysis, and sleep.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Low-Light Vision: </b>Iymrith sees four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sound Imitation (Ex): </b>Iymrith can mimic any 
voice or sound she has heard, anytime she likes. A listener must succeed
 at a Will save (DC 32) to detect the ruse.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/8/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/6; save DC 16 + spell level): 0 -- <i>acid splash</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>arcane mark, dancing lights, detect magic, ghost sound, mage hand, open/close, ray of frost, read magic;</i> 1st -- <i>identify, jump, mage armor, spirit worm </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>true strike; </i>2nd -- <i>cat's grace, eagle's splendor </i>(<i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>), <i>endurance, Melf's acid arrow, shadow spray</i> (<i><b>Forgotten Realms </b>Campaign Setting</i>); 3rd -- <i>blacklight</i> (<i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>), <i>gaseous form, Mestil's acid breath</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>wind wall; </i>4th -- <i>flame sands</i>, <i>ice storm, polymorph other, scrying; </i>5th -- <i>Dhulark's glassstrike </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>magic jar, stone shape, teleport; </i>6th -- <i>chain lightning, control weather, greater dispelling; </i>7th -- <i>blasphemy, mass teleport</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>Presper's spell matrix </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>); 8th -- (unknown, presumably the gargoyle-creation spell), <i>horrid wilting, polymorph any object;</i> 9th -- <i>Alamanther's return</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>force burn, temporal stasis.</i></p>

<p class="size2"><b>Iymrith's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">From the ranks of the many spells wielded by the Doom 
of the Desert (who seems about the equivalent of a 20th-level sorcerer 
in terms of spellcasting ability, though she's never without a score or 
so of magic items that she can trigger at will), here are the spells 
that adventurers are likely to taste if they encounter any of her 
gargoyles, and the spell that has kept her alive in the face of phaerimm
 attacks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Flame Sands<br></b>Evocation [Fire]<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 4<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One creature (or area of water) per round<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude half (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You vomit forth nearly molten sand in a thin, forceful 
stream, attacking one target per round. Striking a target requires a 
ranged touch attack. The stream deals 1d6 points of fire damage per 
level (to a maximum of 15d6 for sorcerers and wizards, 10d6 for druids).</p>
<p class="size2">If the target fails its saving throw, its exposed 
equipment is also affected; all glass items break, reflective surfaces 
(such as mirrors) are dulled, and all gems and crystals become coated 
with sand (requiring 1 hour of work and a Craft (gemsmithing) check [DC 
15] to remove without damaging the gem). A successful saving throw 
halves the hit point damage and negates any of the spell's effects 
against equipment.</p>
<p class="size2">If fired at an area of water (excluding creatures made 
of water), the water boils into a momentary cloud of steam. The creature
 standing in the area of the targeted water must save as normal and all 
creatures within 5 feet of the target location must save for half 
damage, as well. If used in this way, the spell does not damage 
equipment. The boiling does not significantly reduce the volume of 
water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Force Burn<br></b>Evocation [Force]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 9<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One creature within a path 5 ft. long to the extent of the range<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (see text)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You create a glowing cylindrical bolt of force 5 feet 
wide and 10 feet long. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit with 
the bolt, but if you miss, you can attempt to strike successive 
creatures in the spell's path until you finally hit one.</p>
<p class="size2">A creature struck by the bolt suffers 1d6 points of 
force damage per two caster levels (maximum 25d6) and must succeed at a 
Will saving throw or lose 1d4 prepared spells or spell slots (each 
determined randomly). Spells or spell slots lost in this manner are 
available again after a normal period of rest. If a creature has fewer 
spells or spell slots remaining than the number rolled, this spell 
targets as many spells as it can and the extras are wasted. Only spells 
or spell slots belonging to the target can be lost this way; spells 
stored in items (including <i>spell storing</i> items or spell potential within a <i>rod of absorption</i>) are unaffected (note that <i>Presper's spell matrix</i> from <i>Magic of Faerûn</i> says that its spells are treated as prepared spells, so this spell can affect spells stored in a <i>matrix</i>).</p>
<p class="size2">For example, a cleric with a <i>lesser planar ally</i>, two <i>prayer</i>, and two <i>sanctuary</i> spells prepared fails his save against <i>force burn</i>.
 The dungeon master rolls a d4 and gets a 2, so the cleric will lose two
 spells. The DM then rolls a d4 twice to find the spell level of each 
spell, getting a 1 and a 4, so the cleric loses a <i>sanctuary</i> (level 1) and <i>lesser planar ally</i>
 (level 4). If the cleric had prepared different spells at level 1 
instead of multiples of the same spell, the DM would have determined 
randomly which 1st-level spell would be lost. Bards, sorcerers, and 
other casters that do not prepare spells lose available spell slots in 
the manner described above.</p>
<p class="size2">This spell was created specifically to affect 
phaerimms. A phaerimm struck by the bolt takes 1d6 points of force 
damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) and gets no spell resistance 
against this spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Iymrith's Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Doom of the Desert is unlikely to gain enough magic
 to feel secure, but if she can survive phaerimm attacks for another 
decade or so, she might master the ability to move at will from body to 
body; there are a few dracolich and mechanical monster bodies in Faerûn 
that she might seize.</p>
<p class="size2">This power would probably ensure her survival from a 
concerted phaerimm or dragon attack -- a good thing for her, because she
 would also almost certainly come to the attention of the Cult of the 
Dragon (as more than a dim legend of the North) and face well-organized 
attacks from multiple dracoliches acting in concert with other Cult 
forces. Elminster's money will, however, be on Iymrith in any such 
confrontation -- though he knows more than a few mages who'd like to 
watch.</p>

<p class="size2">Ed Greenwood (and his home) narrowly survived a recent 
visit from Elminster. He feels duty-bound to report that the Old Mage's 
newest favorite drink is the Amaretto Float (pralines'n'cream ice cream 
scoops dumped into the famous almond liqueur), and that Storm 
Silverhand's favorite color is royal blue -- and that her second 
favorite color is something she's decided to call "Ed's blush."</p>
