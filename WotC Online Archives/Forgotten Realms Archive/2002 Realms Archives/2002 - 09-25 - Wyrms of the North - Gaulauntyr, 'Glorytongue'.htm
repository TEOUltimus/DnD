<p class="size2">First mentioned in the Sword Coast Curiosities, 
Gaulauntyr is a mature adult topaz dragon of sinuous appearance. She has
 haunted the Sword Coast from Baldur's Gate to Luskan for the last 
century, and she moves about often to avoid other dragons, whom she has 
no interest in fighting. She prefers a life of stealth in and about 
human cities to the more typical -- for wyrms -- slumbering in a lair in
 the heart of a territory one dominates. </p>
<p class="size2">Authorities unanimously refer to this dragon as female 
and solitary. If she has ever taken a mate, history knows nothing of him
 or of his fate. </p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr is one of the most intelligent and paranoid 
dragons of the North. She almost always cloaks herself in illusory 
disguises and hides in forest glades, abandoned warehouses or ruins, or 
just under cover of darkness whenever possible. She's quite adept at 
landing softly atop the palaces and mansions of nobles, cautiously 
testing the roofs to see whether they'll bear her weight, then draping 
herself over them to be as hidden as possible from eyes watching either 
from below or from windows in the building itself. She then employs <i>remote viewing</i> and <i>unseen servant</i> powers, plus her <i>glorytongue</i> power, to pluck gems and magic items out of the building. </p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr is sometimes called "the Thief Dragon" 
because of her hunger for gems and the manner in which she has used 
spells, human hirelings, and stealth to steal gems from humans -- 
notably Waterdhavian nobles, but also jewelers and gem-merchants in 
Luskan and other places up and down the Sword Coast. Gaulauntyr's more 
familiar nickname, "Glorytongue," comes from her habit of delivering 
touch effects with her tongue after employing a 1st-level power, <i>glorytongue</i>, to make it a long, precise ribbon of flesh that can enter rooms via openings as small as a keyhole.</p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr's true success, however, comes from a magic item and her own sly wits. The item, <i>Jharakkan's Talon</i>,
 is a little-known draconic artifact of Faer√ªn. More importantly, her 
shrewd mind allows Gaulauntyr to understand the societies of Luskan, 
Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and Caer Callidyr, thus learning 
where gems and wealth may be found, and when they'll be most poorly 
guarded. She has learned the way both dragons and humans tend to think, 
allowing her to misdirect those folk of both races time and time again. </p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr often uses spells to lure or misdirect 
humans, employing such devices as the illusion of a beautiful human girl
 to give sobbing evidence or to distract pursuers. On one occasion, the 
Thief Dragon was lying in a stable yard, and she magically cloaked 
herself to appear as a fresh and steaming pile of manure, with her 
elongated <i>glorytongue</i> running through a cellar and up a 
heating-vent into a great bedchamber in an adjacent mansion. Guards were
 pounding on the door of the room, trying to reach its rightful occupant
 -- a noble lady whom Gaulauntyr was keeping bound, gagged, and stuffed 
above the canopy of her own bed with the dragon's <i>glorytongue</i>. 
The lady had struck an alarm-gong before being thus trapped, and the 
guards gave the dragon only a few minutes to think of something before 
they brought the door down. When they burst into the room at last, the 
astonished guards saw naked women diving out every window of the 
bedchamber, clutching their lady's gems and finery. When the men gave 
chase to the illusory thieves and the stolen treasure, Gaulauntyr 
stuffed the lady headfirst down her own garderobe to keep her quiet for a
 while, supervised an <i>unseen servant</i> while it tied up the best gems in some bed-linens, and rolled the bundle out a window. </p>
<p class="size2">The guard whom the falling gems almost hit had a few 
moments to stare at them before the dragon's tongue, emerging from the 
cellar, dealt him a spell that toppled him into slumber. The dragon 
snatched up the gems and took wing in the suddenly glowing guise of a 
red dragon with a certain and recognizable wizard riding a high saddle 
on its back, so that the crime would be blamed on someone else. </p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr spends her days watching (<i>remote viewing</i>,
 in most cases) human life up and down the Sword Coast, devising new 
ways to steal gems or, sometimes, food. She loves exotic cheeses and 
sauces, even though human portions give her only fleeting tastes of such
 delicacies. </p>
<p class="size2">Glorytongue's relationships with other dragons have 
been, in the words of the human sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate, "one 
long series of hurried escapes and misdirections." </p>
<p class="size2">The key to Gaulauntyr's character could be said to be 
her wry grasp of human and draconic nature, and the skill born of this 
that always keeps her thinking three steps ahead of opponents. She 
always has an escape route, a scheme to disappear or adopt a disguise, 
or a secondary plan for seizure of gems or goods if the first one fails.
 Often ending a secondary crime with a spectacular occurrence, such as 
pulling down a building, creates enough confusion that Gaulauntyr can 
pursue her original plan once more. </p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr is said to be an accomplished mimic of human
 voices and is very good at improvising interesting small talk to put in
 the mouth of one of her spell-images. Many dragons are said to be 
halfheartedly seeking her to recover the gems she has stolen, but 
Gaulauntyr seems to have no strong and persistent foes. The Cult of the 
Dragon would probably be deadly enemies to her if they knew just who was
 behind many of the thefts from their agents and treasuries that have 
occurred up and down the Sword Coast. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gaulauntyr's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Glorytongue makes her true lair in a many-armed 
tidewater cavern on the western face of a tiny island known as Alsapir's
 Rock, which was named for a long-ago fisherman who died when his boat 
was dashed apart against it during a storm. The Rock is so close to 
Mount Sar that it is ignored by most maps and charts. </p>
<p class="size2">Here she keeps the gems she steals, as well as a 
captive deepspawn, whose creatures can't escape from the caverns thanks 
to its watery entry. The monsters it births includes roth√©, deer, and 
boars, among other prey suitable for Gaulauntyr's appetite. The cavern 
lacks any food for these beasts, but Gaulauntyr usually devours them 
long before they have any chance to escape. </p>
<p class="size2">The lair has no known traps or notable features, but 
Gaulauntyr usually devours any humans who see its interior. She keeps 
her treasures hidden in crevices and on ledges behind large boulders 
that she rolls up to form a false wall. Thus, most intruders think the 
cavern ends where her heaped boulders begin. The Thief Dragon has no 
known servants or habitual accomplices or allies. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gaulauntyr's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From Alsapir's Rock, Gaulauntyr roams up and down the 
coast, usually keeping to the outward islets of the Moonshaes or the 
vicinity of Waterdeep, but sometimes working as far south as the 
Nelanther. Glorytongue is finding the City of Splendors and its environs
 increasingly crowded with various disguised dragons and other 
formidable spies and creatures of stealth. She makes fewer and less bold
 forays into its range than she once did. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Gaulauntyr </b></p>
<p class="size2">Although she customarily dines on what her captive 
deepspawn produces, Gaulauntyr favors wyverns, giant squids, and -- when
 she dares to attack them -- dragon turtles. She has almost died several
 times trying to slay dragon turtles. Once, during a storm, she 
succeeded in beaching one too far out of water for it to return, and she
 had a feast. </p>
<p class="size2">Gaulauntyr spends most days more lazily, using spells 
to spy on events up and down the coast. She has the strength to dive in 
and clamber out of the submerged mouth of her cavern in all but the 
worst storm weather or winter ice, and she is known to have some high 
meadows and desolate tors to rest upon when she can't return to her lair
 or doesn't want to lead pursuers to it. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gaulauntyr's Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">Glorytongue is not likely to have a long and uneventful
 life. Sooner or later, one of the wizards who dwell in the Sword Coast 
North will catch up with her. Alternatively, an attempted theft might go
 seriously wrong. The topaz dragon can be a fearsome foe in any battle, 
but if she's caught overextended, she could well be slain. </p>
<p class="size2">At least one elven mage of Evermeet is considering how 
Gaulauntyr's psionic powers could be manipulated so as to make her steal
 things upon command, thus providing the elven realm with an additional 
line of defense. In such a case, Gaulauntyr could deprive explorers bent
 on reaching the fabled Far Isle of the magic they need, or of masts and
 keeps for their boats, or she might merely distract them with the 
apparent rise of a persistent personal foe.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Gaulauntyr has one breath 
weapon: a 50-foot cone of dehydration that deals 14d8 points of damage 
(Reflex DC 27 half). Her breath looks like a watery blast. When directed
 against an aqueous liquid (water or a liquid consisting mainly of 
water), this effect evaporates 1 cubic foot of water per hit point of 
damage dealt.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Crush:</b> When flying or jumping, Gaulauntyr can 
land on opponents three or more size categories smaller than herself as a
 standard action, using her whole body to crush them. A crush attack 
affects as many creatures as can fit under her body. Each creature in 
the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 27) or be pinned. If
 Gaulauntyr chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple 
attack (grapple bonus +42). Each pinned creature automatically takes 
2d8+17 points of bludgeoning damage that round and each succeeding round
 that it remains pinned.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes 
effect automatically when Gaulauntyr attacks, charges, or flies 
overhead. It affects only opponents with 24 or fewer Hit Dice or levels.
 The affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 27) or 
become panicked (if 4 or fewer HD) or shaken (if more than 5 HD). 
Success indicates that the target is immune to Gaulauntyr's frightful 
presence for one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>3/day -- <i>fog cloud.</i> Caster level 9th; save DC 15 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Gaulauntyr can discern 
creatures and objects to a range of 210 feet by using nonvisual senses 
(mostly by hearing and scent, but also by vibration and other 
environmental clues). Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though 
Gaulauntyr still can't discern ethereal beings. Gaulauntyr usually does 
not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range 
of her blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities:</b> Gaulauntyr is immune to cold, sleep, and paralysis effects. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Gaulauntyr has darkvision (700-foot range) and low-light vision that allows her to see four times better than a human.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Psionics (Sp):</b> Gaulauntyr can use psionics as a 9th-level psion (egoist). She can also use the psionic power <i>feather fall </i>twice per day as a spell-like ability (manifester level 9th).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Water Breathing (Ex): </b>Gaulauntyr can breathe water as readily as air.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Psionic Powers Known </b>(save DC = d20 + power level + key ability modifier): 0 -- <i>daze, far hand, finger of fire, missive, my light, verve; </i>1st -- <i>conceal thoughts, empathy, glorytongue, unseen servant </i>(as the spell, but a metacreative power); 2nd -- <i>body adjustment, claws of the bear, knock; </i>3rd -- <i>displacement, false sensory input, remote viewing;</i> 4th -- <i>dimension door, psychofeedback.</i></p>

<p class="size2">The topaz dragon is detailed in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88268">Monster Manual II</a></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88268">.</a></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gaulauntyr's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">One power devised by Gaulauntyr appears hereafter, but her mightiest magic is <i>Jharakkan's Talon</i>, a draconic artifact she wears at all times. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Jharakkan's Talon</b></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Jharakkan's</i><i>Talon</i> is really a 
talon-sheath: a hollow cone of black horn from some unknown creature. It
 is very hard and tough, so most blows don't even mark it. The <i>Talon</i>
 is 8 inches long, and is large enough to fit over the end of a dragon's
 own talon. It has a pierced end, so the real talon protrudes through 
it, allowing the dragon to make claw attacks normally while wearing it.</p>
<p class="size2">The <i>Talon</i> is named for Jharakkan, a 
dragon-sorcerer who created it long ago. (No one alive is sure where or 
when.) Old legends recorded in books kept at Candlekeep say that 
Jharakkan was a black wyrm who lived for over 4,000 years and devised 
many magic items. No other evidence supports these tales, however, and 
some theorize that these tales are simply an exaggerated retelling of 
another tale, and so on. </p>
<p class="size2">The <i>Talon</i> was found about 60 summers ago by 
Gaulauntyr on the skeleton of a drowned dragon that was just off the end
 of the island of Highport in the Moonshaes. The skeleton might have 
been the remains of the red dragon known as Ualintharghar the Devouring 
Flame, of whom the Ffolk tell wild tales. </p>
<p class="size2">Other creatures (such as humanoids) that cannot wear the <i>Talon</i> can still employ its powers simply by touching it.</p>
<p class="size2">Certain organizations (such as the Zhentarim, the Red 
Wizards, the Arcane Brotherhood, and the Cult of the Dragon) would be 
very interested in acquiring the <i>Talon</i> to see whether its powers 
could be unraveled and adapted to the creation of items that would 
temporarily allow underlings to cast a few minor spells so as to aid in 
attacks, though it will probably drain the lives of those unfortunates 
in the process. </p>
<p class="size2">Holding or wearing the <i>Talon</i> allows any arcane spellcaster to cast six additional spells per day, with one coming from levels 1 through 6, similar to a <i>ring of wizardry</i>'s
 ability to grant additional spell slots. The item must be held or worn 
to provide these additional slots; it cannot be used to prepare 
additional spells and then left behind. It does not allow a caster to 
use spells they could not normally use (so a 1st-level wizard could not 
use the <i>Talon</i> to prepare a 6th-level spell, but she could use the higher-level slots to prepare lower-level spells).</p>
<p class="size2">However, the <i>Talon</i> bears a curse: Every time one
 of the extra slots is used to cast (but not prepare) a spell, the 
artifact deals 1d6 points of damage to the user. This damage does not 
disrupt the caster's concentration and does not require any special 
magic to heal.</p>
<p class="size2">Several stories exist about how to destroy this artifact, if one were so inclined.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Talon</i> must be immersed in the blood of at least a dozen kinds of true dragons within the same month. <br><br></li>
<li>The <i>Talon</i> must be struck by a <i>rod of negation</i> while it is in contact with six <i>rings of wizardry</i>. All items would be destroyed along with the <i>Talon</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b>Glorytongue<br></b>Psychometabolism (Str)<br><b>Level:</b> Psion 1<br><b>Display:</b> Ma<br><b>Manifestation Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<b><br></b><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)<br><b>Power Points:</b> 1</p>
<p class="size2">You gain the ability to stretch your tongue great distances and manipulate it as if it were a true limb. </p>
<p class="size2">The tongue is treated as a Diminutive construct with 
1/2 HD, hit points equal to half your maximum hit points, AC 13 (+4 
size, -1 Dex), Strength 1, Dexterity 8, Con --, Int --, Wis 1, Cha 1. It
 uses your base attack bonus to touch, grab, or attack, but it does not 
threaten an area and deals no damage with its attacks. It is fully under
 your control and can manipulate objects like a tentacle. You can use 
the <i>glorytongue</i> to deliver touch spells. You can cause it grow 
(up to 100 feet long) or shrink (to its normal size) as a free action. 
It does not interfere with spellcasting or speaking. It can be used to 
make grapple checks, although its weak Strength makes it difficult to 
actually grapple a creature. It can wind its way up ropes, walls, and 
other vertical surfaces, and it is strong enough to suspend up to 10 
feet of itself free of any supporting surface (to cross a pit, for 
example).</p>
<p class="size2">The end of the tongue is a primitive sensory organ and 
can see up to 5 feet away with normal vision. (It does not have 
blindsight, darkvision, or low-light vision). You perceive everything 
the tongue perceives. Because it is an extension of your tongue, you can
 use it to taste things, although poisons and harmful effects do not 
transmit to you through the <i>glorytongue</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">If destroyed, all but the original length of tongue that existed before the <i>glorytongue</i> power was used collapses into dust.</p>
