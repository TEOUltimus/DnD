<p>One of three tiny realms named for their common origin, High Mukshar 
is a land of rocky outcrops, high, rolling meadows, and rubblestone 
walls between fields, where sheep farming predominates. Many a traveler 
has become lost in its winding lanes and dense woodlots and heartily 
cursed the place. More than a few outlanders have gone astray, been 
forced to camp in the uplands when darkness came, and vanished forever.</p>
<p>Border wisdom says able and well-armed brigands shelter in old, 
played-out gold and copper mines in the mountains along the realm's 
western border. The human, gnome, halfling, and half-elven inhabitants 
of High Mukshar know this to be true -- all except the "played-out" 
part. Despite the presence of murderous outlaws dwelling in some of the 
old mines and preying on passersby, many High Muksharran would take up 
their picks to mine mule-loads of gold but for the deadly presence of 
mysterious monsters High Muksharran call "the Others." These hunt the 
highlands and long ago forced abandonment of all three villages in the 
realm. Despite this, more gold and copper still come out of High Mukshar
 than out of all the western Heartlands, but in a slow trickle of 
muleloads, not by gangs of slaves or near-slaves, mages blasting the 
rocks with spells, and lines of wagons waiting to take the ore away.</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2012-06%20-%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20High%20Mukshar_files/dnd_frbk_20061206_himuk.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="227" width="325">The
 overgrown ruins of the three villages still provide shelter and good 
wells to any daring to camp there. They are: Tleska, at the mouth of the
 Tumblestone River, where the crumbling Battleshield Bridge carries the 
coastal road across its waters; Longsword, where three trails meet and a
 lone, fortified inn and smithy (Thorn's Smithy) still operates; and 
Ramshead, high in the mountains at the foot of the distinctive peak 
known as the Broken Helm.</p>
<p>Most High Muksharran (humans, gnomes, halflings, and half-elves) 
avoid the mountains and spend their nights in fortified caves and old 
cellars with barricaded entrances and armed men standing watch, their 
spears and crossbow bolts coated with blue whinnis sleep-poison or pitch
 for fiery use. They only that their foes are man-eating creatures that 
can assume the shapes of friends and loved ones. This is why travelers 
asking for night shelter are always very closely watched by numerous 
well-armed warriors.</p>
<p>The Others are in fact druuth -- bands of four to six dopplegangers, 
each led by a lone illithid. (Elminster of Shadowdale terms these 
still-generally-unknown perils "the rising scourge of the Realms," and 
claims they are all-too-common in the lands south of the Shaar and the 
Dustwall. Thankfully, they are still rare elsewhere.)</p>
<p>At least four druuth uneasily share High Mukshar, raiding stealthily 
into nearby realms (employing disguises and striking seldom, to escape 
as much notice as possible). They work together against intruding 
adventuring bands. They've struck and slain far afield in other Border 
lands, preying on High Muksharran as little as possible because nearby 
cattle are easy meat. Muksharran victims, they believe, should be saved 
for bad weather, hard winters, and other times when hunting is 
difficult, uncomfortable, or dangerous.</p>
<p>This working truce was arrived at after a series of bloody battles 
destroyed at least another three druuth. One of the present groups was 
formed out of the fragments of two or more others. When adventuring 
bands intrude into the monster-haunted mines or the high meadows, two or
 more druuth often combine to attack them, sometimes slaughtering the 
survivors when they're too tired to fight on and haven't enough strength
 left to mount a watch while part of the band sleeps. Druuth are named 
for their leaders; of the High Mukshar bands, "Sshreea" and "Oinuth" 
(probably illithid nicknames) are known.</p>
<p>High Mukshar was not always thus. Twenty winters ago, it boasted a 
Lord of the Realm in Tleska and two High Knights (one in each of the two
 upland villages). These three men were all retired adventurers or 
warriors from Tethyr who liked to wear splendid armor and canter fine 
horses along the trails of the realm with boarspear-wielding riders as 
escorts. The druuth made sure they died first -- slain in their beds, 
lords and armsmen both, until no man who'd ever fought for a living was 
still alive in the land. The body count to reach that undefended state 
was less than thirty.</p>
<p>A company of adventurers arrived soon after that, but once stripped 
of their mage and priests (a task involving one night's work by 
dopplegangers shifted into the shapes of attractive women backed by 
strangling tentacles), the dozen swords mustered by the Brave and Bold 
of Bedorn didn't last long.</p>
<p>The Company of the Tristar Lance out of Baldur's Gate and thirsty for
 "the gold and gems that spill out of every cupboard and cottage in the 
Border Kingdoms" was next to arrive and fall. When a caravan of 
ironmongery disappeared, word of "the fell doings in High Muk" finally 
began spreading around the Border Kingdoms. After that, new arrivals 
became few and far between.</p>
<p>The druuth decided more subtlety was in order and began the careful 
series of expeditions they continue to this day. They've struck and 
slain as far afield as Oparl and the Duskwood and even spent almost an 
entire year hunting in Jundarwood. During this time they left the High 
Muksharran alone so they would gain false hope and begin once more to 
hunt for gold and graze their flocks on the highest meadows.</p>
<p>Yet fear and sorrow ride the Muksharran. They recall Lord Baelim, 
"the Laughing Lord," and his three fair ladies with the long, streaming 
hair. They remember the tall and noble Athkontan, High Knight of 
Longsword, and the short, stout, lusty Baerben "Three Tankards" Nuim, 
High Knight of Ramshead. They whisper of the Others that slew them and 
lurk even now in their land, able to "wear the masks" of folk and so get
 close enough to rend with claws and thrust with spikes of bone. They 
wonder who these Others are, why they came to High Mukshar, and who 
might be powerful enough to destroy them.</p>
<p>Three Harper bands have tried and failed to cleanse the realm. One 
Harper, out of all those fair folk, survived. She is given to bouts of 
weeping madness and now keeps to the inner rooms of Twilight Hall. One 
Red Wizard of Thay, hoping that the Others had magic he could seize, 
came to the realm with ready spells. He was slain in his sleep, seeing 
no approaching foe in his dreams.</p>
<p>The closest thing High Mukshar has to a ruler today is the smith at 
Longsword, Draldimor Thorn (LN male Illuskan human Ftr9; Str 18, Con 
17). He is tall, stout-muscled, and humorless, but has a very firm sense
 of law, order, and right. He trains all of the folk of his stockaded 
household at arms and warily plies his trade with the few travelers to 
come through the realm. Under his hearthstone lie 302,800 pieces of 
gold, amassed from the sale of gold nuggets and from smithing down the 
years. He will give it all to any adventurers who rid the realm of the 
Others and let High Mukshar rise again.</p>
<p>Right now, a traveler can get provender (cheese, bread, small beer, 
and stew) at two farms near Tleska and at Thorn's Smithy in Longsword. 
The only inn and tavern still operating in High Mukshar face each other 
across the coastal road east of the Tumblestone, close enough to Middle 
Mukshar that the river is only a silver ribbon in the distance. They are
 The Wailing Wolf tavern (Fair/Cheap) and Anglabur's Haven inn 
(Good/Moderate). Both of them have fenced lands, castle-like walls, and 
over twenty wary guards each. Both have recently been touched by 
suspicion and fear, as the druuth (catching men alone and using the 
guises of their comrades) have begun to slay the best warriors of the 
guards.</p>
<p>The realm has few landmarks beyond the aforementioned Broken Helm (a 
riven mountain whose north flank is rounded and conical but that falls 
away to the south in sheer cliffs) and the Rise, an isolated hill 
traversed on three sides by the Tumblestone River. Its crest sports an 
ancient, ring-shaped fort (the base of a long-fallen tower), and from 
its stones one can look clear across neighboring Nether Mukshar.</p>
<p>Unless one enjoys battling monsters (they swarm in some of the mines 
almost as thickly as folk tales say they do) or thinks that easy gold 
can be had by anyone daring enough to ride in and scoop it up (false, 
unless "scoop it up" refers to tons of raw ore), there's little reason 
to visit High Mukshar now. At least one of its mines (Ilthamar's Delve, 
in the heart of the southernmost mountains of the realm) descends to 
meet passages in the Underdark, which ultimately link up with the Deep 
Realm of the dwarves. As the ballad goes, "There are faster and easier 
ways to meet one's doom" than descending a mine in the backlands of High
 Mukshar.</p>
<p>Adventurers who enter High Mukshar will find welcomes -- of sorts -- from the Muksharran . . . and the Others.</p>
<p>Settlements: None.</p>
