<p><i>Ahh, yes, the Border Kingdoms. I was born there -- in a little 
cottage built into the shoulder of a flower-girt hill in High Emmerock. I
 destroyed the place with my first </i>fireball<i> spell, of course.</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Jalankhan Harmister, Archmage of Lyrabar<br> in a talk at an Inner Sea Conclave, Year of the Prince</p>
<p>High Emmerock is, as its name suggests, a region of high, grassy 
meadows suited for grazing livestock. One of the more prosperous Border 
Kingdoms, it is unusually verdant. (A property born of magical causes, 
some locals believe. That belief has persisted, it should be noted, down
 many centuries.) As a result, it has always provided ample grazing, and
 so has teemed with wild beasts.</p>
<p>After the dragons that ruled it perished battling each other, the 
lesser beasts they fed upon flourished. Giants moved in to rule and 
defend this gigantic "food pen" against goblins, orcs, and other 
predators. </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-08%20-%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20High%20Emmerock%20pt.%201_files/dnd_frbk_20061108a_emmer.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="227" width="325">Under
 their husbandry, the edible grazing animals grew even more numerous. 
Some three centuries ago, Calishite adventurers came exploring. Finding 
wild horses of superb quality in the high meadows, the humans set about 
exterminating the giants. </p>
<p>From that time on, the Sward (as those first Calishite explorers 
called the meadows) has served certain Calishite horse-dealers as a 
secret breeding ground. Both to camouflage their best stock and to use 
every inch of grazing land, the breeders hunted down as many predators 
as they could and put in their place horned cattle, sheep, and goats. 
These swiftly multiplied, and their increasing numbers led to a 
proliferation of rustlers, monsters -- and mercenary guards hired by the
 distant Calishite stock-owners to deal with both sorts of raiders. </p>
<h4>Tyrant Rule</h4>
<p>The loyalty of such hirelings in turn became a problem. After several
 minor defiances, there came outright rebellion -- the leader of the 
Unsleeping Eye Guardians, the warrior Ithkyl Halgart, decided to declare
 the Sward his own kingdom. </p>
<p>Halgart, an experienced and well-prepared warrior who employed 
pitfall traps, retreats into the nearby woods (and, some say, mysterious
 magical aid) to advantage, won a series of bitter battles with forces 
sent by Calishite satraps who disagreed with the notion of paying for 
beasts that they considered their own. The armies came in earnest for 
three seasons and were followed by sporadic expeditions of hired mages 
and renowned adventuring bands in the decade that followed -- but 
Halgart prevailed. </p>
<p>His end came after seventeen summers of ruling his realm from a cave 
stronghold (today a monster-haunted labyrinth of chambers and natural 
caverns known as "the Ghostways"). A rapacious blue dragon descended on 
the realm, dining at will on the Sward's best horseflesh. </p>
<p>The Lord of the Sward rode out to do battle with it and was torn limb
 from limb for his troubles. The wyrm died under repeated volleys of 
fire arrows at the hands of Halgart's men and was cooked and eaten at 
the Lord's funeral feast. </p>
<p>After the Lord's death, the watching Calishites expected the 
fledgling realm to fall apart in the inevitable struggle for the throne 
among Halgart's underlings. But a warrior named Maeradyn swiftly and 
ruthlessly took power, and the Sward survived. </p>
<p>So the Calishites watched and waited for the new Lord's rule to fail.
 When it continued on, they sent more hired armies to smash Maeradyn's 
troops. The fast-riding Swardar met them with deadly arrow-volleys, 
striking swiftly and racing on before the larger, better-equipped 
Calishite forces could strike camp and respond. Whenever the Swardar 
were brought to bay, giants appeared out of thin air, as if by magic, to
 pounce on the Calishite forces. Soon the satraps grew tired of throwing
 away money on armed hosts whose few survivors brought back only news of
 futility. They abandoned their efforts to reconquer the Sward. </p>
<p>Over the years that followed, a succession of fiercely independent 
local rulers kept the realm strong. They used the money gained from the 
sale of their famous horses and lesser livestock to carefully build, 
equip, and train an elite force of mounted crossbowmen and lancers to 
guard the herds and horse-meadows. </p>
<p>Priests of Helm were encouraged to settle in the realm and guard its 
borders, as were adventurers who wanted a safe haven to dwell in -- 
provided they agreed to submit to the worship and instruction of the 
Helmite clergy. The famous Company of Sun Knights adventuring band did 
so, retiring to the Sward at the end of a long and colorful career to 
found the now equally famous Sunbright Lances of the realm. </p>
<p>The Lances are heavily armored men of great height and strength. 
Their massed charge can smash aside and trample most foes, and their 
almost fanatical commanders train the Lances in fighting in swamps, 
rainstorms, thick forest, blizzards, and mud while both mounted and 
afoot. They become adept at shedding armor while in battle or on the 
move if need be and in anticipating and reacting to enemy tricks. After a
 century of such training and victory after victory in battle against 
various ambitious neighbors, the Lances are widely feared in the Border 
realms. Very few folk dare to trifle with the laws and peace of High 
Emmerock. </p>
<h4>The Emmerock Dynasty</h4>
<p>The present name of the realm comes from one of its most famous kings
 -- Emmerock the Goblinbane, who hunted orcs, goblins, and their kin as 
some men hunt stags in the forest, until the enraged goblins mustered an
 army from their usually-feuding tribes (who dwelt in the land that 
today is Thuntar) and invaded the Sward. They chased Swardar patrols who
 'fled' into the deep ravine at the heart of the realm, leading the 
goblin army into a waiting trap. There, with the Lake in the Cleft 
glimmering before them, the goblins died in their thousands, beset from 
all sides by the rolled rocks, hurled lances, and fired arrows of the 
Swardar. </p>
<p>A day after the goblin army was eradicated, the Swardar charged down 
into the goblin lands to the southwest. Goblin warrens were surrounded, 
haycarts set ablaze and pushed into the tunnels, and the goblins were 
smoked out to their deaths in the face of withering arrow-volleys. When 
all of the goblinkin had been hunted down, the King declared that the 
Sward would henceforth be known as High Emmerock and the goblin lands as
 Low Emmerock. </p>
<p>Emmerock then sired three sons, all as hard-driving and ambitious as 
their sire. Almost thirty summers later, the eldest murdered him for the
 crown -- and was executed by the shocked younger brothers, who then 
promptly went to war with each other over who should rule the realm. The
 son known as Esbolder prevailed, proclaiming himself King and banishing
 his younger brother, Nothlan, to everlasting exile. </p>
<p>Nothlan went straight to Calimshan and offered certain horse-breeding
 families there a chance to own part of the fabled Land of Horses again 
if they'd back him in a bid to regain the throne. They did. </p>
<p>Nothlan's forces landed in Low Emmerock only to find the Emmeran 
armies waiting for them. The struggle that followed ravaged both armies 
and went on until a harsh winter forced the survivors to stop fighting 
and scrabble to survive. </p>
<p>At some time during the dark, chilly depths of that cold season, 
Nothlan vanished. Some say he was murdered by his brother (or an 
adventuring band hired by the King), others that he simply froze to 
death and was devoured by wolves before his body could be found and 
identified. Still other folk whispered that he blundered through a 
magical portal into "another place," never to return. Minstrels sing of 
the day when a son of Nothlan, "the rightful king of all Emmerock," will
 come "striding out of nowhere" to reclaim his realm. A few folk insist 
Nothlan sickened of the whole affair and went away to take up a life of 
devotion to a peaceful god or study at Candlekeep. </p>
<p>Whatever Nothlan's true fate, spring found his army reduced to 
handfuls of scattered, fleeing warriors and Low Emmerock a lawless, 
ravaged land. The surviving warriors of High Emmerock were unable to 
hold it. All their attention was needed to defend the original 
meadowland realm against wave after wave of opportunistic invaders. </p>
<p>It was then that the Company of Sun Knights, who'd been landholders 
in the realm for more than a decade but spent most of their time off 
adventuring, came to home to stay. Under their competent leadership, 
High Emmerock survived, but its forces were never able to retake their 
former sister realm (which is today the land of Thuntar). The best they 
could manage was holding this or that small piece of it for scattered 
days or months at a time. </p>
<p>The last King of the Emmerock dynasty, Belder the Sly, perished in 
1344 of a bloating plague while wenching in the port cities of the Lake 
of Steam. With his death, High Emmerock slid peacefully under the rule 
of a council of seven warrior lords (the descendants of the Sun 
Knights). Their policies ensured that Emmerans would stop trying to 
regain Low Emmerock and instead concentrate on improving their homeland.
 </p>
<p>They succeeded. Today, High Emmerock is a well-ordered, 
heavily-policed land that resembles nothing so much as a huge farm in 
which stock is reared, lands are carefully irrigated and trimmed, and 
patrols are frequent and vigilant. The towers of the Lords of the Lances
 ring the land (visitors seeking accommodation or trade are advised to 
go to the markets, taverns, shops, and inns that cluster about each 
tower), and its interior consists of rolling, open grasslands still 
known as the Sward. </p>
