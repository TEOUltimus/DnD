<p align="left"><i>Can you trust the words of a traitor? Would you dare 
put your fate in the hands of someone who has turned their colors and 
switched sides? Would you risk the fate of a town and everyone in it on a
 change of heart? High Lord Kalahar Twohands decided that he could not.</i></p>
<p align="right">Teseryne Truesilver<br> Daughter of Talanthe Truesilver<br> Year of Rogue Dragons</p>
<p align="left">Shortly after the Jade Blade had rescued Baern Karneme, 
they were asked to meet with a secret benefactor at an elegant home in 
the High Town neighborhood of Loudwater. Curious at who this could be, 
they arrived and were shown to the library where they were met by High 
Lord Kalahar Twohands. He wanted to meet with them secretly in case the 
Zhentarim have spies in the High Hall.</p>
<p align="left">Kalahar wanted our heroes to follow up on the report 
made by Baern. As I mentioned in my previous tale "The Truth of Hearts,"
 Baern was a spy for the Zhentarim who had had switched his allegiance 
to Loudwater, and the Jade Blade had rescued him from a Zhentarim 
assassination attempt. He warned the High Lord that the Zhentarim were 
planning an invasion of Loudwater in the immediate future.</p>
<p align="left">Kalahar wanted the Jade Blade to follow up on Baern's 
warning and confirm whether his tale was true. They were to travel to 
Llorkh, the anchor of the Zhentarim presence in the eastern Delimbiyr 
Vale, and determine if the Zhentarim were preparing an invasion and to 
find out as much information as possible. This reconnaissance was needed
 as quickly so the Jade Blade quickly gathered their weapons and 
equipment and headed out into the summer night.</p>
<p align="left">Leaving Loudwater unnoticed was easily accomplished with
 the help of the town guard. The Jade Blade traveled east along the edge
 of the South Wood for the next several days. They passed Orlbar in the 
night, without encountering opposition, and entered the 
Zhentarim-controlled open plains between Orlbar and Llorkh. Zhentarim 
patrols scoured the countryside, looking for scouts from Loudwater, but 
the Jade Blade moved stealthy past them and made their way to Llorkh.</p>
<p align="left">When they reached Llorkh, our heroes took several hours 
to examine its defenses. The town was surrounded by a deep ditch and a 
palisade. Small camps of soldiers were set up to the south and east of 
town, housing garrison appropriate for a town the size of Llorkh. The 
adventurers did notice activity in the hills, suggesting that some of 
the mines were in operation.</p>
<p align="left">After much observation and consideration, the Jade Blade
 snuck into Llorkh by climbing over the wall using magic and stealth. 
They escaped the notice of the sentries on the wall and blended with the
 local population once they were inside the town. To gather information,
 they visited several taverns that were popular with soldiers and 
caravan drivers, including Ten Bells, the Drover's Cup, and the Wet 
Wizard. Listening to the locals and asking the right questions, they 
learned that the mines near Llorkh were thought to have played out, but 
operations in several of them had started back up again. In addition, 
the number of caravans to town had greatly increased recently. Armed 
with this information, they bribed with drinks one of the teamsters who 
had come to town with a caravan the day before. His caravan had 
delivered a load of supplies to the newly opened mine, but thought that 
it was strange how the miners didn't seem to be doing anything and 
insisted on unloading everything themselves, instead of letting the 
teamsters do it.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade's curiosity toward the mines grew, and 
they got directions from the teamster before he passed out. Instead of 
barging head-on into the reopened mines, our heroes snuck into an 
abandoned entrance nearby, hoping that it would interconnect with the 
active mines. Their hope was correct but a pair of ropers that had made 
the abandoned mine their home. The adventures quickly dealt with these 
aberrations and found a passage that wound deeper underground and 
eventually connected with the reopened mines.</p>
<p align="left">It quickly became obvious to the Jade Blade that these 
mines were not in operation at all. Instead, they were housing hundreds 
Zhentarim warriors and dozens of devils. The "miners" were not digging 
for ore but carving out new chambers to hold even more troops! Our 
heroes knew it would be suicide to directly attack that many soldiers so
 they snuck about the mines, keeping to the shadows and picking off a 
handful of guards. Using this tactic they made their way to the 
officer's quarters at the heart of the mines. Inside, they surprised 
Grei Lorlarr, the Zhentarim commander of the mine, and Shierana, her 
erinyes aide-de-camp. The two leaders leapt to defend themselves against
 the Jade Blade. Grei had a special hatred for spellcasters and attacked
 the party's wizard with a savage fury. Shierana used her fiendish 
powers to demoralize the rest of the adventures before switching to her 
wicked bow. Fortunately, the Jade Blade managed to Grei before she could
 sound the alarm, but Shierana teleported away to summon help.</p>
<p align="left">Quickly searching through Grei's correspondence, the 
Jade Blade found detailed information on the number of soldiers hidden 
in the mines and the supplies needed for them, maps of Loudwater with 
important buildings and defensive structures noted, and a timetable for 
the arrival of thousand more troops at the mines. The timetable stopped 
two months in the future without explanation. A dread realization 
settled over our heroes as they realized why there were no further 
entries. The troops would not be there.</p>
<p align="left">Avoiding the troops summoned by Shierana, the Jade Blade
 crept out of the mines and headed back to Loudwater. High Lord Kalahar 
was stoic as he heard the news confirming an attack on the City of 
Grottos. War was indeed coming, but at least now Loudwater knew when it 
was coming and what the Zhentarim had in store. The Jade Blade rose even
 higher in High Lord Kalahar's esteem, and he would call upon them again
 in the coming months.</p>
