<p align="left"><b>The blue mists fell away once more, leaving the king and queen standing together in chill, clinging gray-white fog.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>"I begin to like this less and less," Filfaeril 
announced firmly. "Can't you work Vangey's device so as to take us 
straight back home?"</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>"A moment, dearest," the Dragon of Cormyr replied, 
striding a few steps across the dark planks underfoot. A drift of mist 
swallowed him, and his queen had to run to keep him from entirely 
disappearing from view.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>She found him standing at a low, stout wooden rail, 
of strangely fluted, ornate design. A ship's rail. Azoun was peering 
over the edge, crouching low to guard against overbalancing -- though 
the ship seemed rock-steady beneath them -- and nodding rather grimly.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>"Where <i>are</i> we?" the Dragon Queen demanded, 
rubbing her shoulder against his in the unspoken signal that she wanted 
him to put a comforting arm around her. He obliged. "A ship, so much is 
obvious, but I feel no sea beneath us, hear no waves -- <i>smell</i> no waves!"</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>"'Twould be a surprise if you did, Fee," her husband 
replied, pointing at a sudden gap in the fog, that opened on a glimpse 
of treetops, "being as we're sailing on air."</b></p>
<p align="left">Everyone in the Heartlands of the Realms, and anyone who
 betimes visits a tavern elsewhere in Faerûn, too, has heard of the 
"Lost Ship."</p>
<p align="left">The tales told of it are many, colorful, and 
contradictory, but all agree that for years it has been sailing the 
skies of the Realms, hither and yon, flying low and silent yet never 
seeming to run into trees, the spires of tall keeps, or mountainsides.</p>
<p align="left">Some say it's a trap for spellcasters, a lure whereby 
wraith-wizards of ancient Netheril, who haunt it, drain the lives or 
possess the bodies or steal the spells of any mages foolhardy enough to 
venture aboard. Others say it's a haunted ship of insane, despairing 
undead who endlessly flee something even more terrible that pursues them
 through the skies. Still others believe it's a disguised creche for 
dragon eggs, girded about with spells to snare and capture adventurers 
to be food for hungry hatchlings. Or it may be the abandoned home of a 
god, or a huge sentient monster masquerading as a ship, or a magical 
temple stolen from its rightful place by now-cursed thieves, now adrift 
in the skies. Some say pirates dwell aboard, dropping down on long lines
 to raid and plunder, only to be picked up again tendays or months 
later. There are almost as many tales as there are tellers, each one 
wild and strange, yet . . . fascinating.</p>
<p align="left">Elminster, of course, knows rather more about it, though even he doesn't know how it came to fly endlessly, and to what purpose.</p>
<p align="left">"The Lost Ship" bears no name on its counter or bows 
beyond a few recent, fanciful, and largely defaced scribblings ("Sky 
Witch," "Laeroth's Revenge," and "Dire Queen" are but three). This 
skyship (as described in "Sailors on the Sea of Air" in issue #124 of <b>Dragon</b> Magazine), is possibly of early Halruaan build, and it has been sailing for centuries.</p>
<p align="left">In appearance, the flying ship is ghostly gray, 
darkening to a deep brown underneath (where the wooden hull is exposed),
 with upperworks largely clad in a smooth, seamless layer of (unknown, 
but inert, nonferrous, and seemingly useless) gray metal as soft as 
soap, that can be scraped away but promptly melts into air, and has no 
strength at all. Its yards (ropes) seem to be "normal" heavy hemp but 
are a matching gray in hue -- as are its sails, which are largely in 
tatters. Its rigging is, or appears to once have been, what our real 
world would term that of a "brigantine:" two masts, with four 
square-rigged sails on the foremast, three jibs (triangular sails) 
between that mast and the bowsprit, another two jibs between the 
foremast and the mizzenmast, and on that mizzen, a large gaff surmounted
 by two square-rigged topsails. Streamers of torn sail and detached 
ropes sway, flutter, and dangle everywhere, without responding to the 
"wind" of the ship's passage or prevailing breezes around it, and the 
ruinous nature of this rigging seems to have no effect on the way the 
ship sails.</p>
<p align="left">The Lost Ship has a low-profile, slender hull, with a 
raised-four-steps foredeck in the bows and a raised-seven-steps poop 
(small aft) deck. Cabins with windows, bunk beds, chart tables, and 
chairs are beneath both raised decks, and hatches in the cabin floors 
and in the main deck adjacent to the cabins lead down into a long, low 
hold that over the centuries has accumulated quite a collection of 
murdered passengers and their (picked-over, worthless) moldering 
belongings. (As Elminster wryly observed, the chief cargo carried by the
 ghostly vessel seems to be all the fanciful tales folk spin about it.)</p>
<p align="left">Under the hold is a bilge full of black, ill-smelling 
ancient water that is tainted with a many-times-cast magical curse. 
Anyone foolish enough to drink more than a few drops (enough to fill a 
potion bottle or flask) turns into a gray render. The physical change 
takes 4+1d4 hours; after the form is fully assumed, treat the victim as 
if it had received the effects of an alternate form effect (see page 305
 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>, plus its most <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20040125a">recent errata</a>
 that lasts for 1d8 days. Beings who sample mere drops immediately feel 
stiff and numb, taking a -1 penalty to Dexterity. Additionally, the 
victim's skin turns a light shade of gray, but this condition passes off
 in 4+1d4 hours.</p>
<p align="left"><i>There's obviously a lot more to learn about the Lost 
Ship, and our next column will explore as much as is known. Lucky Azoun
