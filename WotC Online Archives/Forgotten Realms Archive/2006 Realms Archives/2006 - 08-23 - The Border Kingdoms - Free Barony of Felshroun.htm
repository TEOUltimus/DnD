<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-23%20-%20The%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Free%20Barony%20of%20Felshroun_files/fx20060823bk_felshroun.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="227" width="325">This
 independent town stands between Shandolphyn's Reach, the Realm of the 
Smoking Star, and the Barony of Blacksaddle, where roads from all three 
places meet. An important trading market and neutral ground 
meeting-place in the Borders (much visited by outlander traders), 
Felshroun is the center of a highly-regarded horse breeding industry.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Its swiftly-expanding number of horse farms (ranches) 
rear hardy, go-anywhere mounts (such as the Feathermane and the Dusky) 
that are larger than ponies but smaller than most riding horses, yet 
have the stamina and sure-footedness to carry saddle loads over rough 
terrain like the best mountain ponies. Word of these practical, rather 
plain horses is spreading in the Vilhon and Tashalar, and every year 
more buyers come to Felshroun to procure all the horses they can.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ruled (very lightly) by an elected-for-a-decade Free 
Baron, Felshroun claims as its protectorate domain all land north of the
 Duskwood between Lammatar's Water and the West Dusking River. This 
pleasant, rolling meadowland is given over to horse farms, open pasture,
 small walled gardens, and coppices from which folk of the Free Barony 
cut their fence posts and rails. It holds few perils beyond a rare 
banshee or doppelganger.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Free Baron</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Since the founding of the barony, there have been six 
Free Barons. Although certain Felshrounans have always suspected the 
Four Mages of subtly steering this or that baron (especially Baeroph 
Heglaern, the second baron, who had decidedly dishonest tendencies) into
 acting as they saw best, or directed unwitting Foresters into 
encounters with forces advancing to attack the town stealthily on their 
own terms, such meddling has never been proven.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The current Baron -- the fat, gruff, and widely-loved 
Balaethan "the Bald" Aromm (LG male Tashalan human Ftr7 who has enormous
 hands, an even larger mustache, and twinkling green eyes) -- is two 
years into his second consecutive term. He would be honestly shocked at 
any suggestion that the Unseen Friends (as he calls the Four Mages) are 
involved in statecraft in any way.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Balaethan adjudicates crimes, trade disputes, and 
visitor and citizen complaints in the Hall of Domes at the center of 
town. He likes nothing better than playing the generous host to visiting
 merchants. His bodyguard of a dozen scarred and hard-faced women 
(heavily-armed former Inner Sea pirates) mistrust all visitors and keep 
their <i>hold person wands</i> (provided by the Four Mages) at the ready.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Hall of Domes has an armory and a dungeon, but the 
Free Baron prefers to use its meeting rooms, dining lounges, and -- only
 when he must -- its Hall of High State. Any visitor or citizen is 
entitled to bring complaints before the Baron or his three Knights of 
Justice (black-masked and robed judges appointed by the Baron, who at 
the moment all happen to be elderly matrons of the town known for their 
practical sentencing and shrewd judgements of human and demi-human 
nature). Fines, exile for a season or a decade, and "the tenday lockup" 
or "the month of rotting" (in a dungeon cell) are the usual punishments 
handed out. There's an emphasis on restitution to the victims of crimes 
and a "forgive but don't forget" attitude. Habitual criminals may find a
 watchful Forester or even one of the Baron's bodyguard at their elbows 
whenever they set foot out of their homes in Felshroun. ("There goes 
Aldhoun, with his tail wagging behind him" is a typical local comment on
 this sort of vigilant escort.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Disputes between merchants are more often settled by 
negotiations and the payment of damages than jailing. This tolerance, 
coupled with light taxation (10 gp/building owned/year, plus 1 sp/wagon 
owned/gate passage) has made Felshroun a popular "echo of Waterdeep."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Foresters of Felshroun</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Felshroun keeps order in its domain by means of the 
Foresters, highly skilled rangers who know and love the land they 
patrol. They dress informally in brown, green, and gray battle leathers 
adorned only with maroon sashes marked with their symbol -- a watchful 
falcon's head, beak to the right, atop a bear pawprint, nails downward, 
all in silver except the falcon's eyeball, which is emerald green).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Foresters do as much diligent planting, irrigation, 
and burning away of diseased plants and trees as they do drawing swords 
against miscreants. They ride the Free Barony in dozen-strong mounted 
patrols bolstered by priests of Chauntea, Mielikki, or even an 
apprentice of the Four Mages if trouble is expected. The patrol leader 
(a ranger of 8th or higher level) carries a silver hunting horn and 
wears a <i>ring of shooting stars</i> crafted so that its <i>light</i> power consists of a blinding burst of amber-hued fireworks that blossoms 200 feet into the air.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This <i>fireburst</i> or a ranger's horn call alerts 
local Watchers (usually tavernmasters or farmers) to light one of three 
beacons which are always ready to each Watcher. A lit beacon summons aid
 in the form of two dozen Foresters riding pegasi and accompanied by at 
least two battle-ready apprentice mages. This backup force is stationed 
on Highgirt Hold (a grassy hill on the edge of the Duskwood). As a 
result, brigand and monster raids in the Free Barony are few and brief.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Apprentices of the Four</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In fact, the Four Mages truly do rule Felshroun. They 
don't allow their apprentices to tutor others. Two who did take on 
pupils of their own (Elegur Dathday, LN male Chondathan human Wiz8, Str 
17, Int 18; and Jaluene Presyae, CG female half-elf Wiz7, Dex 17, Int 
17, Cha 17) found the their teachers' gates closed to them. They soon 
left Felshroun, and their current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At present, the Four can collectively muster almost 
three dozen apprentices (human and half-elven Wiz5-7). The most 
accomplished of these are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Skaera Attulbrae</b> (LG female Turami human Wiz11; Dex 17, Int 
18, Wis 17, Cha 17) is a formerly shy, studious lass of great beauty 
who's recently discovered that she likes battle. Now she 
enthusiastically charges into every fray with her ankle-length red hair 
swirling behind her. Currently Skaera is trying to perfect a spell that 
creates two <i>dancing swords</i> to fight for her at once. She can now 
manage to create and send one animated blade into battle for her while 
she works other magics or cause a dozen daggers to briefly (2 rounds) 
become flying, foe-seeking, animated perils. </li>
<li><b>Nouloxer Hethmountain</b> (NG male Mulan human Wiz10; Int 18, Wis
 18) is a quiet, rather shy man who dresses all in black or wine-dark 
purple. Nouloxer always has a backup plan, escape route, or spare spell 
or trick at the ready and is becoming a master of barrier spells -- in 
particular, spells that allow one thing but bar another. "Careful" is 
the word often used to describe him. </li>
<li><b>Anathander Berej</b> (LN male Calishite human Wiz9; Str 16, Dex 
17, Int 18, Wis 17, Cha 17) is a darkly handsome rake. He is constantly 
the subject of dark rumors involving the summoning of baatezu and links 
to the Red Wizards, the Arcane Brotherhood, or this or that other evil 
master. These rumors are untrue, though Anathander cultivates a 
mysterious air and is an accomplished escort of many handy ladies 
(frequently all at the same time). </li>
<li><b>Sortalan Baerimbar</b> (NG male Illuskan human Wiz9) has, like 
his brother Caladreth, an unshakeable calm and superior qualities of 
observation and memory. The Baerimbar brothers are the Free Barony's 
most experienced and often-encountered patrol escorts. </li>
<li><b>Caladreth Baerimbar</b> (NG male Illuskan human Wiz8) shares many
 traits with his brother Sortalan but is clean-shaven where his brother 
sports a neat, pointed black beard. </li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Four Mages</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Free Barony of Felshroun exists because of its Four 
Mages, who forged that rarest of things -- an agreement among powerful 
wizards to dwell near each other in peace, without trying to control or 
watch over each other, trusting in common cause and skill to keep their 
shared demesne safe and in good order. The Mages founded the offices of 
the Free Baron and the Foresters, then let both function unhampered by 
sorcerous meddling. They raised the wall around Felshroun and the towers
 at its four corners -- towers each still occupies today, almost a 
century later.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Four Mages keep to their towers, working on their 
magic, and are usually seen in public only at the festivals of 
Midsummer, Shieldmeet, Greengrass, and the Feast of the Founding (the 
fourth day of Ches -- it marks the day they raised the town walls around
 what was then largely farm fields and announced their pact and the 
formation of the Free Barony). They prefer seclusion and magical study 
to statecraft or adventuring and take ever-fewer apprentices -- though 
the stream of hopefuls arriving in town is increasing. Some of these 
would-be mages take apprenticeships with the only other known mage in 
Felshroun, Ladalas the Fearless (NG male Chondathan human Wiz7; Int 18, 
Wis 16), who is old, forgetful, frail, and more than a bit of a 
ditherer. Most drift on to other Border realms if the Four refuse them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Four Mages are Immirton Loaden, Selcheress Mhairtal, Durendair Hammask, and Araundra Golaunstone.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Redcloak</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Immirton "Redcloak" Loaden (NG male Tashalar human 
Wiz14/Master Transmogrifist10 [formerly a LG transmuter]; Str 17, Int 
18, Wis 17) dwells in Lakelight Tower at the northern corner of 
Felshroun's walls. The Redcloaked Mage is the eldest, most imperious, 
strict, and personally forbidding of the Four, and is sometimes called 
"the Master" or "the Foremost of the Four." His studies (which involve 
chamber-filling pools of water heated to various temperatures plus a 
room full of mud) concern the perfection of control over one's own form 
-- both<i> shape change</i> magic and immunities to <i>petrification</i>, <i>paralyzation</i>, and hostile <i>polymorph</i> magic -- and the mastery of body forms suited to life and functioning in other than dry land with breathable air.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Redcloak is thought to have largely perfected his 
personal immunity to such attack forms and to operate more or less 
constantly under a <i>shape change</i> spell that allows him to smoothly
 reshape his body as he desires (for instance, extending an impossibly 
long arm to catch something or flattening himself to pass through a 
narrow opening or hide behind something small).</p>
<p align="LEFT">He is fussy about uncluttered cleanliness in his abode 
and given to instructing apprentices to sit naked, calmly studying 
spellbooks, on the tower battlements during raging winter blizzards. 
(His intention is that they'll learn to shift their body conditions to 
match their surroundings or at least get used to the pain of failing to 
do so).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Master fears and thinks about the safety of 
Felshroun often, and always keeps a lookout for possible invading forces
 mustering nearby, infiltrators spying on the Free Barony, and possible 
alliances against his beloved town. At all times he will have spells 
prepared and magic items to hand to deal with attacks against himself or
 Felshroun.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Redcloak's studies have led him to create several 
physical duplicates of himself. These move and gesture as he does but 
cannot speak. He uses these as decoys to make observers believe he's 
departing or at a certain place when he's in truth elsewhere, and he has
 devised a means of casting spells so that they emerge (are launched, or
 appear to be cast) from one or more of his decoys rather than himself. 
Both the duplicates and this spell-effect-transference are experimental 
and often misfire -- even the slightest damage to one of his duplicates 
often causes it to slump down into the mud it was fashioned from.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Manyfaced Lady</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Sentinel, the eastern wall-tower of Felshroun, is 
home to Selcheress Mhairtal (CG female half-elf Wiz17/Horizon Walker2; 
Dex 18, Int 18, Wis 16, Cha 17), who hides her features behind a 
collection of colorfully-decorated masks. This serene, peace-loving 
beauty is (falsely) rumored in town to choose her apprentices -- human 
males only (another false belief) -- on the basis of their rugged good 
looks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Selcheress is often called the "Manyfaced Lady" or the 
"Masked, Manyfaced One." She's intensely interested in Realmspace and 
the other crystal spheres of the multiverse and what lies between them. 
Scrying spells of truly awesome range and magics that can pierce 
phlogiston and crystal spheres alike are her chief work. She also 
maintains an ever-growing collection of maps of, and items from, other 
crystal spheres. In the same vein, she keeps track of major events, both
 recent and from the distant past, seeking to learn which races went 
where and did what in the vast spaces around Toril. Though she rarely 
travels out of her tower, her more capable apprentices are often loaded 
down with magical gear (much of this gear is laden with spells that 
allow Selcheress to trace her apprentices and/or spy upon their 
surroundings). These apprentices are sent forth to explore the spheres 
aboard the Manyfaced Lady's skyship [<i>Unearthed Arcana</i>], which is 
grounded in Highgirt Hold -- the unused White Tower at the south end of 
Highgirt Hill -- plus several more of various types and sizes kept 
concealed in a ravine in the Duskwood.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though she dislikes violence, the Lady is prepared to defend herself with various wands, a ring that allows her to <i>fly</i> and cast <i>reverse gravity</i> at others, and with a spell of her own crafting that duplicates the effect of <i>beads of force</i>. Her hobbies are said to include sad elven minstrelry and <i>flying</i>
 in the moonlight. Sometimes she combines the two, swooping over Faerûn 
in search of firesides, taverns, faraway elven musicians, or moonlit 
glades where the sorrowful music she loves is rising up.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Selcheress is widely rumored to be hopelessly, unhappily
 in love with someone, but there is fierce disagreement among local 
gossips who that is. Candidates include one of her fellow Four, a proud 
elf prince half the world away (that would explain the music), a 
respected, powerful mage already married to another -- perhaps even 
Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun of Waterdeep! No one knows for sure, and 
the Manyfaced Lady says nothing about such matters.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greenshadow</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Durendair "Greenshadow" Hammask (NG male Illuskan human 
Wiz14/Horizon Walker4/MysticTheurge2; Str 17, Dex 16, Int 18, Wis 18) is
 a gentle, nondescript man whose attention is bent on the forest and all
 growing things. He specializes in spells that rejuvenate and reshape 
them. He dwells in Watchwood Tower, Felshroun's southern wall-tower, 
which he's fashioned into a shaft open to the sky wherein trees, shrubs,
 and mosses grow and a waterfall cascades endlessly into a pool only to 
magically flow up the wall and plunge down again. Durendair's magic 
keeps the water flowing, the temperature moderate even when the sky 
above is howling with the worst winter storms, and new plants appearing,
 transported from the Deep Duskwood. A balcony-like ramp with a parapet 
spirals up the inside wall of the tower, around and around the small 
enclosed woodland bower. It leads to the chambers of various apprentices
 (set into the thickness where the town walls meet the turret) and a 
lofty room open to the stars but roofed with an invisible barrier by 
means of Durendair's magic. A round bed of lush mosses floats in the 
room.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When arising, Durendair likes to leap from his bed in a 
spectacular dive down into the pool, to frolic or bathe or simply float 
and think. A <i>feather fall</i> governing the entire central 
shaft-chamber can be activated by anyone uttering the word "softly" if 
they misjudge their plunge into the waters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Durendair has unruly brown hair and a tired face, and he
 wears either torn forester's leathers or nothing. Quiet and unassuming,
 he avoids the company of anyone talkative in favor of silent 
contemplation among the sounds of nature. His habit of walking or 
drifting (feet just clear of tangled shrubbery) silently through forests
 earned him his nickname of Greenshadow, but his few apprentices prefer 
to refer to him as "Silent Thought."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Durendari urges his apprentices to go naked, drink 
spring water, eat berries, and take beast-shape often to learn the 
balances and hidden ways of living things. The folk of the Free Barony 
have learned not to hunt or molest beasts that fly, trot, or prowl to or
 from the Watchwood Tower. Wherever the apprentices roam, they know that
 if they call on their master by name, he will hear, and can reply with a
 voice in their minds, even linking them all mentally if he desires. 
Greenshadow often challenges would-be apprentices, male and female, to 
mud-wrestling matches and gauges their suitability by the enthusiasm of 
their response.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Durendair's magic can pluck fearsome monsters from 
remote corners of the Realms and unleash them in the heart of an 
encamped enemy. He did this famously in the Year of the Saddle (1345 DR)
 when greedy mercenaries settling in Shandolphyn's Reach foolishly 
decided that, with winter coming down upon them, making a short ride 
east to seize a likely-looking town would be easier than building 
shelter of their own before the snows came.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Greenshadow is also said to be able to animate trees as a treant does and use an arcane version of <i>transport via plants</i> at will.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Durendair often runs with wolves and wrestles bears for 
sport. A man of lusty tastes, he occasionally appears at feasts put on 
by the Baron, where he devours prodigious amounts of food -- roasts by 
the score, wine by a hand-count of casks, and whole tables of prepared 
sweets and vegetables. None of this seems to have any ill or 
intoxicating effect on him. By the same token, he can go for a month or 
more without appearing to eat anything. Durendair's also been known to 
sleep for days on end, muttering and growling softly as if he was a bear
 or wolf, and to walk about unaffected by extreme cold, wetness, forest 
fires, or beating sunlight, even when he's naked.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some of his apprentices believe he has found, or is on 
the verge of finding, a new path to near-immortality. This method is 
believed to embrace life rather than the undeath of lichdom. The quiet, 
unassuming Silent Thought is unlikely, however, to tell anyone his true 
goals and achievements.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Black Flame</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Araundra Golaunstone is better known as "Black Flame" because of her magical style. At will she can hurl magical <i>black flame</i>
 from her palms. These black, crawling bolts of force are said to sear 
flesh and life energy alike, leaving only bones behind. They are in 
truth equal to <i>darkfire</i> (<i>Magic of Faerun</i>, <i>Spell Compendium</i>)
 except that they deal damage equal to 1d4 plus 1 point for each of her 
character levels -- currently 1d4+18. She's also sometimes called "the 
Lady of Folly Tower" because she lives in Felshroun's Folly, the western
 corner tower of the town.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Black Flame (CG female Rashemi human Wiz16/Arch2; Dex 
18, Int 18, Cha 18) is icily beautiful. Her wild fury fascinates and 
awes most citizens of the Free Barony, who see not only her stunning 
good looks but something wild and driven in her eyes on the rare 
occasions when she walks among them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Black-haired and black-gowned, Araundra loves to dance 
with wild abandon, becoming a wild, fluid thing that draws mens' eyes as
 she loses herself in sweating acrobatics, bounding and twirling in 
abandon. Sometimes she sobs as she dances. To those who watch, it always
 seems as if something frightening is lurking on the verge of being 
released.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Golaunstone never talks about how she gained her black 
flame, but she's known to fly into shrieking hatred at the sight of 
neogi, chasme, and yochlol, often screaming "Juiblex!" repeatedly even 
after her foes are destroyed or routed. Madness and deadly loss of 
control never seem far beneath her arrestingly-beautiful surface. 
Araundra takes very few apprentices, and the occasional flashes, 
rumbles, and shrieks from the high windows of Folly Tower hint at why.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She loves battle. Some Borderers swear they've seen 
Black Flame fly out of nowhere to join battles between forces that must 
be strangers to her just to have something to lash out against. At 
heights of battle-stress, she shifts shape into something large, scaled,
 and ugly -- a pyrohydra that spits the same black flame she hurls in 
human form.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Hers was the fury that routed the attacks on Felshroun 
that the Four repulsed. Hers is the seemingly unsleeping vigilance that 
most diligently scours the Border Kingdoms for frays to burst into the 
midst of (adventurers, be warned!) and scrutinizes the Free Barony and 
the lands around it for approaching trouble. Guards who've done duty on 
the town battlements say the uppermost chamber in Folly Tower holds a 
gigantic, black crystal ball. It rises up, wreathed in sparkling, starry
 radiance, to float in midair whenever Black Flame enters the chamber --
 and she sometimes flies slowly around it, black gown flapping, as she 
watches something in its heart.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Elminster of Shadowdale has said that he knows Black 
Flame's story (her precise powers and how she acquired them) but that 
any adventurer who wants to know the truth had best have the backbone to
 go to the Dancing Sorceress and ask her -- and the agility to flee like
 the very wind if he wants to survive having asked the question.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Luckily for citizens of the Free Barony, Black Flame 
seems to love Felshroun and to cherish her friendship with her fellow 
founding mages. She rarely shows more than sad cynicism when displeased 
by a citizen's deeds and prefers to avoid evenly-matched brawls and 
confrontations within the town. Sorcerers, brigands, and drunken 
merchants foolish enough to attack or threaten the raven-haired Lady of 
Folly Tower, however, and anyone who marauds in the countryside of the 
Barony, had best beware a black-gowned woman who flies like an arrow and
 hurls black, slaying flame. To ignore that advice generally means 
death. It's a choice Araundra Golaunstone seems to take a grim delight 
in giving many folk who do violence. Some of them even make the right 
choice.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What Meets The Eye In Felshroun</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Felshroun is a town of walled gardens, tall houses, and narrow, winding, crowded streets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It stands in the shape of a large diamond with towers at
 each compass-point corner and gates in the center of each wall between.
 Each tower can be entered (by those on foot, in the conventional 
manner) only through a huge double door on the inside of the town walls,
 in the angle where two walls meet. Each swinging door of these entries 
is actually a stone golem, and the two golems grind open to reveal an 
iron inner door that is an iron golem. Beyond it is a gauntlet of traps 
and holding areas that vary from mage to mage but are known to include 
trained mimics, portcullises that fall in closely spaced grids to create
 pillar-like trap areas just large enough to encase an immobile standing
 man, and so on. Defenses are typically activated by any use of hostile 
or destructive magic, any attempt to dig, pry open, or shatter any part 
of the walls, floor, or ceiling near the doors, or whenever a scrying 
apprentice believes that visitors mean ill to those in the tower.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The northern turret is Lakelight Tower, and the gate on 
the northeastern wall is the Dusking Gate. The road out of it to the 
Duskfords is called Ralavar's Way.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The eastern tower is called The Sentinel. It commands an easterly view clear across the Waevendusk to the far banks. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The southeastern gate is Lambsgate, so called because it
 opens onto a meadow divided into paddocks where sheep are marshaled for
 market rather than emitting a road that goes anywhere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The southern turret is named Watchwood Tower because it 
overlooks the Duskwood, and the southwestern gate is Burning Banner Gate
 thanks to a long-ago battle between competing mercenary bands which 
hoped to rule Felshroun (both came to bad ends, one at the hands of the 
other and the survivor at the hands of the Four Mages). The road out of 
it is Westwater Way, named for the ford over Lammatar's Water, where the
 road winds on its way southwest to Luthbaern and the Barony of 
Blacksaddle.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The town's western tower is Felshroun's Folly (or more 
often simply "the Folly"). The name comes from the grizzled old farmer 
whose lands these once were. He built a ramshackle wooden lookout tower 
on this spot just because he wanted to, only to see it fall down in high
 winds, several times, though he kept calmly rebuilding it. The gate in 
the northwestern wall is Reach Gate (so named because the Shore Road, 
which runs out of it, shortly enters the realm of Shandolphyn's Reach).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Inside the town walls is a cramped labyrinth of four- 
and five-floor houses, winding flagstone streets, little walled gardens 
with pump-wells and public benches, many cats wandering as public pets, 
and two focal areas -- the central Hall of Domes (seat of the Free 
Baron) and Sevenways, where seven streets meet in a crazy conjunction of
 angled alleys.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The best tavern in Felshroun is the Moldy Cheese And 
Laughing Spoon (Good/Moderate), with The Rum Boot (Fair/Cheap) and 
Pinchbeck's<i></i>Tankard (Poor/Cheap) as competition. The best inn is 
The Sunset Swan (Excellent/Expensive), but folk who feel uneasy in 
haughty luxury prefer the less formal The Gone Gallant<i></i>(Good/Moderate), the more spartan Black<i></i>Boar's Eye (Fair/Cheap), or Dunselbow's House (Poor/Cheap).</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are also rooming houses (Mother Fustin's is 
generally considered the best, thanks to her meat pie with sharp cheese)
 and The Beardhouse, a warriors' hostel (bare bunk and outhouse for 1 
cp/night), where six gruff dwarves keep order and make sure there's no 
thievery from sleeping men.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In such a bustling town, shops and deals change with 
bewildering rapidity, but one superb establishment deserves lasting 
mention -- the Rolling Gnome music shop, where instruments, sheet music,
 and touchstones (small, smooth, hand-sized rocks enchanted so as to 
replay the same short tune whenever touched by a bare finger) are sold. 
The five proprietors are a human couple, a male elf, and two half-elven 
females who live in the shop attic and make weird harp and flute music 
at night (it's rumored that they play for the benefit of dancing sprites
 and other fey). All are retired minstrels rumored to be Harpers. (In 
truth, they are all Harper 'friends', acting as observers and providing 
safe house accommodations to visiting Harpers. None are adventurers but 
all are expert musicians and instrument makers. The humans are Paerlin 
and Andustra Taunbellow, the moon elf is Dalyeon Darmintshadow, and the 
half-elves are Daundra Crownlock and Yaryespra Huntingwood.) 'The Gnome'
 stands on Baraedur Lane.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fendle Street is the busiest street for small shops. 
Used goods and sundries are sold, and the aforementioned Moldy Cheese 
can be found, as well as several cheap 'soup and frybun' eateries.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lorndragon Lane is the haughtiest Felshrounan address, 
lined with gem shops with glittering windows, dealers of fine 
furnishings, high-coin scent shops, and brightcloak establishments (high
 fashion clothiers) stand amid the many-balconied, arch-gated, 
high-walled mansions of the very wealthy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Storrockh Street is where mounts can be stabled, coaches
 and horse-carts (suitably narrow for navigating the cramped town 
streets) rented or bought, and strongshoulders (loaders and moving men) 
hired by the day (typically 2 sp/head) or half-day (1 sp/head).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Houndworm Street is the seediest part of town. Brawls 
and muggings befall wanderers on dark nights, bodyguards and fast-dagger
 toughs can be hired, and the cheapest 'alley-comfort' lasses offer 
their wares. Those contemplating mayhem are warned that maskfaced 
Foresters visit the Houndworm often, keeping watch for troublemakers. 
("Maskfaced" refers to the Foresters using disguises or otherwise 
operating undercover, not to the wearing of actual masks.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Future of the Barony</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Thanks to its trade-friendliness and its horseflesh, the
 Free Barony of Felshroun is one of the best-known Border locales among 
folk outside the Border Kingdoms. Minstrels sing of it often when 
performing the ballads "The Rider O'er The Moon" and "The Dryad and the 
Gargoyle."</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Free Barony is an attractive place. The Zhentarim, 
the Red Wizards, the Arcane Brotherhood, and half a dozen smaller 
mage-cabals (particularly Calishite who are shut out of the paths to 
power in their own country) all watch Felshroun with an eye to seizing 
control. That won't happen untiul (and if) someone catches the Four 
Mages napping.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Several of these groups believe they may be ready to 
conquer Felshroun through spell-battle, but to win the Barony that way 
would smash it. Its value depends on residents and visitors trading 
enthusiastically, but that relies on the current security and fair rule.
 Whoever seizes Felshroun must do it covertly or the prize will be 
shattered in the taking. If open battle broke out in the streets, 
merchants and their money would flee in all directions, leaving behind 
little more than a horse market. The anticipated difficulty of a 
behind-the-scenes takeover has kept the gathering wolves at bay for two 
decades, but sometime soon, someone will grow too impatient to hold off 
any longer.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Llll In the meantime, crowding within the town walls is 
becoming a real problem, and there's ever-increasing pressure on the 
Free Baron to allow building around the town--and to hire mages to blast
 a way down through the lofty cliffs at the shore of the Lake of Steam, 
to create a port similarly friendly to merchants. So far, the Baron has 
done nothing to further such plans, though it's widely believed in town 
that he's asked the Four Mages for their advice, and is awaiting a 
reply.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For their part, the Four Mages diligently defend the 
town they founded. During the Night of Fire (Tarsakh 17 in the Year of 
the Bow, 1354 DR) when they fought off a direct attack by the Red 
Wizards. The great battle took place high in the sky with wizards 
standing on empty air and hurling spectacular, sky-spanning lightning 
and other spells. Two years later, the Four Mages are thought to have 
headed off a destructive wyrm during the Flight of Dragons, though no 
one actually saw them take to the air above Felshroun on that occasion.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Far more recently (Mirtul 6 in the Year of Wild Magic, 
1372 DR), they caused the blaze that slew Ibryn Shelarnshoa of Calimshan
 and destroyed the top of his tower on Shuttle Street. The Four let 
their involvement be publicly known by a series of <i>magic mouth</i> 
spells that appeared on the bar that same night in the most popular 
tavern in town, the Moldy Cheese And Laughing Spoon on Fendle Street. 
Their message informed all that they would not tolerate evil sorcerers 
dwelling in Felshroun or the "unwise summoning of things from beyond" to
 do ill to other citizens.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All of this is why some folk think Felshroun is the best
 place to dwell they've yet found in Faerûn -- and others think it is 
doomed.</p>
