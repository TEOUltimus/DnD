<p align="LEFT"><b>Bowshot</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2006-14%20-%20The%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Bowshot_files/fx0614_borderkingdoms_bowshot.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="131" width="250">A
 winding wagon road through the heart of the land of Owlhold, the 
Bowshot has a well-deserved "fell and dangerous" reputation, thanks to 
brigands, monsters, and breakneck ravines and bogs that claim a toll of 
travelers every season. Far more travelers survive but lose their way, 
wandering for days on the various backland trails of Owlhold before 
either finding a way out or succumbing to bogs or the repeated harryings
 of brigands.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For all its windings, the Bowshot can be said to run 
north-south, linking The Four Stags inn at the midpoint of the Green 
Road (a larger, better-traveled trade road between Oeble and Bloutar 
that largely skirts the land of Owlhold) with The Griffon Aflame inn on 
Longcrag Ride (a newly-rebuilt road that runs between Talduth Vale and 
Beldargan), in Owlhold's interior.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Traversing the road from south to north, the traveler will find the following features.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Griffon Aflame</b> (Good/Moderate) is a rustic, 
timber-built inn standing in a wooded hollow. Always damp and dimly-lit 
(like the misty dell around it), it has a certain gloomy charm. 
Mushrooms sprout unbidden in the wet, rotting wood of this cozy house 
that throws rambling wings out into the forest in all directions. It's 
home to many permanent residents (some of them interesting folk indeed, 
with surprising skills and secrets) as well as way-guests. The Griffon 
boasts comfortable beds (many slung from the rafters on thick ropes), 
formidable beer and wine cellars, and generous, tasty stews. It's named 
for a long-ago aerial battle wherein a dragon rider downed a flight of 
griffon-back foes. A good way to start an argument at the Griffon is to 
ask the identities of those warring parties or why they clashed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fallenfalcon:</b> Traveling the Bowshot north from 
the Griffon, the wayfarer will first find Fallenfalcon, a camping 
pavilion beside a drinkable stream and pool faced by four cottages 
inhabited by half-elven families. The two closest to the road house 
Nressa the Weaver and the family of Jlonkin the Bowyer, who both serve 
hot or cold bread and soups to travelers on short notice and can manage 
substantial meals by prearrangement. Plentiful herbs and edible berries 
grow wild for the picking along the trailside north of Fallenfalcon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trollhead Bridge:</b> The next site moving north 
along the road is Trollhead Bridge, a wide, rail-less span across a bog.
 A message-stone at its south end is carved in the likeness of a 
long-nosed troll head as tall as a large warrior. (A message stone is 
rock in whose crevices written missives are left by prearrangement. 
Anyone who removes or alters a message not meant for them receives an 
arrow through one hand if any Owlen sees or hears of the deed.) At the 
Bridge is a sleeping pavilion with firepit and a pump. Travelers are 
warned that dry firewood is rare in the vicinity, but stinging swamp 
insects are not.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hathlock House:</b> The farer north from the Bridge 
will traverse the road up out of bogs to arrive at Hathlock's Rest, a 
former foresters' settlement now abandoned except for Hathlock House 
(Fair/Moderate), a rustic way-inn that offers uninspired food and clean 
but spartan sleeping and stabling. Luxuries and amenities can't be had 
no matter how many coins a traveler offers. The House is primarily the 
common residence of seven hunters and fur-trappers, not a well-supplied 
inn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Wolf Belt:</b> Two days of hard travel through 
deep, wolf-roamed woods north of the Rest stands the Wolf Belt 
(Fair/Expensive), a tavern of sorts. It's a large, open campground with 
privies at one end and a serving-shack at the other. The serving shack 
is no more than a rough, wooden shed built over a keg cellar, wherein 
staff serve drinks across a counter to patrons standing on a covered 
porch. The drink is strong and rough rather than refined, famous, or 
imported from afar, but the supply is seemingly endless, and in winter 
the fare is usually supplemented by a hot mushroom-and-herb rabbit 
broth. The Belt is open at all hours. At night or in severe weather, the
 porch shutters are fastened down to leave only a single 
serving-opening.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Apt to host more than its share of drunken brawls and 
contests, the Belt is policed by the brawniest of its servers, two 
man-mountain brothers known as Ueval and Ivver Ringam (both LN male 
Chondathan humans; Ueval is a Ftr4/Rgr2, Str 18, Con 19, and Ivver is a 
Ftr5/Rgr2, Str 17, Con 18). They are bolstered by bottles thrown hard 
and accurately by their spiderlike, long-limbed, and lanky female fellow
 server, Shassra 'Darkeyes' Rurth (whom few know is the owner of the 
place). Shassra is a CN female Shaaran human Rog9, who never forgets a 
face or name.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The twenty-odd staff of the Belt dwell under the 
serving-shack in cellars arranged in a series of defensible points, with
 the keg-cellars outermost, a firewood cellar next, then living quarters
 (with beast-screened airshafts that come to the surface halfway down 
the side of a wooded hill behind the Belt, under the concealing greenery
 of many broadleaf shrubs), and a pantry innermost.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Much of the drink sold at the Belt is brewed or 
distilled in the woods behind the serving-shack. There are rumors that 
an altar to a dark god (tales vary as to just which one) stands back 
there, too, and that the staff of the Belt worships this dark power. 
Such tales, it should be noted, do little to discourage clientele or 
consumption. The truth is that two local trappers worship Shar at an old
 altar, and the staff of the Belt (who dwell together in one large, 
multispouse family) avoid it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sabroar's Hold:</b> Sabroar was a locally famous 
priest of Silvanus who consecrated many groves to the Green Father but 
here established herb gardens for the use of his followers. They 
continued to tend them after his death. So many buyers came here, 
needing a place to stay overnight, that the two-story inn of Sabroar's 
Hold (Excellent/Moderate) was built. In turn, its presence spurred 
artisans (weavers, glassblowers, and sellers-of-seeds) to take rooms 
here from time to time to sell their wares and then melt back into the 
forest until next they have enough to sell to make the trip. Priests of 
Silvanus police the inn against thefts, swindlers, and to settle trade 
disputes, acting as moneychangers and bankers (keeping the funds of the 
nervous hidden safe in exchange for trade-tokens).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Chief among them are Erendin Speaker-for-Sabroar (LN 
male Calishite human Cleric 10 [Silvanus]) and his assistants Snaruldar 
(N male Shaaran human Cleric 5 [Silvanus]) and Jessilleia (CG female 
Calishite human Cleric 4 [Silvanus]), who use no surnames since taking 
service with the Oak Father. They heal only in emergencies, directing 
most ill and injured on to Jester's Hollow, and have nothing to do with 
running the inn.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The master of the Hold is the jovial, slender, agile 
prankster (and avid dancer) Imryn Roaringhorn (CG male Tethyrian human 
Rog7/Shadowdancer2), a distant relation to that noble Waterdhavian 
family. He directs a staff of almost twenty (notably a dozen stout, 
matronly women who know far more of the world than they let on -- both 
are good cooks and skilled street fighters who once wore armor for 
Tethyr). Roaringhorn tries to be a friend to all. He's sensitive and 
thoughtful enough to be regarded as such by most in the Hold.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The inn kitchens turn out wonderful breads, cakes, and 
pastries. In addition, there are satisfying stews and roasts garnished 
only with forest fowl, which owe most of their hearty taste to forest 
vegetables and sauces seasoned by fare found in the woods around the 
Hold (mushrooms, mosses, roots, and berries). This would come as a 
surprise to many of the travelers who delight in the hearty "boar" and 
"stag" roasts that seldom have anything to do with either beast.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jester's Hollow:</b> This broad, wooded stream valley
 is hung with lanterns and is often adrift with pleasing cooking-smokes.
 It holds the inn that bears its name and a dozen charming cottages. Six
 are the clearly-signed homes of folk who welcome customers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A rock-studded brook meanders through the hollow. 
Laughing Lady Stream is named for a long-dead sorceress who once dwelt 
in the hollow (the inn stands on the foundations of her tiny tower) and 
whose proper name, Jestra, became corrupted into "Jester" to give the 
hollow its present name.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Jestra Illowhand liked to preserve music to hear over 
and over in the privacy of her tower without musicians. She devised a 
spell that captured short snatches of sound in rock crystals and 
gemstones. Any human touch on a stone caused it to 'play' the captured 
sounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Somewhere in the woods near the hollow is the buried 
entrance to the cavern where Jestra stored the gems she'd thus treated, 
now a priceless collection of not just music but of long-dead kings, 
wizards, bards, and sages speaking on everything from the whereabouts of
 buried treasure to philosophical musings on the purposes of life and 
ruling and wars. Its finder can literally name his price for most of the
 gems.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Descending into the hollow from the south, the traveler 
comes first to the home and shop of "Belomeier Tathchant, Dealer in 
Locks, Keys, Chains, Hinges, Coffers, and Lanterns." Belomeier is a fat 
and affable man of pleasant ugliness and deft skill (NG male Calishite 
human Exp6) who makes and repairs small and dainty specimens of all the 
items his sign proclaims. He also sells tiny, razor-sharp daggers with 
sheaths for strapping onto forearms, into boots, and onto belts. His 
prices are just slightly above average, but his wares are of the best 
quality.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Next to Belomeier stands the abode of "Jarvathra 
Ploorst, Talismans and Fortunes." In her spicy-scented, cluttered home, 
Jarvathra -- a dreamy-eyed, gushing woman who never seems to sleep or 
close her business -- dispenses all manner of talismans which may or may
 not have any real power to ward anything. Some of them are unique 
mixtures of feathers, carved glass, stones, and smoked leather bindings.
 She tells fortunes, specializing in the reading of candles lit by a 
client and in the interpretation of card games played between her and 
the client.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Jarvathra (CG female Shaaran human Exp1) has many male 
patrons who delight in her affectionate, comforting ways, but her 
oft-used bed is not for sale, and she'd be furious to be considered an 
escort-for-hire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Her neighbors to the north, on the other hand, are happy
 to be sought out as just that. "Dalethra and Tasheera: Twice The 
Pleasure," declares their signboard, though in truth they usually work 
in shifts rather than together.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Their stone house is decorated like a vampire-haunted 
castle --all guttering braziers and manacles (purely for show). It has 
chambers furnished in great variety, one resembling a dungeon cell, two 
others princesses' bedchambers, another a shoproom, and so on.</p>
<p align="LEFT">These two tall, raven-haired, and strikingly beautiful 
sisters were once palace poisoners to a Calishite pasha. They now 
restrict their mixings to the making, use, and selling of 'love 
philtres' that could more accurately be described as ardor-inducing 
drinks. Dalethra and Tasheera Olombrys (both CG female Tashalan human 
Exp2s) do what has politely been described as "a roaring trade," making 
necessary the hiring of a dwarf doorguard and appointment secretary by 
the name of Grint Galathammer. This gruff, efficient dwarf dispenses 
free beer to those kept waiting. He is as wide as he is tall and as 
strong as a warhorse (LN male dwarf Ftr8, Str 18, Con 16). He reports 
that his employers need more sleep, and he may soon connive with one of 
the healers in the hollow to give them enforced vacations by putting 
them to sleep for a tenday here and there.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One of those healers, "Nalbeth Thortir/Salves and Gentle
 Healings," is located next door. Nalbeth is a kindly, gaunt young man 
(NG male Tethyrian human Exp8) who has little skill at internal 
illnesses. He freely admits this, directing folk with such complaints to
 Aratha, across the hollow. Nalbeth is very capable in matters of 
staunching bleeding, cleaning and closing open wounds, banishing 
infections, and dealing with sprains, torn muscles, broken bones, and 
eye injuries.</p>
<p align="LEFT">He also sells a few powerful pain-banishing drinks for 
those who must continue to travel or work despite pain or nausea, but 
recommends these not be used in place of proper care. Nalbeth's prices 
are high, but his work is worth it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Entirely unembarrassed by nudity and seemingly 
uninterested in sex, Nalbeth does become alarmed when asked to deal with
 problems of pregnancy. He'll hastily declare that he knows nothing 
about such things and direct those who request aid to Erendin of 
Silvanus.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Next to Nalbeth's little stone cottage is the inn itself. The handsome, fieldstone <i>Jester's Hollow</i> (Excellent/Moderate) stands on a little knoll at the bottom of the hollow where a simple bridge crosses Laughing Lady Stream.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This wayhouse makes its coins as a resting-place for 
those who come to trade with the artisans of the hollow. Apt to be damp 
(and clammy in winter), it's breezy year round, bright and welcoming 
within (all rooms having pleasant window views and solid, comfortable 
furnishings). It features a common, heated herbal bathing tub just off 
the taproom, where tired travelers can relax and banish the aches of 
weary feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The mint wine is excellent and clears the palate for 
buttery biscuits, served to all guests. Warm robes are also provided for
 all, and the staff wear them to encourage such casual dress everywhere 
indoors. The dining room has a wall of windows that opens onto a little 
dancing green where harpists, singers, and horn players often entertain.
 Guests are encouraged to dance for fun, not worrying about skill. Those
 who like the <i>Jester</i> tend to <i>really</i> like it and return to 
stay year after year, whenever they can, lingering as long as possible. 
It's said that a disguised Azoun IV of Cormyr was among their ranks more
 than once, accompanied by a certain grumbling Royal Magician of Cormyr.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Climbing away from the stream going north, the traveler 
will next come to the home of "Aratha of the Mysteries/Healing Potions 
For Sale." Aratha (CG female Illuskan human Com3) is a young, plump 
woman of intense and fiery character, flowing flame-orange hair that 
brushes the floor behind her as she rushes about, and endless curiosity 
about her clients and all they've seen or heard recently.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She'll chat in an endless gush of enthusiastic questions
 and observations as she doles out whatever seems necessary from among 
her surprisingly effective array of drinkables. These "potions" are sold
 in a mismatched glass forest of reused and often incongrous bottles 
(from fanciful perfume containers to former large-guzzle wine bottles 
from distant royal or noble cellars). Certain clients swear they've 
imbibed <i>potions of healing</i> from among her wares, though Aratha professes (honestly) to know nothing of magic.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She is quite good at scolding the careless, at 
diagnosing internal pains and upsets (including poisonings), and at 
doing what she can to treat them. Aratha knows the basics of birthing 
and the complaints of mothers-to-be. She's no midwife, but she will 
summon druidesses (by ringing a special bell) from the nearest grove to 
set a patient at ease or to assist at an imminent birth.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Aratha's cottage is overrun by many freely-wandering 
hens, whose eggs she enjoys. She feeds these fowl all manner of special 
seeds, and some grow to be twice average size.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The lane north of Aratha's leads to a large cottage set 
among trees. Its signboard proclaims it to be the home of the "Wizard's 
Choice Companions/All Travelers Welcome." A small army of lady and 
gentleman escorts retired from city trade shares this house of growing 
repute, where the style is "relaxed and tender comfort for the weary."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most patrons think the word "wizard" in the name is mere
 whimsy, but in truth it refers to the great secret of Jester's Hollow 
-- all of its businesses have been bankrolled by, and are under the 
protection of, a reclusive wizard who wears a jester's costume whenever 
he appears openly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This archmage slips <i>potions of healing</i> into 
Aratha's stock, makes some of Jarvatha's talismans work -- and watches 
patrons come and go, waiting for someone. He's never told anyone who 
he's seeking, why, or the reason he came to this remote woodland spot to
 hide. He goes by the obviously-false name of "Tomkins" (a name given to
 old buffoons in minstrels' plays). Yet he doesn't hesitate to drop his 
disguise and hurl spells when brigands or adventurers misbehave in 'his'
 hollow, so he can't be hiding out of fear.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Several of the Companions think he's mad. That may be 
true, but when one is dealing with wizards, any assumption is dangerous,
 and one of madness doubly so. It's such a glib reason, so easily 
misapplied to the mysterious. Jester's Hollow may yet erupt with the 
truth.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Four Stags</b> (Good/Expensive) is a large, 
handsome, cedar-shingled log building with flagstone floors. It sits on a
 hillock surrounded by a circular earthen wall thickly planted with tall
 pines. It's a bustling place that has three wings of sleeping-chambers 
opening off a long, lofty, crosswise common hall dominated by two 
spit-sizzling cooking hearths at either end (each having an adjacent 
kitchen). "Below" the inn, on the slopes of the knoll, are sheds where 
one can rent a secure "long stall" for one's intact team and wagon to be
 driven into, settled (and locked in) for the night, and then driven out
 the other end come morning.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"The Stags" is where many Owlen come to trade goods with
 passing merchants, hire companionship, and see all they desire of the 
wider world. Fresh news from afar is eagerly devoured while maps and 
curios from 'the outlands' fascinate the visiting Owlen. The master of 
the place, Aumrudan Rulhorn (a stern-looking, gray-haired LN male 
Tethyrian human Ftr16) is regarded by Owlen as a judge, wise sage, 
rightful ruler, and banker combined. To his credit, he gravely and 
diligently performs all of those roles without a trace of arrogance or 
overbearing authority. His quiet, firm word is law up and down the 
Bowshot. If he's ever attacked or even defied in the Stags, a dozen or 
more Owlen adventurers (visiting for a night or just for the next meal) 
will leap to his aid, unbidden.</p>
