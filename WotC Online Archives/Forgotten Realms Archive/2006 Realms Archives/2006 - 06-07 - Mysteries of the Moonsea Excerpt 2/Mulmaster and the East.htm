<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Mulmaster and the East</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>There is a new order in Mulmaster -- my order. For 
too long, we have allowed ourselves to be second to powers like Zhentil 
Keep and Hillsfar. Under my guidance, Mulmaster will soon rise to become
 the dominant force in the Moonsea!"</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">-- High Blade Rassendyll "Selfaril" Uoumdolphin</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Geographical Overview</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">From the sea, Mulmaster looks captivating enough. A 
pirate once likened it to a gleaming pearl washed up on shore. Gabled 
rooftops, slender alabaster towers, and a thicket of wooden masts rise 
up behind the pale gray walls that neatly enclose the harbor and 
shoreline districts. The city crawls up the slopes of mountains that 
peak to its south, and set upon these peaks are some of the most 
majestic spires overlooking the entire Moonsea.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Mulmaster's charm fades quickly as one navigates the 
overcrowded harbor or passes through the city's fortified gates. Never 
mind the occasional body floating in the harbor, the dour guards at the 
gates, or the rotten stench! The buildings nearest the docks are 
dilapidated and weatherworn, the people here live in squalor, and 
criminals strike with impunity. Farther up the mountainside, where the 
air is fresher, hateful fences and intimidating walls separate the homes
 of the wealthy elite from the ghettos, and desperate beggars are openly
 berated and beaten in the streets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The highest spur of land in mountainous Mulmaster is the
 site of the Towers of the Blade, a sprawling cluster of residential 
spires where the ruling families of the city abide in luxury. Here the 
guards are well paid and jovial, the cries of the poor are stifled by 
the chill north wind, and local law is written with bribes. Cloaked 
figures skulk about, but their business remains their own. One can 
easily fall in love with the world from up here, where the air is 
thinner and the people are fatter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Mulmaster sits on the edge of a cruel, cold, rugged 
tract of land dominated by the western Earthspur and Galena Mountains. 
Although the mountains offer some protection against bitter winds and 
heavy snow from the north and east, they are treacherous to cross and 
don't grant Mulmasterites safe and easy passage to the Unapproachable 
East. Most land traffic from Mulmaster heads south, along a 
well-traveled trade road that skirts the eastern edge of Cormanthor and 
plunges headlong into The Vast, east of the Dragon Reach.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Scores of despondent refugees from Zhentil Keep camp in 
shacks and shanties outside the city walls, relying on the 
uncharacteristic charity of the city's corrupt nobility. Mulmasterites 
generally resent and distrust the newcomers, who take food from the 
mouths of poor city folk and offer precious little in return. Beyond 
Mulmaster, the eastern Moonsea region boasts little else in the way of 
settlements apart from a smattering of fishing villages, monasteries, 
and citadels.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The White River slips between the jagged Galena and 
Earthspur Mountains, heading east toward Narfell, Damara, and Impiltur. 
The black basalt fortress known as Ironfang Keep looms over the river's 
mouth and remains a constant source of worry and consternation among 
Mulmaster's nobility, although the dark wizards who dwell there have yet
 to raise a finger toward their corrupt neighbor to the west.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Campaign in Mulmaster</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The quests in this chapter are intended for characters 
of 9th-15th level. Presumably the PCs will wander into Mulmaster after 
having spent some time exploring the northern and southern Moonsea 
regions around Melvaunt and Hillsfar. In all likelihood, they have 
traded horses and seafaring vessels for <i>teleport </i>spells and other forms of expeditious magical travel, allowing them to hop between these cities as they please.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Mulmaster is a decadent sprawl riddled with crime and 
corruption. Mulmasterites believe their neighbors plot against them, and
 the city has long felt isolated from the rest of the Moonsea. Fear 
breeds intrigue, and nefarious schemes abound in Mulmaster. Characters 
who come to the city hoping to skirt the intrigues of the Red Wizards 
and the Zhentarim will be gravely disappointed, since both organizations
 figure prominently in the quests described in this chapter. Thay and 
Zhentil Keep have important long-term plans for Mulmaster, and PCs who 
meddle in their affairs might find themselves caught in the middle or 
impaled on the business end of an assassin's blade.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Mulmaster is a predominantly evil place filled with evil
 people. Good-aligned characters should never feel entirely welcome or 
comfortable here. That said, Mulmaster needs adventurers as much as any 
city. To keep the PCs interested in Mulmaster (and to keep them coming 
back), you will need to tread carefully and allow them room to conduct 
their affairs without interference. If spies and assassins harangue them
 constantly, their interest in the city will evaporate. To help invest 
the PCs in Mulmaster, have the city reach out to them occasionally. 
Establish strong ties between the characters and certain individuals and
 locations within the city. For example, upon hearing that a new group 
of adventurers has arrived, clerics at the Temple of Tymora might extend
 their friendship by offering the PCs discounted healing potions and 
scrolls. Similarly, characters might bond with a morally ambiguous or 
morally challenged NPC who doesn't regard them as a threat -- someone 
who can help them navigate the city's labyrinthine political landscape. 
Look for occasions to subtly alter the PCs' perceptions of the people 
who live here. An evil noble might suffer a crisis of conscience and 
come to them seeking redemption. An assassin hired to eliminate them 
might spare their lives for no reason other than he admires their 
willingness to sacrifice all for a city that doesn't deserve their 
affection. Paint Mulmaster as a city worth saving, and the characters 
might be persuaded to stay for a time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In short, there isn't much good in Mulmaster. With good 
folk in such short supply, evil tends to prey on itself. Several of the 
short adventures in this chapter revolve around the mounting conflict 
between the Red Wizards of Thay and the Zhentarim. As the story unfolds,
 characters will have opportunities to hinder and help both groups 
through their actions and involvement, even if Mulmaster itself cannot 
be saved.</p>
