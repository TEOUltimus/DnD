<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The Moonsea is rich, indeed . . . gold and jewels, 
valuable pelts, and old ruins ripe for plundering. But it is a hard 
place to live -- cold, brutal, and dangerous, and it makes the men who 
live there into something much the same, tempering the soft iron of 
their spirits into cold, sharp steel. The people of the Moonsea are hard
 and unforgiving because if they weren't they'd be dead at the hands of 
monsters, tyrants, or the cruel turns of nature herself."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">-- Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Dare -- and beware!"</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">-- Moonsea battle cry</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>How to Use This Book</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Mysteries of the Moonsea </i>takes a different approach from other regional <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 books; it's a box of ready-to-use campaign pieces rather than an 
instruction manual on how to make those pieces yourself. Instead of you 
having to read an entire regional book and then come up with your own 
campaign based on that region, this book gives you the basic background 
information you need to run a campaign in the area and provides you with
 a large number of completed adventures from which to pick and choose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Rather than a comprehensive description of every person, place, and thing in the Moonsea region, <i>Mysteries of the Moonsea </i>focuses
 on four main cities and provides scores of miniadventures (sometimes 
called "quests" hereafter) for a Moonsea-based campaign. Each quest is 
tied to a particular part of the Moonsea, and some have links to one or 
more other quests in that area or another area, allowing you to string 
them together into a long campaign starting at 1st level and ending 
around 18th level. Roughly half of the quests are set in or very close 
to one of the four main cities, and the other half are located farther 
away.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The quests have a lot of overlap in terms of character 
level, which allows you to pick and choose appropriate adventures for 
your PCs based on their abilities and interests and what sort of 
campaign you want to run. For example, if you're planning a city 
campaign you can just use the in-city quests, while a group of heroes 
consisting of barbarians, druids, and rangers might enjoy all of the 
outlying quests and only rarely enter the cities. The overlapping quests
 and the many links allow you to build a nonlinear adventure that 
responds to the actions the PCs take. It's possible to run an entire 
campaign using only half of the included quests, and run a later (or 
simultaneous) campaign using the other half, with each set of PCs 
hearing about the other's activities and sometimes helping or hindering 
each other. You can also plan to use all forty adventures in one 
campaign, particularly if the PCs deal with plot elements quickly or 
prefer combat adventures rather than themes involving diplomacy, 
intrigue, and mystery.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because the quests are self-contained, you can also use 
them for stand-alone "side treks" in campaigns set elsewhere in Faer√ªn 
-- for example, a Dalelands campaign might divert into the southern 
Moonsea area and deal with one of the quests there, an Anauroch campaign
 might make use of one of the Zhentarim quests in the western Moonsea, 
and so on. Some city quests might fit well in another city entirely. 
Finally, with so many <i>portals </i>all over Faer√ªn, it's quite possible for the PCs to stumble across a Moonsea quest through a <i>portal, </i>either
 returning to their original location when they're done or sticking 
around to follow up on the links to other Moonsea quests.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Book Organization</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">After the remaining short explanatory text at the 
beginning of this introduction section, the book gives an overview of 
the territory around the Moonsea, expanding on the information presented
 in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting. </i>The remaining 
four chapters cover one of the four rough quadrants of the Moonsea, 
starting with low-level adventures and culminating in high-level 
adventures: North (focusing on Melvaunt), south (focusing on Hillsfar), 
east (focusing on Mulmaster), and west (focusing on Zhentil Keep). The 
expanded Moonsea map on page 7 shows the general borders for each of 
these quadrants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each chapter starts with a short geographical overview 
of the quadrant, then follows with several pages of more detailed 
information on its primary city-state, giving you key locations, city 
demographics, influential groups, and full game statistics for several 
level-appropriate villains. Following the villains is a list of rumors 
the PCs can overhear using skill checks (some of which are false or red 
herrings, some of which are plot hooks to various quests or other 
quadrants). Next are location-based quests set within or immediately 
nearby the city, followed by another set of quests that take place in 
outlying areas of the quadrant.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>DM Navigation Tips</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The easiest way to navigate the book is to determine 
what adventure levels you're looking for and jump to that chapter. The 
north quadrant (Chapter 1) is for PCs of 1st-7th level, the south 
(Chapter 2) is for 6th-12th level, the east (Chapter 3) is for 9th-14th 
level, and the west (Chapter 4) is for 12th-18th level. If you plan to 
run a long campaign using this book, you'll start at the beginning and 
work your way back as the campaign progresses. The events in and around 
these adventures take place in the last half of the Year of Rogue 
Dragons (1373 DR).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Where to Start</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you're planning on running a campaign in the Moonsea,
 read the Moonsea Primer later in this introduction. Once you have a 
grip on the background material, figure out where you want to start the 
campaign or at what level you want the PCs to start (one greatly 
influences the other, at least if you don't want to modify the NPCs and 
monsters to suit a different party level), then pick the chapter 
appropriate to your answer and read up on that quadrant and its quests.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you're going to pick and choose material from this 
book for an ongoing campaign outside the Moonsea, you can skip the 
Moonsea Primer and jump right to the chapter that has quests for the 
target levels you need (see DM Navigation Tips in this introduction).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Work You Have To Do</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This book is not a super-adventure with one common plot 
linking it all together. It's not a detailed adventure path with 
comprehensive answers for many possible actions. It's up to you as the 
DM to help create solid links for the quests in this book so the PCs can
 go from one to another in the order you want. You'll also need to fill 
in some details depending on which aspects of the cities and quests they
 want to explore. You'll also need to watch what the players are doing 
and read up on the future quests to push the connections they might be 
interested in and deemphasize the ones that you don't want to pursue or 
are inappropriate for the party. This book provides a lot of component 
pieces that you can easily assemble, but you have to do the assembling 
-- here are the bricks, you provide the mortar and the elbow grease.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Mysteries of the Moonsea </i>assumes the PCs are good
 or at least neutral. Some quests expect that PCs will want to get 
involved to fight an injustice (such as freeing slaves), defend 
innocents (such as protecting a village from raiders), and the like, 
whereas many evil parties have no interest in such things, unless there 
is a profit to be made. If your campaign's PCs tend to be on the evil 
side, you'll need to modify the quests to suit their interests. In some 
cases the "villains" of each major city might end up as potential 
allies, or you could change the "villains" to be more neutral or good so
 as to remain obstacles for the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Moonsea Primer</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Before continuing in this section, familiarize yourself 
with the description of the Moonsea region provided on pages 159-165 of 
the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i><b>.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Facts to Keep In Mind</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weather: </b>Moonsea is located in the northern part 
of Faer√ªn. While not as cold as the Silver Marches, it is much cooler 
than the Dalelands or Waterdeep, and people dress warmly all year round 
(a fur cape or cloak is a common article of clothing in the Moonsea). 
Anyone who walks around in light clothing during cold weather is 
obviously either a fool or someone who is using magic to stay warm and 
doesn't care if people know it (and thus a fool). Minor magic items that
 protect against the cold, such as rings or potions that give resistance
 3 against nonlethal damage caused by cold, are in common use among the 
wealthier people of the Moonsea, who enjoy not having to wear bulky 
clothing all the time (and these people are the ones who can afford 
bodyguards to protect them from robbers who would take such luxuries 
from them). The lake itself is fed by glacial meltwater and even in 
summer it can be cold enough to kill a swimmer. Because of this, most 
people who make their living on the water can't swim, since they've 
never had the opportunity to practice; instead, they have learned more 
practical skills such as fire building and how to not fall out of a 
boat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the winter months much of the sea freezes over, 
making travel across the ice possible but (due to the great distances 
involved) not very common. The larger cities sometimes use icebreaking 
ships, summoned monsters, or fire magic to keep their dock areas 
somewhat clear of ice, though this is impractical on a large scale. Ice 
fishing is common, with fishermen walking to their favorite spots rather
 than boating. The first snow usually falls in early to middle Uktar, 
and the land is consistently snowy from Nightal to Alturiak, with 
occasional snowfalls happening through Tarsakh.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The frequent cold and limited technology means that 
Moonsea inns usually have a small number of large rooms rather than a 
large number of small rooms; this reduces the number of individual 
fireplaces needed and the overall risk of fire. Some inns have just one 
large common room heated by a large hearth. This means these places have
 less privacy than a typical adventurer's inn but attacks are less 
likely because there are so many witnesses. The places with smaller 
rooms tend to use closed metal braziers full of hot coals to offset the 
chill.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Refer to Cold Dangers, <i>DMG </i>302, for more 
information on dealing with cold environments. Summers usually are not 
cold enough to be considered a cold hazard (with highs about 60¬∞F, 
16¬∞C). Spring and autumn are routinely in the cold weather category 
(40¬∞F, 4¬∞C or below), and winter is usually in the severe cold category 
(0¬∞F, -18¬∞C or below), often dipping into extreme cold (below -20¬∞F, 
-29¬∞C) several times over the course of the winter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because of the natural cold, those who have the means to
 magically protect themselves against cold (such as adventurers, 
spellcasters, and other wealthy folk) often do so, and in turn are aware
 that their enemies might have similar protection. This means that 
magic-using NPCs are less likely to use cold attacks. since doing so is 
often a waste of time (though the followers of Auril, unpopular even in 
the Moonsea, would disagree). PCs who gird themselves against magical 
cold in anticipation of many "cold mages" in the area might be surprised
 that <i>fireball </i>and <i>lightning bolt </i>are just as common here as in warmer lands.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>City-States: </b>Because of the danger of bandits, 
monsters, and military rivals, civilized populations gather in large 
settlements and behind walls for protection and comfort; every town has 
at least a wooden palisade wall. Adventurers traveling cross-country are
 much less likely to stumble across a hamlet or village here than 
elsewhere in Faer√ªn. Most settlements don't allow visitors after dark, 
and some even refuse entry to strangers during the day except under 
special circumstances -- even visiting merchants must make their deals 
outside the town wall.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Monsters: </b>Though most parts of Faer√ªn have at 
least occasional problems with marauding monsters, the Moonsea is 
particularly dangerous in this regard. Surrounded by old mountains and 
ancient forests, and divided by a mysterious deep sea, the land here has
 more than its fair share of strange beasts. In particular, the lake was
 once called the Sea of Dragons because of the many dragons that came 
here to mate; its forests and mountains are still riddled with dragon 
lairs. Moonsea folk do not scoff at rumors of monsters -- they tighten 
their belts, sharpen their swords, and expect the worst. Monster 
trophies do not impress them; such things hang in the main hall of most 
towns that have managed to survive for more than a few years.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Religion: </b>The common faiths of the Moonsea 
reflect its dangerous nature; most of the gods worshiped here are of the
 "worship me or bad things will happen to you" variety, and the rest 
fall into the "worship me or I will do bad things to you" category. 
Whether overt or subtle, these faiths influence how the local people 
think. Visitors who worship bright and noble gods are likely to be 
scoffed at behind their backs, while those who worship "frivolous" 
deities such as Eldath, Lliira, Milil, Sharess, and Sune are often 
derided to their face. Adventurers who proselytize "foreign" religions 
quickly draw the attention of Banite loyalists and others who openly 
serve the evil deities favored here. Most Moonsea folk pay lip service 
to these deities just to keep potential threats away, not necessarily 
fully embracing the dark philosophies of these deities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Suspicion: </b>Because of their frontier situation 
and the many threats in the Moonsea (particularly from rival 
city-states), the people of the region are mistrustful of any stranger, 
since any unknown person could be a spy or assassin from a rival 
settlement. Unlike other harsh lands where a culture of hospitality to 
all became the norm for the sake of survival, the Moonsea folk have more
 of a "take care of your own" attitude. This also makes them reluctant 
to turn to outsiders for help except under great duress, or when they 
have no questions about a person's motivations (for example, even in the
 Moonsea a paladin of Torm is someone you can trust to help you without 
an ulterior motive). Strangers must prove their worth before earning 
even a small measure of free hospitality. While the people of the 
Moonsea are not inherently evil or distrustful (any more than the people
 of the Dales are inherently friendly and good), that is the attitude 
bred into them by a culture where survival is hard work and the 
kind-hearted are usually taken advantage of.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>How to Introduce the Region</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The best way to express the feel of the Moonsea is in 
real-world terms. If you combine the "harsh land makes a strong people" 
themes of the Viking civilization with the "we will persevere against 
adversity" attitude of the pre-Soviet Russian commoners and the 
strike-it-rich frenzy of the California gold rush, you get a reasonable 
approximation of the region's temperament. Civilized humans settle there
 in the hopes of becoming rich or at least living well; they remain out 
of stubbornness to an almost fatalistic extent, and continue to prosper 
in each generation because those who work hard succeed -- and because 
failure means death. The Moonsea is not a nice or safe place to live; 
its settlers are driven people who want make their own choices about 
their lives, were driven out of their old lands, or know that they are 
the ones who will triumph.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When running a Moonsea campaign, try to reinforce those 
three themes. The people of the Moonsea aren't helpless and are content 
to solve their problems themselves. If they can't solve it themselves 
they'll endure tyrants or threats in the interest of long-term survival.
 All of them know that fate could tip the balance in their favor any day
 now and they'll be rewarded for their hard work. Local PCs should 
represent these qualities. Foreign PCs should encounter these qualities 
often as a contrast to your typical Faer√ªnian peasant. Moonsea folk are 
not foolish or stupid, just very determined to beat the odds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What You Need to Use This Book</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">To use this supplement, you need the three D&amp;D core rulebooks -- <i>Player's Handbook (PH)</i>, <i>Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG), </i>and <i>Monster Manual (MM) -- </i>in addition to the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting (FRCS). </i>Because some of the characters here use the revised regional feats and prestige classes presented in the <i>Player's Guide to Faer√ªn </i>(PG), you will find that book helpful. Some of the NPCs presented here use spells from <i>Player's Guide to Faer√ªn, Magic of Faer√ªn </i>(Mag) or <i>Unapproachable East </i>(Una),
 but none of those spells are critical to using those NPCs, so you can 
swap out those spells for others if you don't have those books. In 
addition, many of these spells were updated and included in <i>Spell Compendium </i>(SC), so you can refer to those versions if you have that book.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Several encounters are magical locations, which are a new type of resource explained fully in <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II, </i>though all the information on the locations in this book is provided for you, and <i>DMG II </i>is optional (though you might find it useful for modifying the locations or creating your own).</p>
