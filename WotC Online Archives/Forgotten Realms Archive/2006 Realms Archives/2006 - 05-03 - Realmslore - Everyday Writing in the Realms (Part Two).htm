<p align="LEFT"><b>"Should I use Vangey's toy again?" Azoun asked his queen. "Or explore a bit?"</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>He hefted the sword in his hand, and Filfaeril smiled a little, sighed, and replied, "Explore. What else?"</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>"What else, indeed," the Purple Dragon said eagerly, 
striding off into the darkness. He was heading in the direction the 
tortoise had come from; Queen Filfaeril gave the doggedly trudging 
little beast a swift look of farewell as the heavy gloom swallowed it, 
and hurried after her husband, hoping she'd reach his side swiftly 
enough to keep him out of trouble.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>For once.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Ink</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Ink that doesn't fade is pricey, except along seacoasts 
where certain snails, squids, and octopi can be gleaned easily. The 
"ink" of the latter two species or the crushed shells of the snails are 
base ingredients in most writing inks. This ink base is usually mixed 
with a substance to keep it from drying (into a hard cake or a powder, 
in the vial) too swiftly or when exposed to extremes of heat and cold, 
and an ingredient to inhibit fading. Just what these two sorts of 
ingredients are varies from region to region across Faerûn, but they are
 all either plant distillates or powdered minerals.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Colored inks have a blend of additional pigment 
ingredients, plus something to keep the "base" ink from separating from 
the pigments.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Inks used for writing spells are far more complex and 
expensive, but usually begin with a base of the finest "everyday" ink, 
unless wyvern blood or harpy blood or another "base" fluid is available.
 Their recipes are valuable, carefully guarded secrets, and usually 
involve costly and hard-to-obtain ingredients. Some sages assert that 
everyday ink can be used to write spells just as well as special inks, 
but many scribes, wizards, and priests of Azuth, Mystra, Oghma, and 
Deneir firmly disagree, claiming that everyday inks "melt away" over 
time due to magical stresses, this time being measured in a handful of 
days for the most powerful spells.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ink that fades over time or with exposure to heat or 
light, on the other hand, can be made readily almost anywhere in the 
Realms that isn't frozen or desert terrain, from many, many vegetable 
and wild plant sources (anything from beets to certain forest leaves). 
However, the methods of making inks are usually secret, and none of them
 are swift or easy (powdering and boiling specific parts of a plant are 
always involved, with precise temperatures and timings).</p>
<p align="LEFT">As a result, an ounce of will-fade ink tends to sell for
 as much as 4 gp, except at places and times when nonfading ink is 
available in ready abundance (which depresses the price to as low as 2 
gp/vial). An ounce of will-fade colored ink tends to cost 6 or 7 gp 
(metallic hues and striking reds are more highly desired and hence more 
costly).</p>
<p align="LEFT">A 1-ounce vial of nonfading black ink costs 8 gp, and 
one of nonfading colored ink 16 to 20 gp, depending on hue. The prices 
of spell inks tend to begin at 45 gp/ounce and escalate swiftly, most 
selling for around 75 gp/ounce.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Archival Records</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">As a result of the properties of writing substances, 
parchment tends to get used for human archival records and legal or 
official documents, and rag paper for short-term commentary or 
record-keeping. Dwarves and gnomes produce graven-with-runes stone 
tablets or stamped metal alloy plaques or pages for "permanent" writing.
 Certain human guilds also make plaques or certifications by stamping 
metal (often copper) with letter- or symbol-shaped punches.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Tally-Sticks and Temporary Writing</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">To cut down on furious disputes over payments, counting 
is done with "tally-sticks" and with chalk (where chalk is readily 
available) or by scratching, in both cases marking lines on a stick in 
an agreed-upon fashion, one stroke being one unit, and longer strokes 
with crossed ends or circles having meanings (for example, ten or twenty
 or a hundred) set by various costers, guilds, and royal decrees. Folk 
keep their own tally-sticks, and they often jointly create a new, 
specially marked (usually with a carved or painted head) stick for an 
agreement between them. Guilds and temples often "safekeep" tally-sticks
 (for nominal fees of 1 cp/year, payable up front and with any 
outstanding balance due upon retrieval) to prevent loss or tampering.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most writing used in negotiations, imparting directions, or teaching is done by drawing temporarily in sand, snow, mud, or wax.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Memory Marks and Tale-Tallies</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The great majority of folk in the Realms don't have the 
luxury of having anything to write on except a stick, a tree, a stone, 
or the wall, so one of the skills taught to them from childhood (often 
by grandparents, or village elders) is memorization: fixing things in 
their minds by looking at a drawn symbol or remembering a rhyming chant 
or pithy saying. Farm-folk often scratch important records or symbols on
 stones that form the "floor" of their cottage or hearth; the stones are
 then put back into place with the written-on side facedown. More than 
once, a hastily scratched likeness of a badge or banner found on such a 
stone is the only record left behind of who raided an outlying hamlet 
and slaughtered everyone.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some novice minstrels go about with sticks thrust into 
their boots (akin to the manner in which real-world marching-band 
drummers carry spare drumsticks slid down their socks) that are 
decorated with a series of symbols. Each symbol on such a "tale-tally" 
is a reminder of a key scene in a famous or stirring story, so a 
minstrel can pull out a stick that's meaningless to most people and 
"read" the outline of a story they can embellish in the telling. Bards 
can often pick up an unfamiliar tally-stick and identify the story it's 
telling at a glance.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Our next column will leave matters of recording 
behind, and turn in quite a different direction. As will, most likely, 
the King and Queen of Cormyr.</i></p>
