<p align="LEFT"><b>Dapplegate</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2006-28%20-%20The%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Dapplegate_files/fx0628bk_borderkingdoms_dapplegate.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="226" width="325">This
 independent, large town stands on the northern border of Bedorn, and it
 is slowly falling under the influence of that peace-loving realm. 
Borderers know Dapplegate as a pleasant place of cobbled streets and 
solid, three-story stone buildings where merchants rule (in a council of
 forty that can never agree on much of anything) and fill the town with 
cheerful bustle at all hours.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Native Dapplans can sleep through anything thanks to 
crafters hammering through the night and the din of wagons and 
pull-carts groaning and rumbling endlessly through the streets -- this 
town never sleeps. Dapplegate's resident craftfolk make superb 
stormlanterns (of wrought iron or brass with glass panes and hanging 
chains), adequate chain, and rough but sturdy crates and chests for the 
transport of bulk goods. Most businesses are open night and day, staffed
 in three shifts, busily selling Borderers all that Calimshan and more 
distant lands have to offer and buying Border goods for export. Goods 
are hauled north to wharves along the left bank of the River Scelptar 
for shipment via barges. The riverbanks in that area are so marshy and 
insect-infested that there are no other Borderer settlements there. 
Lizard folk and mudmaws battle for supremacy, and no less than six 
mercenary companies based in Dapplegate are kept busy providing 
protective escort duty for bargebound shipments.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All of this makes Dapplegate a worthwhile stop for 
shoppers seeking variety of wares (often an elusive quality in the 
Border Kingdoms), but hardly an exciting place for the romantic or 
adventurous.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That need is fulfilled by Danchilaer the Mad Mage, a 
reclusive sorcerer from afar who came to dwell in Dapplegate four 
centuries ago (some sages say the town grew up around his tower, after 
folk staying at the nearby Dapplegate Inn struck bargains with the 
sorcerer to protect them with spells in return for payments of money, 
cooked food, and lifting-and-carrying service around the tower).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Visitors to Dapplegate are directed to the Place of 
Arrows (the central marketplace and the site of a long-ago battle 
between rival companies of archers). There, stalls of traveling 
merchants crowd together inside a ring of eight circular, waist-high, 
walled ponds (for watering draft animals).</p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="center"><b>The Mad Mage</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Danchilaer the Mad Mage (LN male Halruaan human 
Wiz21/Sor6/Arch5) is a reclusive renegade from Halruaa who dwelt in 
Dapplegate four hundred years ago and is now either undead or long-lived
 indeed. His simple, slender tower stands dark and empty (except for 
occasional roaming bands of adventurers seeking treasure in its trapped,
 labyrinthine chambers and cellars), but Danchilaer remains an unseen, 
watchful presence in town. Once a year or so, he magically abducts a 
lone human resident or visitor and sets them a task somewhere in the 
Border Kingdoms.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the chosen person succeeds, Danchilaer somehow 
magically augments their personal abilities permanently and returns them
 from whence they came, charging them with a long-term goal or mission. 
Whether they follow his guidance or not, the Mad Mage haunts their 
lives, appearing in dreams to give cryptic advice or answering when they
 call on him in great need with a spell, spoken message, or helpful 
advice whispered in their minds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Danchilaer appears as a tall, deep-voiced man in plain 
robes, whose face is always hidden by his pulled-down cowl. He's amoral,
 but neither insane nor malicious. His true aims are unknown, but the 
tasks and goals he sets seem dedicated to the survival of Dapplegate, 
the Border Kingdoms (as a region of free, everchanging realms, subject 
to no outside rule), and self-sufficient farming folk everywhere. He 
works against large armies, proud kings, and vast empires. Those who 
serve him are free to pursue their own lives and don't necessarily know 
of others the Mad Mage has "augmented." (Danchilaer is not building an 
organized group of agents.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Yet several successful adventurers and mages now 
contemplating retirement to the Border Kingdoms have begun to meet for 
drinks and converse at various taverns about the Border lands in a sort 
of unnamed, unofficial social club -- and more than once, certain 
members of this group have acted together to foil petty rulers or stop 
unscrupulous mercenaries or merchants. Only the years ahead will tell if
 the Mad Mage has some larger plan or intends to forge those he has 
aided into some sort of cohesive force. If he does, the Border Kingdoms 
could well be changed forever.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Overlooking the Place of Arrows is Danchilaer's Tower, 
standing immediately northwest of the market in its own walled garden 
(which it shares with ancient, massive, stunted oaks, a cairn 
commemorating the Valiant Fallen of Dapplegate in the many wars that 
have raged across the region, and -- at most times -- many children of 
the town at play).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beside the Tower is the round, turreted Council Hall, an
 ungainly pile of a building that has flung out wings in all directions 
over the years as kitchens, meeting-rooms, and rental storage 
lockchambers for visitors have been added haphazardly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Facing the Hall across Lockwyvern Street is The Chased 
Unicorn (not, as some travelers think, The Chaste Unicorn), an inn 
(Excellent/Expensive) offering superior dining and fairly luxurious 
appointments, including gaming rooms, private baths, and chamber 
service. Such accommodations are rare in the Border Kingdoms -- and 
priced accordingly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most visitors stay at one of the three less expensive 
(and more spartan) inns just inside the town gates. Hard by Bedorn Gate 
is <i>The Old Tin Tankard </i>(not, despite its name, a tavern; Good/Moderate). Just inside Easting Gate is <i>The Watchful Warrior</i> (large, new, noisy, and bright; Fair/Moderate), and beside the River Gate is <i>Mistfall House</i>
 (which many folk in town suspect has something to do with the Harpers; 
known Harpers stay there when in town; Excellent/Moderate). The best 
tavern in town is <i>Black Blasko's</i> on Sharaghil Street (Good/Moderate). The most raucous and shady is <i>Tarnalar's Tipple</i> on Bloodserpent Lane (Poor/Moderate).</p>
<p align="LEFT">A disturbing rumor has recently spread across the Border
 Kingdoms -- somewhere in Dapplegate is the hidden tomb of Quarlin, a 
Halruaan wizard who specialized in making magical staves -- lots of 
staves, all of which unleashed battle magic. Five hundred years after 
his death (in other words, right about now), Qualrin's tomb and bones 
will collapse into dust as a long-slumbering spell activates, but the 
staves buried with him (twenty or more, the tales insist) will survive, 
free for the taking by whoever finds them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Just where this rumor came from, and how much truth is 
behind it, remain mysteries, but adventurers are converging on 
Dapplegate from all over the Border Kingdoms (finding accomodations in 
Dapplegate is likely to be difficult for some time). There have already 
been several violent confrontations between persistent stave-searchers 
and suspicious merchants trying to protect their goods and property. 
Merchants' bodyguards and warehouse guards take a very dim view of 
adventurers digging (or breaking and entering) anywhere in town.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The increasing tension and violence between prying 
adventurers and newly-hired bodyguards and warehouse security forces has
 moved Master Merchant Nurath Cheldin of the Council (CE male Calishite 
human Rog2/Exp6; darkly handsome with sharp features and oiled black 
hair and beard; active in goods shipping, moneylending, barter, and the 
sale of fine locks and chains) to publicly decree that there is not now,
 nor has there ever been, a Halruaan wizard's tomb in Dapplegate, and 
that adventurers would do well to hunt known monsters and treasures 
rather than chasing after every wild tavern-tale that passes through 
their ears.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Prominent tavern-owner and fellow Council member Tilbar 
Tarnalar (NE male Illuskan human Exp4; blond, moon-faced, 
innocent-looking; owner of Tarnalar's Tipple and several more warehouses
 that most Dapplans don't know he owns) responded by issuing a statement
 that he knows of no less than <i>seven</i> hidden Halruaan tombs in 
town and suspects that Dapplegate's cellars hold several -- perhaps many
 -- more. He advised that citizens should not hesitate to call on the 
Council for help if they encounter strange magic or witness the use of 
any magical staff.</p>
