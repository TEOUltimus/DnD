<p><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frbk/20061108a">High Emmerock</a>,
 a region of high, grassy meadows suited for grazing livestock and one 
of the more prosperous Border Kingdoms, is ruled by a council of seven 
Lords of the Lance. Present members of the council are listed below 
(note that individuals of either gender are styled Lord).</p>
<ul><img src="2006%20-%2011-15%20-%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20High%20Emmerock%20pt.%202_files/dnd_frbk_20061108a_emmer.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="227" width="325"><li>Haldimar
 Brethok (a noble, dashing, gallant LG male Mulan human Ftr16), Lord of 
the Blue Falcon, who dwells in Falconkeep in northwesternmost High 
Emmerock.</li>
<li>Azlurla Marounal (a quiet, grim, darkly beautiful CG female 
Calishite human Ftr14/Wiz6), Lord of the Wavewatch, who lives in 
Wavewatch Tower on a peak (Nightwind Pinnacle) overlooking the village 
of Nightwind and the Lake of Steam beyond, in northern High Emmerock. 
She set aside warfare to learn magic under the tutelage of the Water 
Witch over a decade ago.</li>
<li>Gorramator Margan (a mighty-thewed, rustic, and gruff LN male 
Chultan human Ftr17 who is determined his land will never be unprepared 
to deal with invaders), Lord of Oldstones, of Oldstones Hall in rocky, 
northeasternmost High Emmerock.</li>
<li>Lastos Teldoak (a fat, food-loving, lazy-seeming but shrewd LN male 
Durpari human Ftr10 who delights in parties, spectacles, and fun -- but 
uses them to shrewdly sum up the characters of those around him -- and 
who delights in learning covertly the dreams and future plans of all 
residents of the realm), Lord of Eagles, who dwells in palatial 
Reddunsar Manor (known for its shady, wooded gardens of falling streams 
and pools) atop the Eaglesroost, a wooded ridge in High Emmerock.</li>
<li>Soarara "Longtresses" Phondipar (a sharp-tongued but fun-loving, 
slim, acrobatic, golden-haired NG female Chondathan human Ftr15 who 
stands almost seven feet tall and is said to have storm giant blood in 
her ancestry), Lord of the Vale, who dwells in Silverstream Hall in 
Boldo's Vale at the southeastern edge of the realm. Boldo was the most 
crude and boisterous of the Kings of the Sward and is fondly remembered 
in jests and legends.</li>
<li>Jethtarina Aldinuth, Hammer of Helm (soft-spoken, calm in any 
situation, and a woman who never forgets the slightest detail of events,
 messages, or faces; an outwardly colorless but inwardly passionate and 
pranksome LN female Damaran human Clr16: a "Bulwark of Helm"), Lord of 
the Tower of Vigil (Helmite monastery) atop Harethtoe Tor on the 
southern edge of High Emmerock.</li>
<li>Belotar Sandras (a saturnine, sarcastic fashion plate always 
immersed in the gossip and politics of Calimshan, the Lake of Steam, and
 the Tashalar; a CN male Mulan human Ftr12), Lord of the Crag, master of
 Dragonmount Crag Castle in westernmost High Emmerock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested travelers should know that Falconkeep stands over the 
small village of Irsprey, known for its smiths and woodcarvers. Amid its
 hillocks, shady stands of trees, and winding lanes, the only tavern is 
the Old Anvil (Fair/Cheap), and its sole inn is Gunderbar's Place 
(Fair/Moderate).</p>
<p>Wavewatch Tower stands on Nightwind Pinnacle above the village of 
Nightwind. Known for its sapphire miners and stonecutters, this spartan 
settlement of stone cottages and drystone-walled gardens is surrounded 
by quarries and boasts the Nightwind Tavern (Excellent/Moderate) and 
Stand of Stones Inn (Good/Moderate).</p>
<p>Oldstones Hall overlooks a sheep-herding village, Ornryl, known for 
its smelly but long-lasting tallow candles (treated with a secret 
mixture of ground stone and crushed plant juices to burn slowly and hold
 their shape) and its smoked and jellied lamb meat (sold in tins all 
around the Lake of Steam). Wool is sent to the mills of Catanthar. 
Ornryl has two small taverns, a family gathering-place known as 
Stulgin's Stook (Good/Cheap) and The Happy Homonculous (Good/Moderate, 
named for a long-ago local mage-related event). The Happy Homonculous is
 a rough watering hole where ladies dance and sing for guests and 
outland visitors, who are directed hence.</p>
<p>The Eaglesroost, where Reddunsar Manor nestles in its wooded gardens,
 rises above the fast-growing, prosperous village of Catanthar. "The 
Cat" is the closest thing High Emmerock has to a craftworkers' town -- 
or a town of any size, for that matter. It is also the only settlement 
in High Emmerock to have named streets. Catanthar is home to carpenters,
 smiths, wool-millers, and makers of roof tiles and cobbles. Among its 
winding streets, which are fast becoming constantly crowded, are a pair 
of taverns and another of inns. The Mace &amp; Mattock (Good/Moderate) 
on Thurdan's Street is the older, cleaner, and quieter of the two 
taverns. The louder, more boisterous drinkers go to the Just As I Was 
Falling (Fair/Cheap) on Iythkyn Street. Both of the inns are apt to be 
noisy, but the more exclusive of the two is the Enchantment of Emmerock 
(Excellent/Expensive) on Shool Street. The busier accomodation is that 
afforded by The Galloping Stallion (Good/Moderate) on Sward Way.</p>
<p>Boldo's Vale is heavily settled, with the oldest surviving homes in 
the realm. Its cottages are so bedecked with flowers and ornamental 
ponds and plantings that it is sometimes called "the Hidden Garden of 
the Border Kingdoms." Amidst all this pastoral beauty winds Engullar's 
Way, the road down into the rest of the Border realms. Along it one can 
find all of the shops, smithies, cheesemakers, and other establishments 
of the Vale, including: the popular The Laughing King tavern and dining 
hall (Excellent/Moderate), the more rustic Old Ox tavern (Good/Cheap), 
the Sylph and Stars festhall (visited by dancers and lovers of 
minstrelry from all over the Border lands), and two inns -- the Bright 
Buckle Beds (Good/Moderate) and the more rustic Green Griffon 
(Good/Cheap).</p>
<p>The village of Harethtoe stands on the southern edge of High 
Emmerock, astride the road from Dunbridges. A rather spartan, 
no-nonsense trading center, it was founded to sell the sapphires, smoked
 meats, and livestock of the realm to visiting merchants and buy their 
finecloth and ironmongery. Both activities take place under the 
ever-watchful eye of the Helmite clergy. Harethtoe was built for 
defense, with concentric ring-walls, defensible gates and towers, wide 
cobbled streets, and all-stone construction with slate roofs. Nothing 
will readily burn, and any attackers must climb a series of rising 
cobbled slopes (despite anything slippery that's been poured underfoot) 
while the villagers fire crossbows down their throats. Harethtoe has one
 tavern, Obolder's Tankard (Good/Expensive), and a single (large) inn, 
the Southshield (Good/Expensive). Both are policed diligently by Helmite
 priests to keep order. Most visiting merchants chafe at the attentive 
watch kept over them at first but come to welcome the quiet, nearly 
crimeless setting.</p>
<p>The village of Dragonmount lies just east of Dragonmount Crag (topped
 by the Lord's castle). It is a place of woodcarvers, butchers, and 
shepherds famous for its spiced, smoked meats. It offers the visitor The
 Flying Unicorn tavern and festhall (Good/Moderate) and the Shanduth's 
Hall inn (Excellent/Moderate). Shanduth's Hall is popular with 
adventurers because its frail, aged proprietress, Shanduth, (CG female 
Calishite human Ftr6/Sor9) was a notable adventurer in her day. She 
provides advice, gear, aid for the injured, and discreet help in shadier
 dealings.</p>
