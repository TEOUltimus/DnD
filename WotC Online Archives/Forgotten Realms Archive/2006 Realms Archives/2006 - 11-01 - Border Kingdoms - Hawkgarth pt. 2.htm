<p>Travelers will find Hawkgarth a land of prosperous cherry and apple 
farms, many woodlots, and winding lanes stretching along the southern 
bank of the River Scelptar for quite some distance. In short, it's a 
beautiful land.</p>
<p>Beautiful, but frustrating to those who want to easily find seats of 
wealth and power. Settlements of the sort travelers usually find are 
unknown in Hawkgarth; everything is spread out. Most travelers 
eventually find their ways to one or both of two crossroads: Ingletar at
 the west end of the realm or Ambrees at the east end.</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-01%20-%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Hawkgarth%20pt.%202_files/dnd_frbk_20061025a_hawkg.jpg" alt="Hawkgarth" title="Hawkgarth" align="right" border="0" height="227" width="325">Ingletar
 offers a horsepond; a blacksmith ("Orlag Harlagus, Shoes &amp; Froes");
 The Firefly Down inn (Good/Moderate); Three Sheaves Tower, a shrine to 
Chauntea; and a farm market that gathers once a tenday, where travelers 
can buy all the wares Hawkgarth produces and more (from traveling 
wagon-merchants).</p>
<p>Ambrees is home to Jalagar the Wheelwright, famous for his 
fine-quality wagon wheels; the Old Pipe and Pearls inn 
(Excellent/Moderate); and the cozy, superior Laughing Unicorn tavern, 
which is known for the dancing, glowing white unicorn illusion that 
appears briefly every midnight (thanks to a spell cast long ago by a 
Harper sorceress to give a sign to a friend she could wait no longer 
for). The Unicorn is a favorite of many traveling minstrels of Faerûn, 
and there's even a ballad about the welcoming sight of its flickering 
window-candles at the end of a long and dangerous ride.</p>
<p>The song's not all that fanciful, for the one thing Hawkgarth can 
boast for its farmers is that some of them are accomplished brigands. 
Their favored tactic is to lean down from overhanging tree-boughs to 
slice straps and lift away baggage or even cut a horse away from a team 
when the coachman is asleep -- or has been carried from his seat by a 
swinging, cloak-wielding bravo who swoops out of the trees, wraps the 
man's head in a smothering cloak, and carries him to the ground and a 
stunned slumber.</p>
<p>In some cases, coaches or goods-wagons have crashed down into ravines
 or into trees after brigands removed the coachman. The injured or dead 
occupants are dealt with at leisure by the cutpurses, who are then free 
to loot the goods or even right the wagon and drive it off to a remote 
barn for stripping.</p>
<p>There's an old Hawkgarthan tall tale about one brigand band doing 
this and then being attacked by a second band who mistook them for 
merchants. So few folk survived this clash in the darkness that only two
 bravos were left to take the wagon home, pulled by a single horse -- 
whereupon they were, of course, ambushed by a third cutpurse band.</p>
<p>In recent years, battlewise traveling mages have evened the score 
with some of the more notorious brigands, but the survivors have become 
more wily. Now, before attacking, they often observe travelers through 
several inn-stops along the road to learn just who they're casing. As 
always, travelers are cautioned to hide finery and keep boasting to a 
minimum, or they'll attract rough and ready attention they might prefer 
to avoid.</p>
<p>Not all Hawkgarthan farmers, of course, are the sort who'll stick a 
blade in a throat when night falls. Even those who prowl the forest 
lanes and high roads by night tend to be genuinely friendly and 
easy-going around the tavern-hearth during daylight.</p>
<p>All of this creeping about after dark can make Hawkgarth a busy place
 for lovers seeking seclusion, tramps seeking a quiet haystack to sleep 
in, and travelers on foot cutting cross-country to avoid unpleasantness 
-- or at least most of the unpleasantness. Many farmers have 
well-trained guard dogs that can growl and even bay but not bark. They 
tend to approach and spring silently, giving tongue only after striking.
 The spell known as <i>Darvo's dancing dogs </i>is said to have been 
born out of a strong desire of the warrior-mage Darvo to enjoy an 
uninterrupted haystack slumber one hot, summer night in deepest 
Hawkgarth.</p>
<h4>The Family Garthammus</h4>
<p>The reputation of Histokle's manor has led some folk to think 
Hawkgarth has no living mages of note. This is a mistake, of course. At 
the very heart of the realm, atop Wrinkled Hill, stands a modest cottage
 that is home to Ilden Garthammus and his wife Faelrae, who settled here
 after finding Lapiliiya too crowded for their liking. Faelrae is 
apparently a CG Tashalan human Wiz16 but is in truth a song dragon. 
Ilden seems to be a LG male Shaaran human Wiz16/Arch2 but reverts to his
 true silver dragon form when he feels the need.</p>
<p>That need usually arises either when a wizard decides that Hawkgarth 
looks ripe for being transformed into his or her domain (there have been
 several spectacular, midair spell-battles attendant on persuading such 
individuals that they're mistaken) or when an adventuring band, 
mercenary company, or (more rarely) neighboring ruler decides that 
Hawkgarth needs a new form of government -- to whit, them.</p>
<h4>Hawkgarthan Governance</h4>
<p>Hawkgarthans are quite content (as the Garthammus family forcibly 
points out) with their present system of government. All of the 
landowners in Hawkgarth nominate and vote for certain elders among them 
to be Speakers. To be named so, a candidate must get a thousand votes 
out of a population of not quite four thousand voting farmers.</p>
<p>Speakers propose laws and policies for the land in short, pithy 
speeches at twice-yearly meetings called moots. These are held atop 
Hawkgarth's Hill. Speakers call for votes, and the Senior Speaker 
(currently a frail, long-bearded LN male Sharran human Ftr6 by the name 
of Ammanas "Hawk" Halauklyn, who farms just down the road from the 
Floating Shadow Bog at Twotrees Bridge) tallies all "close counts." 
Enforcement of laws and the putting down of lawlessness is handled by 
the Garthammus family and by the Striking Hawks, some thirty local lads 
(all LN male human Ftr3-5s) who dwell on family farms near Wrinkled 
Hill.</p>
<p>Faelrae Garthammus crafted a spell that allows her and Ildren to hear
 the ten words that follow the utterance of their own names (together 
with the precise identity and location of the speaker) whenever any of 
the Speakers says either of their names within the borders of Hawkgarth.
 This magic also allows Ilden and Faelrae to hear each other in similar 
circumstances and further extends to the tongue of Athkalon Blaykin, the
 leader of the Striking Hawks.</p>
<h4>Local Lore and History</h4>
<p>Most local legends center on the "terrible haunted floating manor" 
("With these eyes, I've seen the bodies of dead adventurers falling from
 it many a night!") or concern the ghost of Hawkgarth striding forth 
from his tomb to right some wrong. Typical day-to-day Hawkgarthan rumors
 concern the latest dark plot of this or that nearby ruler who wants 
(again) to conquer Hawkgarth. These rumors are based on many previous 
attempts by various petty rulers in the Border Kingdoms to seize this 
region of rich, "unprotected" farmland.</p>
<p>Hawkgarth himself slaughtered a fair dozen would-be usurpers and died
 of the wounds he took hewing down most of the forces of the thirteenth 
pretender. After his bodyguard was ambushed and died to the last man and
 woman defending their king, Hawkgarth alone held a covered bridge over 
the River Mauraurin (today little more than a dry creekbed save during 
spring run-off) against the invaders. He killed over sixty enemy knights
 before dusk came and he threatened to call up the dead to fight with 
him, whereupon the pretender's forces fled.</p>
<p>Hard-riding knights found Hawkgarth a few hours later, leaning 
against one rail of the bridge, sword in hand and white as a ghost -- 
stone dead, his blood in a deep pool around him. One of them put on the 
King's armor, and the others mounted a guard around him. The invaders 
made one cautious foray in the new day, saw the King standing on the 
bridge with ready swords all around him, and decided to seek easier 
lands to rule.</p>
<p>The spot is still known as the Ghost Bridge. Hawkgarthans believe 
loyal subjects who were born in the realm can receive guidance there -- 
if they go to the bridge by night and humbly offer their sword to the 
King, it's said they will see the phantom of Hawkgarth the Mighty in his
 plate armor, sword in hand, and hear him whisper words of wisdom before
 he fades away.</p>
<h4>The Book of Beasts</h4>
<p>There is also a persistent local rumor that some anonymous farmer of 
Hawkgarth keeps a precious treasure hidden somewhere in the land: a <i>Book of Beasts</i>.
 This large, ancient tome is said to have been stolen from Histokle long
 ago. Bound about with lockable clasps, its pages display vivid 
paintings of monsters -- beasts that can be called forth from the book 
by those who touch a page and speak the proper phrase. Unfortunately, 
local belief holds (correctly) that the monsters that appear are in no 
way subject to the command of their summoner and typically attack 
everything in sight (except the book they came from). Such tomes were 
quite fashionable in Unther and Mulhorand centuries ago, and a few were 
made in the waning days of Netheril and the early days of Halruaa, but 
few survive into recent years.</p>
<h4>The Treasury of Houlongh Szoul</h4>
<p>Hawkgarth is widely (and correctly) rumored to be the place where the
 thieves who stole the treasury of the vizar Houlongh Szoul of Calimport
 fled to, and perished, decades ago. There were six thieves, and each 
stole an elegantly-carved ivory coffer of gems not knowing that Szoul 
had hired a mage to enchant each coffer with a tracer spell. Houlongh 
couldn't find the written instructions for activating the tracer for 
almost a tenday, which gave the thieves time to reach their homes in 
Hawkgarth and take their finds to a local mage, Dhalberstant Hurthurimm 
(at the time, a LN male Tethyrian human Wiz16) for examination.</p>
<p>In exchange for a tenth of the gems, Dhalberstant agreed to break any
 enchantments or curses laid on the stones, remove any poisons or traps,
 and forget all about ever having done so. He performed his part of the 
deal, reported the tracers to the thieves, and collected his payment. It
 is recorded by his apprentice, Shalara of the Streams (now a LN female 
Damaran human Wiz14) as being twenty-six rubies, "none smaller than my 
thumb;" forty-one sapphires "of like size;" and seventeen emeralds "a 
shade smaller than the other sorts of gems." Dhalberstant promptly 
ordered Shalara to undertake a long journey to Neverwinter, to search 
there for a certain magical substance he required. He then vanished "on a
 tour of the planes" (from which he has not yet returned, twenty-three 
years later). Shalara suspects that her master was fleeing any doom the 
satrap might send his way.</p>
<p>All six of the thieves were slain in Hawkgarth by invisible stalkers 
within a tenday of Dhalberstant's disappearance, but no trace of the 
coffers or the gems they held (presumably nine times the amount of the 
hoard Shalara now guards) was ever found. It is certain that Houlongh 
never recovered them, for he came seeking them with a large band of 
hired warriors and wizards and was slain with all his forces in 
Dhalberstant's mansion by Shalara when she returned from her mission 
(largely through her use of traps and magic items prepared by 
Dhalberstant for use in defending his mansion).</p>
<h4>Hawkgarth Today and Tomorrow</h4>
<p>Still bearing a reputation of being largely a wild wood roamed by 
monsters and inhabited by brigands who pounce on every visitor daring to
 venture along its roads, Hawkgarth is avoided by many outlanders -- 
except those hungry for treasure, who often find, once there, that many 
lesser-known tales of smaller treasures and secrets await the patiently 
inquisitive visitor.</p>
<p>Yet Hawkgarth remains largely a pastoral backwater. That suits most 
of its inhabitants. Its location nigh the confluence of the Rivers Rith 
and Scelptar (where a port on the south bank of the Scelptar could 
dominate all upriver shipping) and between other restless realms make 
its future quite likely to feature other would-be conquerors. It remains
 to be seen just how much success any invader can have in this realm of 
strong, independent local inhabitants.</p>
