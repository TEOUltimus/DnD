<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-09%20-%20The%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Emrys_files/borderkingdoms_emrys.jpg" alt="Emrys" title="Emrys" align="right" border="0" height="227" width="325">This
 large, fortified town is sometimes called "the Throat of Talduth Vale."
 It earned this name because it stands on the Sheep Road linking the 
Borders with the Shaar fringes that Vale farmers use as grazing land -- 
and because it forms a bottleneck for travelers. The countryside around 
Emrys is typical of the upland Vale (the less lush, more rolling part of
 Talduth Vale that lies along the Landrise where the lower lands of the 
Border Kingdoms become the high plateau of the Shaar). Small farms that 
raise sheep and root crops are laid out in a crazy-quilt of wandering 
lanes and irregularly-shaped fields separated by high fieldstone walls, 
with thorn trees and a few felsul standing where walls meet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Dominated by the massive and severe battlements of 
central Emrystarl's Keep, Emrys occupies a hill at the south end of 
cold, deep Emrysar Lake. Treacherous bogs drain into the lake from the 
north and stretch to the Dragonback, a long, sharp, distant ridge. 
Travelers going east or west must trek most of the way to Oeble to pass 
these natural barriers if they want to avoid Emrys. Most don't bother.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Taldans come to Emrys for protection in time of war 
(extensive underground caverns under Emrystarl's Keep contain armories 
and a stream of sweet water), for selling sheep and wool to outlanders 
in the Bawling Market (named for the din made by penned sheep), and for 
supplies (Emrys is Talduth Vale's main source of ironmongery, livestock 
feed, pottery, and large gear such as wagons). The town is prosperous. 
Well-stocked shops offer reasonable prices, and folk are always eager to
 buy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Defended by two concentric walls, Emrys is only a little
 more than a mile in length and roughly half that in width, cloaking the
 slopes of the oval hill crowned by the keep. It is a crowded place of 
cobbled streets, no trees, and tall, narrow, steep-roofed shops with 
rental living-quarters rising four floors or more above the selling 
floors. Cellars below house "candle-shops" -- small chambers where 
skilled workers repair or alter shoes, garments, or small items by 
candlelight. New wares are never sold in candleshops.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are only two open spaces within the town walls -- 
the Broad and the Bawling Market. The Broad, used for parking 
caravan-wagons and assembling their harness-teams, lies between the 
outer and inner town walls on the town's southeastern edge. The Market 
is the always-bustling local meeting place, a ragged oval perhaps a 
quarter of a mile long, bounded on the west by the frowning keep walls 
and on the east by the Church of All Souls, a temple of six sanctuaries 
open to all faiths (Chauntea, Lathander, Tempus, and Tymora 
predominate).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lodgings in Emrys tend to be noisy, cramped, and 
expensive. Stabling and even hitching fees are higher than 
accommodation, so many caravan merchants pay four to six silvers a wagon
 to camp in one of the nearby fields. From these, they trudge into town 
through one of three gates -- the Vigilant Gate (on the south), Vale 
Gate (northeast), and Sundown Gate (west). A fourth gate, Sunshadow (on 
the southeast), was blocked up after folk took to arriving and departing
 from the Broad without stopping for inspection and taxation by the 
Eagles of Emrys. These town guards collect levies of one silver piece 
per handcart or 'man-drag' litter, two silvers per palanquin or 
two-wheeled cart, and three silvers per wagon. Many visiting merchants 
still defiantly consider the Broad to be a "free merchant stand" 
territory where town laws can be ignored, but the Eagles (and their 
masters) disagree.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Emrystarl's Keep is an ancient, human-built fortress 
from the times of Glendarl, a sorcerous realm that preceded the yuan-ti 
rule of Sselempurrt, the dwarven and human trading post of Brokaun, and,
 most recently, the human land of Thuntar (now flourishing far to the 
west, halfway across the Border Kingdoms).</p>
<p align="LEFT">No one alive remembers who Emrystarl was, though folk 
share a vague impression of a mighty warrior who died in his keep old, 
well-respected, and undefeated -- leaving behind, of course, a treasure 
hoard that no one's ever found (yet). Tales are told of the old lord's 
phantom walking in the secret passages that honeycomb the keep walls 
("By the Old Lord's Ghost" is a local oath), but greed-besotted 
adventurers are warned that (to the best of anyone's knowledge) every 
'secret' passage in the keep has been found and thoroughly explored. A 
silent apparition of a helmed, fully-armored warrior has been seen from 
time to time stalking the passages, and legends tell of its chilling, 
insistent touch awakening certain young men and maids and leading them 
to weapons, maps, or missions that need doing. Most Emryans, however, 
scoff at the notion that Emrystarl still walks among them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Emrys is ruled by a council of six hereditary Grand 
Merchant Dukes and a citizen-elected Imperial Overduke. These counselors
 consider themselves the equals of the rulers of any great realm.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A flogging in the keep's cellar awaits any visitor who 
belittles the power or status of these seven rulers. They swagger about 
Emrys or the Vale within sight of the town daily (cynical Taldans say 
this is because their real power only extends as far as they can see 
from inside the town, and they know it). The Dukes want no one but 
themselves to have importance or influence in Emrys, so resident 
adventurers and prominent merchants are few. Emryan wizards and priests 
of any standing are unknown. In the daylit hours, there's always at 
least one Duke (or his personal equerry) on careful watch in the Broad 
for challenges to the dignity or authority of the Dukes or the law of 
Emrys.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Severe affronts against these sacred matters earn 
miscreants a body-brand in the shape of the symbol of the Emryan Dukes 
(a large gold coin surrounded by a circle of six smaller silver ones) 
and banishment from the town by being "flogged down the streets without 
delay." The goods and property of such offenders are forfeit to the 
'Ducal Hand.' (In other words, the Dukes take it as their own and fight 
over the division behind closed doors.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Dukes long ago seized the best houses in town for 
their use. As real estate is in very short supply in Emrys, and 
therefore overpriced, the ability to hand out residences gives the Dukes
 real power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Dukes, however, have arrived at some painfully blunt
 understandings with other powerful merchant families in town concerning
 the inadvisability of future seizures of properties belonging to said 
families. These days, the Dukes seldom move personally into any 
newly-seized building.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Only recently, an exile who was forced out one gate 
doubled back into the city by another gate right after his flogging and 
poisoned all the bottles in the extensive cellars under what had been, 
until minutes before, his house. The poisoning caused terrific carnage 
among the ducal families and their allies and favorites. The incidence 
of simpler traps built into residences (such as heavy furniture that 
crashes down to crush anyone sitting in the high seat at table or using 
the high-poster master bed) has well-nigh evaporated any enthusiasm on 
the part of the more greedy Dukes for regular acquisitions and 
house-movings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The office of Imperial Overduke was charged with giving 
all Emryans a say in government in order to prevent the hereditary Grand
 Merchant Dukes from becoming decadent tyrants. In practice, the 
elevated commoners (who serve a seven-year term) are quickly corrupted 
by the supposedly subservient Dukes. Those who can't be corrupted are 
kept senseless with drugged wine and then poisoned, if they prove 
particularly stubborn, principled, or power-hungry.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The current Overduke, Shryntuth Hammado, is a 
pleasure-loving former leatherworker who seems lost in the delights and 
privileges of rule (in his case, these amount to wild, wine-soaked 
parties in particular).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The six families who supply Emrys with its hereditary 
Dukes (and true rulers of the town) are the houses of Bulisstan, 
Dlanivaer, Klornu, Lylitrath, Orglast, and Relantovir.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Grand Merchant Dukes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The current Dukes are --</p>
<ul>
<li>Thalard Bulisstan (NE male Tethyrian human Ftr3; Str 17, Con 17), a 
grossly fat, malicious glutton who was -- several lifetimes ago, it 
seems -- a warrior of minor skills.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Melutho Dlanivaer (CE male Illuskan human Ftr9; Dex 17, Int 17), a 
dangerous fop who is a skilled actor (especially where deception is 
concerned) and who misses no detail. He also considers himself the 
greatest swordsman south of the Flaming Fist's hold and uses poisoned 
blades and skilled bodyguards to support this fancy. He's always on the 
watch for traitors and outlanders in town who may intend a threat to the
 rule of the Dukes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anather Klornu (NE male Tashalan human Clr 10 [Shar]; Int 18, Wis 
18), an effeminate, fat, brilliant priest of Shar who holds rites in a 
cellar at the bottom of Black Pillar Stair. (The pillar stands at the 
midpoint of the northern edge of the Market, holding up a bridge that 
crosses over Polduk Alley between two shops. The stair opens up against 
its northern face.) Klornu schemes tirelessly and subtly (so nothing 
will be traceable back to him) to eliminate the other Dukes and make 
Emrys a holy city of Shar-worshippers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Irten Lylitrath (LN male Illuskan human Ftr1), a shy, nondescript 
man with a keen eye, sharp ear, and brilliant memory -- and not much 
else. He gains self-confidence by following and slavishly obeying 
Melutho Dlanivaer. He is the least informed, least cruel, and fairest of
 the Dukes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Balos Orglast (CE male Calishite human Ftr7; Str 17, Dex 17), a 
coarse giant of a man who gets pleasure from hurting others -- people, 
beasts, hunted animals, horses he rides, and anything else within reach 
that isn't another Duke. He loves brawls and any chance for "some fun." 
As a result, he is the most hated and feared Duke among average Emryans.
 Orglast is an expert in the use of drovers' whips, flails, and hurled 
chairs and bottles -- empty or full.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sargar Relantovir (NE male Tethyrian human Wiz9/Ftr6; Str 16, Dex 
17, Int 18], a bearded, elegant, and close-mouthed giant of a man who 
enjoys acting mysteriously and manipulating folk into furthering his 
plans and desires. He's Melutho's only open rival at deadliness, 
wariness, intrigue, and foresight among the Grand Merchant Dukes (none 
of the Dukes is fully aware of Klornu's capabilities and treacheries). 
Relantovir poses as a fighting man who fears magic, but is in truth a 
closet mage. He seizes as many spells and magic items as he can from any
 wizards who come to town who are foolish enough to eat or drink within 
reach of his sleep-causing draughts (slumbers he ensures they never 
awaken from). Relantovir always has magic items on his person to deflect
 any attack from Melutho, other Dukes, or their agents, and has on 
occasion been forced to use them. Otherwise, he keeps his mastery of 
magic as secret as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Those Who Defy The Dukes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b></b>Despite all the local tales about the corruption,
 cruelty, and underhandedness of their rulers, most Emryans support the 
Dukes, crediting their energetic aggressiveness for giving Emrys a 
(little) international importance, and therefore trading prosperity. 
Other citizens keep their hatreds of the ducal rule well-hidden and obey
 the Dukes out of simple fear. </p>
<p align="LEFT">There are a few defiant exceptions, such as the Masked 
Ladies of the Bronzen Buckler and Butterfly dance and gambling club 
(whom the Dukes have been told to leave alone or face a general revolt 
of town merchants, and so content themselves with inspecting the club 
often and taxing it heavily). </p>
<p align="LEFT">A second is an underground group styling itself "the 
Riders of the Cracked Cauldron," alluding to the steaming cauldron badge
 of the onetime ruler of Emrys, the fat, jovial, High Councilor 'Mother'
 Laddath Hambreth (who died in a Vale hovel after being exiled by the 
first Merchant Dukes some three hundred winters ago). The Riders play 
pranks on the Dukes and occasionally threaten something more dangerous. 
Once, the portcullis of the Vale Gate fell on a horse and knight of the 
Ducal Bodyguard a bare armlength ahead of two mounted Dukes. Another 
time, a fire started in the Overduke's feasting hall, and fleeing guests
 discovered that a wagon just confiscated from a banished merchant was 
wedged into a bend in the stairs, blocking that way out. Certain 
visiting merchants covertly support the efforts of the Riders with hope 
of doing away with the present system of governance in Emrys.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are also tales of a masked bandit, Creeping 
Caladyn, who uses a bit of magic and an unmatched knowledge of the 
secret passages that "everyone knows" link many cellars and shops in 
hidden ways all over (or rather under) the town. This shadowy figure 
steals from the Dukes as ruthlessly and as often as they take from 
everyone else.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Emryan Attractions and Perils</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Why travel to Emrys at all? It's a prosperous place 
where people are always eager to buy. The shops in town are judged by 
most travelers to be unusually well-stocked for so small a center, and 
to charge reasonable, though not bargain basement, rates. Like the folk 
who run them, few are superb or particularly memorable. This allows the 
wares of a good traveling merchant to shine, and business is usually 
brisk.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The exceptions to the mediocrity of local establishments are the <i>Old Barrel Run</i>
 tavern (Fair/Cheap), a dark cellar where locals like to drown their 
troubles in strong tankards of local brew,and visitors come in search of
 low-priced ale and relative anonymity when negotiating deals; and the 
aforementioned <i>Bronzen Buckler and Butterfly</i> dance and gambling 
club (popular neither for dancing nor gaming, but rather for the company
 of the Masked Ladies, who, as one outlander merchant put it, "make up 
for shortfalls in ambience with enthusiasm and a lively sense of fun"). 
The hushed, isolated stone cellars that make up the private chambers of 
the Old Butterfly are the best of the very few places in Emrys where 
business can be discussed in complete privacy. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Nevertheless, patrons of the Butterfly are warned that 
the Dukes and their agents visit the place often, hoping to overhear 
things of interest. Delicate negotiations are best conducted at the back
 of a chamber with a Masked Lady singing a soft ballad between you and 
the firmly closed door.</p>
<p align="LEFT">From time to time, an exasperated visiting merchant or 
Taldan farmer from the outlying Vale growls that "the Dukes must go!" No
 one has yet mustered the necessary force. Would-be conquerors are 
warned that the Dukes are known to have effective spying and slaying 
magic items, and they have used them swiftly and mercilessly to quell 
two revolts and at least four external takeover attempts (that the town 
in general knows about).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Dukes also have their private, personal bodyguards. 
Most of them are never without at least a dozen ready-for-battle 
fighters and thieves. Add to these their family retainers, house guards,
 and the Eagles to call upon whenever trouble erupts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The town guard consists of hired, fairly competent 
outlander adventurers under the command of officers drawn from the 
families of the Grand Merchant Dukes. Their ranks, which are riddled 
with spies for the Dukes, are also in a constant state of rivalry and 
intrigue engineered by the Dukes to keep the troops from becoming bored 
or uniting to overthrow the ducal rule. The Eagles patrol throughout 
Talduth Vale under orders to slay or drive out suspected wizards and 
priests of more than 4th level or so, wherefore no such persons are 
known to be resident in Emrys.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are, however, persistent rumors that a mighty 
archmage dwells in hiding in Emrys, using the unwitting Dukes as a front
 to keep order in the town around his hideaway. According to these 
tales, he occasionally hurls world-rending magics at any wizard brash 
(and capable) enough to seriously challenge the Dukes. There have been 
confrontations between Dukes or their agents and traveling mages over 
the years, and the mages have mysteriously disappeared or moved on 
without the mayhem and carnage one might expect to befall. The ranks of 
the vanished are even said to include Zhentarim magelings and Red 
Wizards. Are they the origin of the phantom apparitions of floating, 
flying human skulls seen flitting above the Emrysar Bog some nights?</p>
<p align="LEFT">The mysteries at the heart of Emrys remain to be 
unraveled. What would seem to be a simple thing for wayfaring heroes to 
untangle persists from year to year.</p>
