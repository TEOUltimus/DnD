In <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/953797200"><i>Dragons of Faerun</i></a>
 this book, Dungeon Masters are given information on specific dragons of
 Faerûn and how they may interact with or fight against the players. 
Avid readers of our website will note that some of the dragons from the 
Wyrms of the North series written by Ed Greenwood and updated by Eric L.
 Boyd and Sean K Reynolds are mentioned or further updated in this book.
 Dungeon Masters also receive information on organizations that players 
can belong to or work against, like the evil Cult of the Dragon. Also 
included is information on how to run a campaign that features the Year 
of Rogue Dragons, the one time every thousand years the dragons of 
Faerûn rampage across the continent. The excerpts below include short 
history of dragonkind in the setting, the dragon Tchazzar, a few lair 
hazards, and two magic items. </p>

<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Time of Dragons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the wake of the Days of Thunder, dragons rose to rule
 Faerûn. Elven myth, recorded in the form of the Parwiccan Cycle, speaks
 of the Tearfall, thought to refer to a rain of meteors that fell from 
the sky. Some scholars interpret the ancient texts as suggesting the 
meteors precipitated a dramatic climatic change, which in turn sparked 
the rapid evolution of proto-dragons (little more than large lizards) 
into the varied forms of dragonkind known today. Others claim that the 
meteors were in fact falling dragon eggs, from which the varied races of
 dragonkind were born into this world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Time of Dragons, also known as the Dawn Ages, began 
circa -30,000 DR and lasted some six millennia. Individual dragons and 
dragon clans ruled large swaths of territory and battled with their 
rivals for control of the land, seas, and skies. The dragons of this age
 were devout followers of the draconic pantheon, and many wars of this 
period were fought over religious issues. Over time, however, religious 
fervor waned, as philosophers of different faiths came to the conclusion
 that the draconic deities were not the guardians and protectors of 
dragonkind, because they had allowed dragons to fight such genocidal 
conflicts in their name. The one draconic holy war that continued 
unabated was the Dragonfall War[RD], which pitted the followers of 
Bahamut against the spawn of Tiamat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">During this period of devastating warfare among the 
dragons of Faerûn, isolated pockets of formerly dragon-ruled territory 
fell under giant control. Over time, such giant-ruled kingdoms came to 
threaten the hegemony of dragonkind, leading to great battles between 
giant-ruled kingdoms such as Darchar, Grunfesting, Helligheim, Nedeheim,
 Ostoria, and Rangfjell, and dragon-ruled realms such as Caesinmalsvir, 
Darastriverthicha, and Tharkrixghontix. While Faerûn's dragons and 
giants battled for dominance of Toril, the smaller humanoid races began 
to carve out their own kingdoms. In one such instance, the Parwiccan 
Cycle speaks of the descendants of Tintageer, now known as moon and gold
 elves, who carved a realm from the northlands of Faerûn by defeating a 
red great wyrm named Mahatnartorian, Master of the Mountains.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Time of Dragons drew to an end with the dawning of 
the Rage of Dragons. The High Mages of the Fair Folk hit upon a plan 
that involved the creation of a high magic effect tied to appearances of
 the King-Killer Star (also known as the Kingslayer Star among the Fair 
Folk) in the heavens. In an ancient citadel in the northernmost reaches 
of Faerûn, they created the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>, encompassing all 
Faerûn and periodically driving Faerûn's wyrms to madness. The 
King-Killer Star appeared in the heavens just often enough for the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>
 to disrupt the dominance of the dragon race over the continent, but not
 so often as to prevent the rise of humanoid kingdoms in the inter-Rage 
periods.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Under the King-Killer Star</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the twenty-five millennia that followed, the 
collective power of Faerûn's wyrms waxed and waned, but dragonkind never
 reclaimed its absolute rule over Faerûn. Every time individual wyrms or
 dragon clans sought to reestablish their dominance over large swaths of
 Faerûn, either the lesser humanoid races united to bring them down (see
 the Dragonmoots sidebar) or, failing that, the King-Killer Star 
returned to drive them into madness, destroy what they had wrought, and 
turn them against their own offspring. Only once did an allied group of 
dragons come close to unraveling the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>, but the 
long-forgotten wyrms of that day were turned aside by the sacrifice of 
nearly the entire subrace of avariels, who mustered a great crusade to 
fly north and defend the ancient citadel that housed the <i>Dracorage mythal</i> capstone.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Although exceptions are recorded throughout history, in 
time the majority of Faerûn's dragons came to occupy the niche of top 
predator, not king. Notable exceptions include Anaglathos, who ruled 
over Turmish for six years; Kisonraathiisar, who ruled over Westgate 
until the Year of Bold Poachers (-349 DR); Tchazzar, who ruled over 
Chessenta for nearly a century (and has now returned); and 
Ylveraasahlisar the Rose Dragon, who ruled over Calimport for a century.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The last Rage of Dragons unleashed by the King-Killer 
Star unfolded in the Year of the Dracorage (1018 DR). The last Flight of
 Dragons occurred over the Dalelands and the Moonsea in the Year of the 
Worm (1356 DR).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dragonfall War</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Although the Time of Dragons is long forgotten, even 
among the most ancient of great wyrms, the ancient conflict between 
Tiamat and Bahamut has continued, increasing and decreasing in intensity
 over time, gradually subsuming other races and cultures as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The last great era of conflict between the Platinum 
Dragon and the Chromatic Dragon raged from -2087 DR to -1071 DR, during 
the first millennium of the Untheric empire. Tiamat's cult was brought 
to Faerûn (at least among humans) by the Mulan. The clergy of Enlil 
preached that Tiamat was the Nemesis of the Gods, and she was blamed by 
the god-kings for every setback Unther experienced as it rose to 
greatness and then decayed over the centuries. Tiamat battled an 
Untheric alias of Bahamut, known as Marduk the Justice Bringer, time and
 again, but neither wyrm could prevail.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In -1,071 DR, the Untheric pantheon marched to war 
against the deities of the orc pantheon in a cataclysmic conflict that 
saw the death of many gods. During the final Battle of the Gods, Tiamat 
launched a surprise attack against Gilgeam while he battled Ilneval. The
 ever-vigilant Marduk intervened, killing Tiamat before she could land a
 death blow against Gilgeam, but at the cost of his own life.</p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="center"><b>Dragonmoots</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The proud but now-vanishing tradition of Dragonmoots is 
much sung of when dwarves empty tankards. Of old, Dragonmoots were 
"called" (by messenger-dwarves sent from one dwarf clan to another) 
whenever the leader of a dwarf clan decided that a particular dragon was
 too bothersome to be left alone any longer and too powerful for a clan 
to risk tackling alone.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most Dragonmoots involved two or three dwarf clans, the 
elders of all meeting to decide just how a specific dragon would be 
fought, and how its hoard would be divided after victory (and such 
forays almost always ended in victory). Adventurers from the ranks of 
the clan would be asked to lead the attack, bolstered by the axes of old
 dwarves desiring to die in battle and the frightened strength of 
younglings wanting to prove themselves worthy, in the eyes of their 
clan, of becoming warriors.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Clan elders encouraged Dragonmoots as occasions when 
dwarf clans would meet, feast together, discuss trade, cast eyes on 
eligible dwarves of other clans, and "take measure" of each other 
(marking the likenesses and characters of important dwarves for future 
diplomatic use). It took as many as seven clans to defeat some wyrms, 
and more than one dragon ravaged those sent against it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Dragonmoots began to fade when dwarves grew too few to 
dare openly challenge dragons (except as members of "crazed adventuring 
bands"), and certain clan elders grew too suspicious of other dwarves, 
and of the risks of gathering anywhere, to enthusiastically support 
future moots. However, several clans revived the old practice during the
 recent Rage of Dragons, since the Thunder Blessing has increased the 
ranks of their warriors.</p>

<p align="LEFT">In the wake of the Battle of the Gods, the Platinum 
Dragon was reduced to the rank of celestial paragon[BoED] (with divine 
rank 1 if celestial paragons are considered demigods in your campaign), 
and the Chromatic Dragon was reduced to the rank of archfiend[BoVD] 
(with divine rank 1 if archfiends are considered demigods in your 
campaign). Marduk's church vanished entirely, his name remembered only 
as one of the Old Ones of Unther, but Tiamat's cult survived after a 
fashion. As Gilgeam grew increasingly tyrannical, the people of Unther 
never forgot the Nemesis of the Gods and they increasingly turned to her
 in secret for succor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Followers of the Scaly Way</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of Fell Pearls (887 DR), a former Chosen of 
Mystra named Sammaster became convinced that dead dragons would one day 
rule Toril, a path he named the Scaly Way. Sammaster created his first 
dracolich in the Year of Queen's Tears (902 DR), and the ranks of the 
Cult of the Dragon soon swelled. In the years that followed, Sammaster 
suffered a series of setbacks, but the Cult of the Dragon continued to 
follow his teachings. (Further details on the history of the Cult of the
 Dragon can be found in Chapter 3.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">After his last defeat in the Year of the Blacksnake 
(1285 DR), the lich Sammaster returned to unlife once again thanks to 
the magic of his phylactery. Once he did, however, Sammaster saw little 
point in resuming command of the Followers of the Scaly Way immediately,
 for he had tried that path before. The founder of the Cult of the 
Dragon was frustrated by the inability of the secret society, strong in 
magic but numerically weak, to stand against its foes, and by the 
reluctance of many evil dragons to embrace his vision of a future when 
they, as undead dracoliches, would rule supreme. Plainly, he needed a 
new strategy, and he sought inspiration in ancient texts and places of 
power.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Return of the Dragon Queen</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of the Bloodbird (1346 DR), after centuries 
of silence from the Dragon Queen, the few remaining followers of the 
Nemesis of the Gods successfully summoned an aspect of Tiamat known as 
the Dark Lady to Unther, an event that had been heralded centuries 
before by Ochir Naal, prophet of Tiamat. Over the next dozen years, the 
Dark Lady secretly fomented rebellion throughout Unther, seeking to 
overthrow the hated Gilgeam, and the ranks of her followers swelled once
 again (elevating her to the rank of demigod).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unknown to her followers in Unther, the Dragon Queen had
 her own reasons for finally answering their prayers. While the Church 
of Tiamat grew in opposition to the despotic rule of Gilgeam, the Dragon
 Queen turned her baleful gaze to Sammaster's studies, in which she saw 
suggestions of mad genius. Through subtle hints and divinely inspired 
bursts of intuition, Tiamat helped Sammaster rediscover the secrets of 
the <i>Dracorage mythal</i> without revealing to him that his 
discoveries were shaped by the claws of a dark god. In time, roaming the
 Moonsea region and the Cold Lands in disguise, Sammaster discovered the
 existence of the <i>Dracorage mythal</i> and its secrets. As Tiamat had hoped, he set about harnessing the power of the Dracorage for his own ends.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Time of Troubles</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of Shadows (1358 DR), the Avatar Crisis 
forced the gods of Toril to walk among their followers in mortal form, 
upsetting many divine machinations, including those of the Dragon Queen.
 During the Time of Troubles, Gilgeam destroyed Tiamat, seemingly ending
 her threat to his eternal rule. In truth, however, Tiamat's essence was
 splintered among three powerful dragons in the region. The largest of 
the three, Tchazzar, consumed the other two, therefore meeting the 
conditions the Dragon Queen had laid down in advance. Tchazzar was 
thereby transformed into Tiamat anew.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Fall of the Gods also returned Bahamut to the land 
in avatar form for the first time since the death of Marduk. During his 
sojourn on Faerûn, the Platinum Dragon caught wind of Tiamat's brewing 
plots, which presaged a resumption of the Dragonfall War.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rise of the Dragon King</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of Serpent (1359 DR), Gareth Dragonsbane, 
future king of Damara, and his adventuring companions returned from an 
expedition to the Abyss, having stolen the <i>Wand of Orcus, </i>shattered
 it in the blood of an avatar of Tiamat (checking her plans once again),
 and returned to Damara with the blessing of Bahamut. Gareth brought 
with him the Tree-Gem, which, once planted, represented Bahamut's 
covenant to protect Damara against the influence of demons as long as 
the kingdom of Damara allied itself with the forces of good. In so 
doing, Gareth brought to Damara a measure of peace and freedom from 
demonic meddling that the rest of the Demonlands has never experienced.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As Bahamut had hoped, the planting of the Tree-Gem 
sparked renewed interest in his teachings among the nondragon races. In 
the years that followed, good-aligned mortals across Faerûn heard the 
Call of Bahamut, and many pledged themselves to the service of the 
Platinum Dragon. The elite became platinum knights[Dra] or vassals of 
Bahamut[BoED]. Some of those who were called by Bahamut chose to undergo
 the Rite of Rebirth, transforming themselves into a long-forgotten race
 known as the dragonborn[RD]. As the ranks of his followers swelled, 
Bahamut rose in power, assuming the rank of lesser deity once again, 
while Tiamat did the same.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The planting of Bahamut's Tree-Gem also drew the 
attention of the Dragon Queen. In response, Tiamat dispatched an avatar 
to Castle Perilous in the cold wastelands of Vaasa. Scores of chromatic 
dragons heeded her call and descended on the ruined fortress. With their
 participation, the Dragon Queen initiated a massive breeding program, 
creating all manner of spawn of Tiama, horrifying monstrosities that had
 not been seen in Toril since the Battle of the Gods. The spawn of 
Tiamat then spread far and wide. (Several varieties of spawn of Tiamat 
are presented in <i>Monster Manual IV</i>. Two new ones -- the bluespwan stoneglider and the redspawn birther -- are in this book.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Year of Rogue Dragons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of Rogue Dragons (1373 DR), Sammaster finally completed his transformation of the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>, tying his phylactery to the chamber that served as the capstone of the ancient <i>Dracorage mythal</i>
 so that the mythal's effects were no longer constrained by the 
appearance of the King-Killer Star in the heavens, but linked instead to
 his own life force. Only dracoliches would remain unaffected by 
Sammaster's endless, ever-intensifying Dracorage, and wyrms of every 
species would have to ally themselves with the Cult and accept 
transformation into the form of a Sacred One, or suffer permanent 
madness. The lich then set about reasserting his control over individual
 Cult of the Dragon cells across Faerûn. From the isle of Tan in the 
Pirate Isles to Dragonback Mountain, northernmost peak of the Riders to 
the Sky mountains, Cult members transformed their secret strongholds 
into laboratories in which dozens if not hundreds of dragons could be 
transformed into dracoliches in a short period of time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As the Rage of Dragons spread and worsened, chromatic 
dragons across Faerûn either succumbed to its effects and turned on 
whoever crossed their path or desperately embraced the Dragon Cult as an
 alternative. Rampaging wyrms wreaked great destruction across Faerûn, 
from As'arem to Calimport and from Asavir's Channel to the Tannath 
Mountains, but Sammaster's guiding hand focused their destruction on 
Damara, Impiltur, Narfell, Sossal, Vaasa, and the Cold Lands north of 
the Moonsea. Communities such as Bloodstone Pass, the Monastery of the 
Yellow Rose, Uluvin, and Ylraphon were destroyed or nearly so by dragons
 who succumbed to madness, and other groups, such as the Thousand Fists 
orc tribe of the Nether Mountains and the navies of Cimbar and Soorenar,
 were decimated by the dragons' wrath.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lareth, sovereign of the gold dragons, called for a 
great council in the Galena Mountains, where he unveiled his plan for 
all the metallic dragons to enter a magical slumber until the Dracorage 
subsided, as his kind had done time and again. (While many elder 
metallic dragons had the magical ability to flee to another plane, due 
to long-standing draconic traditions regarding territorial claims, they 
did not do so, fearing the effect of "abandoning" territory on the 
Material Plane to their hated chromatic cousins.) Although many wyrms 
agreed with the King of Justice, a few rebels rejected this approach, 
maintaining (thanks to subtle hints from the Lord of the North Wind) 
that this episode of Dracorage was like no other and would last forever.
 Displaying the first tinges of madness, Lareth threatened to use his 
minions to coerce or destroy any dragon who resisted. In time, the great
 gold wyrm Tamarand, second only to Lareth, was forced to destroy the 
King of Justice, but he refused the mantle of royalty.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Only the gem dragons largely escaped the effects of the 
Dracorage, for they had the power (and the willingness) to flee to the 
Inner Planes for however long it lasted. However, a few waited too long 
and succumbed to the effects of the Dracorage as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As Sammaster's plot unfolded with astonishing swiftness,
 a group of heroes led by Dorn Graybrook (CN male half-iron golemMM2 
[augmented Vaasan human] fighter 10/ranger 3) and Karasendrieth (CG 
female adult song dragon sorcerer 3/bard 2) worked to unravel the 
effects of Sammaster's Art. In locales such as the Gray Forest, the 
Monastery of the Yellow Rose, Northkeep, and Thar, the heroes retraced 
Sammaster's path, seeking the lore first found by the lich that allowed 
him to manipulate the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eventually, the allies discovered how to counter the <i>Dracorage mythal</i> (using the spell <i>abate Dracorage</i>*) and turned their efforts toward finding the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>'s
 capstone. Their search led them to a lost elf city in the Novularond 
Mountains in the heart of the Great Glacier and from there, through a <i>portal</i>,
 to the ancient citadel in the northernmost reaches of Faerûn in which 
the mythal had been raised millennia ago. After a great battle with 
Sammaster and his summoned planar dragon allies, the heroes prevailed, 
destroying the lich, his phylactery, and the <i>Dracorage mythal</i> once and for all, thereby forever ending the magical madness that had long afflicted the dragons of Faerûn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Turning of the Great Cycle</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the wake of Sammaster's Rage of Dragons, Faerûn's 
wyrms returned to their lairs, greatly reduced in number. Many had died 
unleashing orgies of destruction on the lesser races of Faerûn. Others 
had embraced dracolichdom, and some now found themselves magically 
beholden to the Dragon Cult's Wearers of Purple. Few among the 
dragonkind races realized that Tiamat had set in motion the events that 
led to the destruction of the <i>Dracorage mythal</i>, but word quickly 
spread that Sammaster and the Cult were behind the most recent rage 
(thanks to skilled rumormongering by both the Harpers and the Church of 
Tiamat). Even fewer realized the end of the Dracorage marked the Turning
 of the Great Cycle, the long-foretold resumption of religious fervor 
among dragonkind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of Lightning Storms (1374 DR) Faerûn was 
beset by great lightning strikes the length and breadth of the 
continent. At least some of those lightning strikes marked the impact 
points of an unusual year-long rain of meteors. In a series of visions, 
Bahamut and Tiamat instructed their respective followers to seek out 
such sites, for each contained some form of draconic egg within. In the 
months that followed, the Church of Tiamat recovered more than half of 
the eggs of the latest Tearfall and brought them back to the Altar of 
Scales in Unthalass in preparation for the looming war. The rest were 
lost, hatched on their own, or recovered by followers of Bahamut.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now, with Faerûn still reeling from the aftereffects of 
Sammaster's rage, the Dragonfall War threatens to erupt anew, pitting 
the followers of Bahamut and Tiamat against each other in an ancient 
holy war last fought centuries ago, while the Church of Tiamat and the 
Wearers of Purple struggle for control of Sammaster's legacy.</p>
