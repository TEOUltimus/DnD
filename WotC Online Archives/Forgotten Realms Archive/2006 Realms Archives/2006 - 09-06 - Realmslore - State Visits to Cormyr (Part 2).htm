<p align="LEFT"><b>"Take a deep breath, grasp your temper firmly in both hands, and <i>read</i>,"
 Filfaeril said sunnily. "And try to understand and remember it, too, 
because I'll be asking you a question or two about it, later in the 
day."</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>"Fee," Azoun asked plaintively, "why are you <i>doing</i> this? Can't I just . . ."</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>"Go kill something? Wring my neck? Father another --"</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>"Very good, very good, very <i>good!</i>" the King of
 all Cormyr said hastily, almost snatching the parchment from under 
Filfaeril's sweet smile. "Slaver," he added, under his breath.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>"Barbarian," she responded fondly, kissing him.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The document resumes:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>2. Proclamation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">No action on our part but to forward reports of performance to Master of the Rolls.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heralds formally inform local lords of the relevant itinerary items 
of the visit, and then post public proclamations of same(1) and "utter" 
(make public announcements, following a text prepared at the palace with
 an eye for how much the Crown wants the citizenry to know and how much 
the guest wants to meet with deputations, malcontents, former 
countrymen, trade envoys, and the like). </li>
<li>Posting can be delegated to Purple Dragons or local court officers, but utterance cannot.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Hereafter events vary from visit to visit according to 
the specifics of the itinerary, but a typical roster appears here, 
numbered continuously with the preceding steps so as to communicate the 
usual sequence of happenings. Inquiries to the Clerk of Protocol and 
Court Heralds as to the arrangement of all of the following steps in a 
given visit should ensure that major diplomatic disasters are avoided.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>3. Arrival</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This will always involve a ceremony, either on the docks
 or at a suitable square or waymoot, with fanfares and/or speeches of 
welcome.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thereafter will follow a parade and/or escorted procession (parade and/or escorted conveyance to a royal residence).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The amount of pomp and ceremony varies with the 
visitor's wishes, security concerns, place of arrival (grand procession 
from the docks of Suzail, yes -- grand procession from the docks to the 
waiting citadel in the naval base at Marsember, no -- accompinent by 
honor guard, probably yes).</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Master of Revels </i>and <i>Court Heralds</i> handle details of ceremony.</li>
<li><i>Master of the Horse</i> provides covered coaches (open coaches 
only if security and weather permit, if only weather is a concern, 
closed coaches must still be ready nearby in case it turns inclement).</li>
<li><i>Court War Wizard</i> sees to protective escort and shieldings.</li>
<li><i>Highknights</i> act as agents of the crown to determine exactly 
how many persons are in the outland party at this time and make sure 
they stay with the party. If anyone slips away, they are to be followed 
(with assistance of War Wizards).</li>
<li><i>Purple Dragons</i> form the uniformed escort and honor guard.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>4. Presentation to the Court</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The usually occurs on the same day as Arrival unless 
travel or health of visiting personages require otherwise. Presentation 
involves a full, formal court ceremony with speeches, possible exchange 
of gifts, and welcoming by The Crown.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Master of Revels </i>and <i>Court Heralds</i> see to details of 
the ceremony, obtaining approvals from The Crown or Regent, Royal 
Magician, Clerk of Protocol, Lord High Marshal or Acting Lord Protector 
of the Realm.</li>
<li><i>Clerk of Protocol</i> assembles list of select guests to receive invitations.</li>
<li><i>Royal Pages</i> deliver invitations.</li>
<li><i>Highknights</i> and <i>War Wizards </i>(as assigned by the Royal Magician) make security arrangements in consultation with the Lord High Marshal.</li>
<li><i>Stewards</i> see to deployment of Gentlemen Ushers and uniformed Purple Dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>5. State Feast </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The feast is usually held the evening of the same day as
 the Presentation. All preparations for the feast are the same as for 
the Presentation, with the addition of the Royal Kitchens and Servers, 
who must adhere to the itinerary.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>6. Protocol Meeting </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b></b>Usually occurs the during the night or early 
morning immediately following the State Feast. The ame court officers 
are involved as in the Presentation, hosting (in private) outland envoys
 of the visiting personage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Itinerary must be confirmed and approvals obtained for all changes.</li>
<li>Highknights and War Wizards are tasked with listening in on this 
discussion from absolute concealment, under the protocol of extreme 
discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>7. Royal Audience </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The audience is usually held after highsunfeast on the 
day following the State Feast. The audience is a relaxed, private 
discussion between The Crown or Regent and visiting personages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Servants and attendants must be present as determined by the itinerary and as modified in the Protocol Meeting.</li>
<li>Those same court officers indicated for Presentation conduct the 
same functions. Invitations should be limited to essential nobles and 
functionaries.</li>
<li>Royal Magician determines whether Highknights and War Wizards must 
listen in from concealment, under protocol of extreme discretion(2). His
 decision is communicated after the fact to the Master of Rolls, the 
Royal Sage, and The Crown, but is not shared with any of us.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>8. Reception</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The evening revel should occur the same day as the Royal
 Audience when possible, with private in-chamber dining, rest, and 
bathing for visiting personage between if necessary. Only a select list 
of guests is invited.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Reception consists of drinks, conversation afoot, and 
light entertainment (minstrelry in gallery) with the aim of encouraging 
friendly mingling between visitors and the court. </p>
<ul>
<li>The royal family may appear separately in casual dress, not regalia, so full security is required.</li>
<li>All preparations and court officers involved in the State Feast perform identical functions here.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Filfaeril's arm is sure to be removed from around 
Azoun's neck momentarily, so let's see what they discover about this 
mysterious, secret passage in our next installment.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">1. The Master of the Rolls is the archivist of the Royal
 Court (a role performed in the Palace by the Scribes Royal). For an 
example of such a proclamation, see the opening scene of the short story
 "The Long Road Home" in <i>The Best of the Realms Book II: The Stories of Ed Greenwood</i>, published by Wizards of the Coast in 2005.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Those unfamiliar with Cormyr are advised that the Royal 
Palace and the Royal Court are two different buildings in Suzail. The 
Palace stands in the Royal Gardens, north of the Court, with "Lake 
Azoun" between them. It sits "behind" the Royal Court, which largely 
hides it from public view. The Royal Court is a vast, sprawling series 
of connected buildings where most courtiers work and many live. It is 
all that most Cormyreans see of what's colloquially known as "the 
Court," meaning functions where well-dressed folk appear before or 
socially meet the monarch or court functionaries, or face justice.</p>
<p align="LEFT">2. "Protocol of extreme discretion" can be bluntly 
translated as "spying." This generally involves full concealment and 
several disguised watchers with backup and magical oversight from the 
War Wizard. The sites for functions requiring this protocol are chosen, 
whenever possible, from among those that have ready access via secret 
passages, spyholes, and the like.</p>
