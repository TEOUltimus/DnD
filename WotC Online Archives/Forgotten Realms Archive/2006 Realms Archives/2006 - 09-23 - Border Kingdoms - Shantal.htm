<p>Some folk call Shantal "the heart of the Border Kingdoms," not just 
because it's centrally located in the tamer, western half of the region,
 but because it's almost stereotypical of these realms -- it has bucolic
 beauty, eccentric rulership, and lurking danger. </p>
<p>The Grand Duchy today is a broad, tranquil-seeming valley of gently 
rolling farmland studded with woodlots, flanked to east and west by 
lightly wooded hills, and crisscrossed by winding lanes. At its center 
rise the triple-spired Duchal Towers, surrounded by a neat ring of 
cottages -- the village of Shantal. These in turn are encircled by a 
road, beyond which lie long, narrow vegetable gardens that end in 
orchards, one for each cottage, radiating outward like the spokes of a 
wagonwheel. </p>
<p><b>The Vigilant Bailiffs</b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2009-23%20-%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Shantal_files/dnd_frbk_20060923a_shantal.jpg" alt="Grand Duchy of Shantal" title="Grand Duchy of Shantal" align="right" border="0" height="227" width="325">It's
 a curiously neat and ordered settlement for the Border Kingdoms, and 
the impression of alert, tidy authority is further enhanced by the ever 
present Grand Patrols of Vigilant Bailiffs, dozen-strong mounted groups 
of capable-looking warriors who know the ground and work well together 
in chases, captures, and battle. The Bailiffs are War 4-7s who are all 
armed with crossbows, swords, javelins, and weighted throwing nets. They
 wear chainmail beneath black surcoats emblazoned with the badge of the 
duchy -- an emerald green Kaudraun (human left hand, palm toward viewer,
 shown from the wrist up; fingers spread and wavering into tongues of 
flame; thumb tapering into a zig-zag lightning bolt). </p>
<p>The Vigilant Bailiffs dominate the roads of the duchy. They are 
empowered to defend Shantal's peace with lethal force but are more 
sternly tolerant than ruthless or zealous. Bribery drives them to quiet 
fury, and they are never careless, bored, or inattentive. </p>
<p>Visiting mages are closely escorted by Bailiffs at all times while in
 the Duchy. The Bailiffs won't hesitate to summon reinforcements by horn
 (more Grand Patrols and certain monsters -- see below) if faced with 
magical or formidable foes such as adventurers of obvious battle skill. </p>
<p><b>Local Goods</b></p>
<p>Shantan farmers keep livestock, grow vegetables, and sell (to 
way-merchants and passing travelers) smoky-flavored, dark beer known as 
"Old Oakey" after the casks it's stored in (hand keg, 10 cp; cask, 4 sp;
 barrel, 1 gp; and butt, 3 gp; not shipped in tuns). They also deal in 
sausage, hams, and Shantan Slice, a sharp-flavored, red cheese that 
sells in 10-lb. wheels for 5 sp. Most Shantans sell from covered carts 
at their gates, or the traveler can stop at The Roping Post and choose 
from a wide selection of local produce. </p>
<p><b>What Greets Travelers In Shantal</b></p>
<p>Almost any visitor can't help but notice at least three things while 
in Shantal -- visiting mages are watched very closely at all times; 
there don't seem to be any priests or mages in evidence; and almost all 
of the villagers are well-armed and look like retired warriors. </p>
<p>In fact, they are retired (or semi-retired) warriors. Most Shantans 
are well-armed, former warriors who are glad to dwell in a place free of
 hostile magic and those who wield it. Most are self-sufficient farmers 
and craftworkers producing such things as helms, shields, and bracers of
 their own design ('Shantan-make' gear tends to be non-reflective, 
rust-resistant, and fitted with handy dagger sheaths and coin pouches). 
Most of these veterans also volunteer for occasional duty as Vigilant 
Bailiffs. </p>
<p>Visitors to Shantal will notice what seems to be a lack of any 
resident priests or mages. In fact, this is not the case. A handful of 
Tempuran priests who call themselves the Battleforges of Tempus dwell in
 the Duchal Towers. From there, they minister to the spiritual and 
healing needs of the Vigilant Bailiffs, the Grand Duke, and any visiting
 warriors who worship the Lord of Battles. They are allowed to function 
in this manner in return for their vow never to contest the Grand Duke's
 authority or that of his Bailiffs and never to attempt to reach the 
Daerndar (caverns under the Towers) or aid any mage who does so. </p>
<p>Amenities also seem scarce. There's only one well-stocked store -- 
The Roping Post, across the road from the main gates of the Duchal 
Towers. It's a cluttered barn of old and new hardware, ironmongery, and 
all manner of flashy peddlers' wares, as well as outright junk. The 
Roping Post is run by Analytha Kroanarl, a cheerful, talkative, bustling
 NG female Calishite human Exp1 who knows everyone in the valley and 
will discuss anything except two features of Shantal -- the Official 
Mage and the Daerndar. </p>
<p>Beside the Post stands Shantal's lone combined inn and tavern, the 
Grand Duke's Griffon (Good/Cheap), a typically dingy, old roadhouse run 
by four leathery-faced, aging sisters (Dratha, Amaela, Horlarra, and 
Bethra Tarmhand, all NG female Chondathan human Exp1s who are Harper 
friends and skilled horsebreeders). They have tthe assistance of two 
quick, quiet, always bustling gnome families, the Haerhogaunts and the 
Talthwishes. Gorth Talthwish sells a small but good array of 
long-lasting dyes for hair, skin, and clothing. These are packed in clay
 pots the size of his own head for 1 sp each. The Griffon was named for 
an irascible, long-dead, winged steed of the first Grand Duke. Visitors 
are warned not to step on, capture, or torment any of the pet toads that
 hop through the establishment -- they're apt to be mages transformed by
 Flyndara or the Daerndar and can be a mite irascible themselves. </p>
<p><b>The History of Shantal</b></p>
<p>The reasons for these three local peculiarities must be discovered by
 most visitors for themselves, because there is a curious silence around
 the Border realms as to the history of Shanta. Persistent investigators
 can discover the following facts. </p>
<p>The Grand Duchy was founded three generations ago by Pelindar 
Slendyn, the last surviving warrior-servant of the archmage known as the
 Arcanauh (after a duel that destroyed the Arcanauh, his Red Tower, and 
his onetime consort-turned-bitter-foe, the Thayan sorceress Ithcatra 
Llumen). Present-day Shantal stands on the site of the Red Tower, which 
was reduced to rubble in the battle. </p>
<p>Pelindar forbade the use of magic in Shantal, as did his son Thaerin,
 the second Grand Duke. Almost continuous incursions by Daerndar seekers
 made necessary the establishment of an Official Mage early in the reign
 of the current Grand Duke, Orsarr Slendyn. Orsarr is a bluff, burly, 
fun-loving man (NG male Tashalan human Ftr10) who but reluctantly 
retired from wenching his way through Sword Coast taverns upon the death
 of his father Thaerin. </p>
<p>Orsarr tried to persuade his adventuring companion -- the tall, 
battered, widowed, old sorceress Athamundra Rildar of Zazesspur (LN 
female Tethyrian human Wiz17) -- to come to Shantal and be his mage, but
 Athamundra was elderly, increasingly feeble, and reluctant to leave the
 cottage and friends she'd been longing to settle down with. She sent 
her daughter instead, the stunningly beautiful Flyndara Rildar (CN 
female Tethyrian human Wiz14/Sor6). Flyndara stands almost seven feet 
tall and sports flame-orange hair, sparkling green eyes, and a temper 
swifter and fiercer than most thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Flyndara Rildar gave the Grand Duke what he wanted -- her promise to 
defend the duchy from severe attacks, backed by wards to protect his 
lands (most sages believe she modified wards powered by a hidden 
artifac, created by the Arcanauh). She then spell-built herself the 
smallest, most northerly of the Duchal Towers and vanished inside to 
pursue her studies (she dropped vague hints about "spending time on 
other planes"). Shantans respect her order that she wasn't to be 
disturbed unless the safety of the Duchy was at stake. </p>
<p>Flyndara has been seen only rarely since. Typically, she strides 
unannounced into evening feasts, half-dressed and with tangled and 
matted hair, and falls on food like a starving prisoner, gorging herself
 until sated. She welcomes no visitors nor apprentices, and there's a 
widespread rumor among Shantans that she stalks the Grand Duke's lands 
in bird or beast shape, keeping watch for thieves and other miscreants. 
There's also talk that she indulges in cruel bloodlust by hunting and 
slaying the usual prey of whatever animal shape she's currently adopted.
 Even darker rumors hint that she's commanded the Grand Duke not to 
marry, because he will be her mate when she feels ready to bear a 
daughter to be her magical heir. </p>
<p>Whatever the truth about the Official Mage's sanity or marital 
intentions, it is certain that on three occasions she's blasted 
intruding mages to dust. These incidents eliminated at least twelve 
spellcasters, including a Red Wizard of Thay, a Halruaan archmage of 
senior years (and, presumably, accomplishments), and a Zhentarim of 
rising reputation and demonstrated battle skill. Common wisdom holds 
that Flyndara prevailed through a combination of reckless lack of 
dignity, strange spells acquired in distant lands and perhaps even 
worlds, and the use of multiple artifacts of power. Just what those 
artifacts might be is a topic much whispered about in the Grand Duchy 
(by one Shantan to another, never to outsiders), because the use of 
lethal artifacts is widely rumored to have been the cause of the 
explosion that destroyed the Red Tower and its battling occupants and 
left the Daerndar the way they are today. </p>
<p><b>Wards of the Duchy</b></p>
<p>Shantal is protected by strong, mythal-like wards that have the powers of a <i>dimensional anchor </i>spell,
 absorb all natural and magical lightning and electrical discharges and 
all magical fire, and prevent the following magics from functioning: <i>web</i>, <i>hold person</i>, and all <i>invisibility </i>spells.
 They force the cessation of such ongoing effects as they enter the 
Duchy. (A disguised mage riding into the valley would lose his magical 
disguise, and one <i>teleporting </i>in would experience an abrupt end 
to his journey just outside the border of the wards. Flyndara, as the 
creator of the wards, and Chosen of Mystra and other accomplished 
masters of Weave manipulation are exceptions). Note that the wards 
themselves accomplish certain magical translocations (details in the 
next installment of <i>Border Kingdoms</i>).</p>
<p>The wards may also have other, as-yet-unrevealed effects. It is 
rumored that within the Duchal Towers proper, cold-based magic is 
negated, and all shapechanging beings (such as lycanthropes and 
doppelgangers) are forced through a slow, continual cycle of all of the 
shapes they customarily employ. </p>
<p>These wards are absolute in the village of Shantal (and the Daerndar)
 as bordered by the surrounding ring road. Beyond that reach, their 
invisible borders fluctuate from time to time, shifting here and there 
through the outlying farms of the duchy. Some Shantans believe Flyndara 
didn't truly create the wards but merely awakened and modified wards 
created earlier by the Arcanauh. There is general agreement that the 
wards must be powered by some hidden, secret artifact (both beliefs are 
correct, but only Flyndara knows the item that powers the wards and its 
location). The wards were raised to hamper unwanted visitors seeking to 
reach the Daerndar. </p>
<p>Next installment -- the Daerndar.</p>
