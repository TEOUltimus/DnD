<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2007-12%20-%20The%20Border%20Kingdoms%20-%20Dunbridges_files/borderkingdoms_Dunbridges.jpg" align="right" border="1">This
 picturesque, sleepy-looking village meets the eye as a chaotic tangle 
of hedges, meandering paths, and walled gardens studded here and there 
with thatched, thick-walled cottages. Surrounded by rolling pastureland,
 the settlement is dominated by mills and their millponds, 
freely-wandering sheep and goats, and the many small bridges for which 
the place is named. The Dunbridges (named for Aldunn, the dwarf 
stonemason who built them centuries ago) leap over ponds -- and the 
springs that feed them -- in railless arches too narrow for many an 
outland merchant's wagon.</p>
<p align="left">As a result, Dunbradar spend a lot of time hauling 
overturned wagons out of normally-placid local waters by means of 
blocks, pulleys, spars, and horse-winches (almost as much time as 
visiting merchants spend heartily cursing the bridges).</p>
<p align="left">The Dunbradar take such things with patient good humor, 
secure in the prosperity won by their sharp-flavored, Dunbradar cheese 
made of nuts and goats' milk, well-stocked fish ponds, and woolen mills 
which produce distinctive Dunbradar blankets -- always woven in 
green-on-green, swirling patterns that make good camouflage.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Defenses</b></p>
<p align="left">Dunbradar can call on no less than three resident 
adventuring companies of note to repel attempts at brigandry, invasion 
(almost always by the legendarily greedy and belligerent folk of 
Thuntar, who rise every decade or so in another attempt at building an 
empire), and enforced bridge improvements (even by their nominal 
superiors, the Sunbright Lances of High Emmerock). All three companies 
have defended Dunbridges on occasion and have done so in full muster 
together at least twice -- during the Wyrmstrike of 1332 DR (a dragon 
attack) and at the battle of Six Smoking Shields in 1348 DR (the most 
recent resounding defeat of invading Thuntarran armies).</p>
<p align="left">These three stalwart bands are a rollicking, pranksome, 
tankard-tossing rabble of dwarves known as the Merciless 
Manticoreslayers (all outlaws from the dwarven Deep Realm, led by 
Khaladaen of the Double-ended Axe, a LN male gold dwarf Ftr14); the 
all-female Company of the Bent Blade, formed some eighty years ago by 
the daughters of the Company of Sun Knights (who founded High Emmerock; 
half-elven and human, uniformly magnificent in gleaming plate armor and 
mounted on glossy chargers, led by Belabranta Sheltress -- CG female 
Tethyrian human Ftr12/Sor4); and the Deadhelms of Dunbridges, a motley 
crew of semi-retired adventurers and mercenaries from a score of 
kingdoms and a dozen races. The Deadhelms have no real leader, but their
 spokesman is usually the jovially profane and garrulous "One-Eyed Dog,"
 more properly known as Haeronth Blaedaerer (CN male Chondathan human 
Ftr9/Rog7/Streetfighter5 [CA] who wears an <i>eyepatch of shooting stars</i> [properties identical to a <i>ring of shooting stars</i>];
 most Dunbradar don't know his black cloth eyepatch has magical powers, 
but are aware it's false because he shifts it from one eye to the other 
as the whim takes him).</p>
<p align="left">The brawling, boisterous Manticoreslayers make steady 
coin by distilling a strong, rough whisky called "Slayers' Fire" which 
is growing in popularity as merchants take it throughout Faer√ªn. Local 
rumor insists that they are girt in battle with strong defensive magic 
and that their annual "long vacations" are spent hunting and slaying 
dragons for sport.</p>
<p align="left">Rumor further asserts that the ever-wary Deadhelms, who 
dwell in a fortified keep at the western edge of Dunbridges, wield an 
array of strange and powerful magic items. Further, it whispers that 
their leaders are the remnants (human and otherwise) of the crew of a 
ship that sailed through the sky and between the stars!</p>
<p align="left">Not to be done yet, the same ever-tireless rumor mill 
holds that the "Blade Queens" (as the warrior-women of the Company of 
the Bent Blade are affectionately known) are all sorceresses and 
Harpers, or at the very least allies of and spies for Those Who Harp.</p>
<p align="left">The daring exploits (and domestic dalliances, as the 
Blade Queens are endlessly courted by various stalwarts of both other 
companies) provide constant entertainment for Dunbradar and also leave 
them unimpressed by most visiting adventurers. Brigands may be able to 
force Dunbradar folk into doing things, but they'll fail to scare them 
into doing anything. (Adventurers and others given to strong language 
are warned that local folk will only tolerate fellow Dunbradar uttering 
the oath "By the bottoms of the Blade Queens!" Any outlander daring to 
use it will be set upon angrily by all Dunbradar within hearing.)</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Governance</b></p>
<p align="left">Dunbridges is governed by the Mouth, a council of local 
merchants (nominated by any citizen) who serve for three seasons and 
have equal votes. No councilor can serve two consecutive terms. The 
Mouth has eleven members-at-large and a speaker, the Lord of the Bridges
 (currently the fat, sharp-tongued, but essentially good-natured 
Anarassa Ghoeble, a LN female Calishite human Sor12 known to most 
Dunbradar, despite her gender, as "Lord Rassa"). The Lord directly 
commands the only employees of the Mouth -- the Fingers, a dozen-strong 
mounted constabulary (LN male human War6s) who patrol the streets, lead 
the militia, and keep close watch on visitors -- all under the direction
 of <i>their</i> leader, the Lord High Protector.</p>
<p align="left">This general-cum-chief of police is an office which, in 
the past, was often occupied by corrupt villains (several of whom tried 
to take direct rule of Dunbridges and paid for the attempt with their 
lives or were forced to flee far, fast, and permanently). At present it 
is graced by a onetime High Sword (force leader) of Tethyr, the 
principled Tharorgaun Tarntree (a capable, diligent, and ruggedly 
handsome LG male Tethyrian human Ftr16).</p>
<p align="left">Protector Tarntree is square-jawed, tall, keen-eyed, and
 much sought after by local ladies. Though he seems willing to spend 
time in their company, he is always alert and attentive to his duty to 
keep the peace in Dunbridges and guard it against brigand attack. Not 
only does the man never seem to sleep, he has an uncanny knack for 
anticipating trouble and warning a patrol to "check just a little more 
thoroughly than usual <i>there</i>, and tarry a bit in the lee of 
Sarglar's Hill, to watch if wolves slip down." Over the years, the 
Fingers (and the half-dozen different militia members who ride with 
every Fingers patrol) have learned to trust in their Lord Protector's 
hunches. Time and time again, he has directed them into the heart of a 
stealthy brigand advance or hungry winter wolf pack.</p>
<p align="left">This is not to say Tarntree is all grand general. He's 
legendary among the women of Dunbridges for leaping literally out of the
 arms of one amorous lady to snatch up his sword and rush out unclad 
into her barnyard, where he faced a would-be horse thief blade to blade.
 On another occasion, he wrestled a wild dog to death after it tried to 
savage a drunken Dunbradar merchant in the wee hours close enough to his
 open bedchamber window for him to overhear its snarling charge.</p>
<p align="left">Some folk whisper that Tarntree has a colorful past and is a <i>polymorphed</i>
 wizard, courtier, or even Tethyrian princess in hiding from foes who 
would slay him (or her) in an instant if his true identity were 
revealed. Others believe he's a spy for the Harpers -- or the Zhentarim 
-- or even the mysterious island nation of Nimbral (though what a spy 
dwelling in Dunbridges might learn of international value remains a 
matter of unresolved speculation).</p>
<p align="left">The Lord Protector seems to be on wary but cordial terms
 with the three resident adventuring companies. Dunbradar either love 
him (most of the female citizenry) or at least grudgingly respect him 
(most of the men), but even members of the Mouth seem to be spreading 
word of the many strange and close-cloaked visitors who slip in the back
 gate of the Lord High Protector's home, Tarntowers, in the moonlit 
hours of many a night. Lord Rassa donned a cloak and mask of her own 
once to investigate these nocturnal visitations and made it as far as 
halfway down the garden before a lamia noble and a swanmay rose from a 
garden bench to bar her way. In cold, unison tones, they advised her to 
"take a number -- preferably by daylight and at the front gate."</p>
<p align="left">Whatever the truth about Tarntree's visitors, past, and 
secret activities, he guards Dunbridges diligently against attempts to 
do violence to its folk or seize control of it.</p>
<p align="left">And he's not gentle in his methods, either. A mind 
flayer merchant with a wizard in thrall once came to town and tried to 
take over the minds of local millers. Tarntree beheaded the illithid in 
single combat. The grateful, freed wizard cast a preservative spell over
 the head, and today it hangs on pike-point above the Tarntowers front 
gate, eyes glowing faintly and tentacles endlessly and gently curling 
(an eerie sight that has made many a visitor hurry past but of which 
locals have grown quite proud).</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Mysteries</b></p>
<p align="left">Under the eye of its widely-famed Lord High Protector, 
Dunbridges is becoming a supply center of sorts for folk who dislike 
overly tight scrutiny and local laws -- or rather, a place for such folk
 to <i>leave</i> their supplies. The Six Whistlers Lockhouse in the side
 of Sarglar's Hill just northeast of the settlement is a fortress mated 
to a network of caverns where folk can rent space to store whatever they
 need to keep hidden for a while. No one but the Whistlers knows how 
many human warriors guard the Lockhouse fortress gate. The Bold Bards 
adventuring band of Tashluta, who are known to have disputed the fees 
charged by the Whistlers, say that the humans are commanded by 
dopplegangers who shift their appearances so as to make clients think 
there are far more guards than the place really possesses. The Bards 
also claim that the Whistlers themselves are mongrelfolk[FF]. Local 
legend insists that great treasures are hidden in some of the Lockhouse 
caverns -- treasures that would "rock all Faer√ªn and tumble not a few of
 its thrones" should they ever be released.</p>
<p align="left">Perhaps only the watchful gods know what other mysteries
 lurk behind the cozy cottages and bustling little shops of Dunbridges. 
Visitors from larger and more sophisticated places are warned that local
 legend has always hinted that great power lies "hidden, unsleeping" in 
and about the mills and their placid ponds.</p>
