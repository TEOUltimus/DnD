<p align="left"><i> This shrine can be placed along any road anywhere in
 Faerûn due to its peculiar nature. It serves as a roadside place to 
rest, so roads that are used with regularity are better. Like most of 
the entries in this feature, this place can be the setting for a 
dangerous encounter and discovery of an interesting secret, or it can be
 a mere oddity that tweaks the curiosity of the adventurers as they make
 their way somewhere. This adventure locale is suitable for four 
12th-level characters, but it can be very dangerous if they stay too 
long. </i></p>
<p align="center"><b><img src="2004%20-%2011-03%20-%20Adventure%20Locales%20-%20The%20Shrine%20Along%20the%20Way_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></b></p>
<p align="left">Religion is one of the most powerful forces in all 
Faerûn. The deities take a personal interest in the affairs of mortals, 
and occasionally they appear to their faithful. The Time of Troubles 
taught the people of the Realms that though the gods are powerful, their
 worshipers can influence them -- even shape them. A deity's worshipers 
serve as his or her primary tool for affecting the world. Because of 
these realities of the divine, places of worship are the most common 
structures anywhere in the land. Huge temples form the centerpieces of 
powerful metropolises, and shrines exist in smaller towns, villages, and
 even along the road.</p>
<p align="left">Along the road, somewhere between here and there, 
travelers come upon a smallish shrine. It stands alone by the side of 
the road, maybe 20 feet from the roadway itself. Built of common stone 
from the area, it appears very old indeed. The stone is very 
weatherworn, but still very sturdy and solid. Around the shrine the 
traveler sees a number of common native plants forming a garden of 
sorts. The plants have become overgrown a bit, but still the rows and 
paths can be made out. The whole shrine radiates an aura of peaceful 
rest, as if it remains undisturbed by what takes place around it.</p>
<p align="left">The single door to the shrine is closed, but it opens as
 someone approaches. In the wall beside the door is carved "The Shrine 
of Need," which is the name of this place. Within, a dim light from 
windows near the roof reveals a room about 30 feet square, with a stone 
table nearly against the wall on the far side of the room. One could 
just walk between the wall and the table. On the wall above the table is
 inscribed a brightly colored image of a god's holy symbol -- the symbol
 of the god that the visitor worships! This seemingly is a shrine to the
 visitor's own deity. Four stone figures stand in alcoves along the 
sides of the room, two to the left and two to the right. On the left 
stand a warrior in armor and a monk in a ready pose. On the right stand a
 philosopher leaning against a quarterstaff and a priestess with hands 
outstretched toward an imaginary follower. Each of the figures is garbed
 in the clothing appropriate to its role in the visitor's religion via 
illusions (see below). The walls are otherwise bare, and the glass-paned
 windows near the ceiling are too narrow for anyone larger than a gnome 
to slip through. The interior is clean and free of dust, or any sign 
that anyone else has visited this place.</p>
<p align="left">The Shrine of Need is a very strange place. It dates 
back to the earliest days of humans in Faerûn. Created when 
civilizations were few and far between, it served as a place to worship 
any of the gods. To this end, its unknown makers infused it with the 
ability to transform aspects of the shrine via illusions to better suit 
the beliefs of each of its visitors. When a visitor approaches, the 
shrine uses the equivalent of a <i>detect thoughts</i> spell (cast at 
17th level) to determine the deity that the visitor worships. If a group
 enters, the holy symbol illusion shifts to reflect the religion of the 
person who looks upon it. Those without chosen deities see nothing. The 
shrine reflects the visitor's true religious beliefs, even when the 
visitor's thoughts and alignment are otherwise protected. Not even a <i>mind blank</i> effect can interfere with the shrine's power to reflect a visitor's beliefs.</p>
<p align="left">The four statues in the room are stone golems, created 
to protect the shrine and clean it up as needed. The golems animate if 
any violence is committed inside the shrine, and they attack everyone 
involved. They do not follow opponents outside, since their main 
programming is to end any violence within the shrine. As many golems 
animate as seem appropriate to deal with the situation. If the golems 
are damaged, they retreat to their alcoves, which close off (sliding 
stone walls from below). Within the alcove, the golems are slowly 
repaired by the magic imbued into the shrine. Repairing a golem takes a 
month, so it is possible to visit the shrine and see only three statues 
and a wall where a fourth alcove would be. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Stone Golems (4):</b> CR 11; hp 110; see <i>Monster Manual </i>page 136. This combat spans the range of EL 11-15, depending on how many golems animate.</p>
<p align="left">Bodies are absorbed through the floor in a process that 
takes about a day. Beneath the floor, there is a vast mulching tank that
 is filled with small organisms that eat dead flesh. The dead are 
mulched and then directed toward the roots of the plants surrounding the
 shrine. Equipment from the dead is not absorbed through the floor, but 
once the bodies are gone, a golem animates, cleans everything out and 
dumps it all in a pit behind the garden in back of the shrine. The pit 
is not visible at a casual glance (Spot DC 25 to see signs of it), 
because the top is partly overgrown by a matted vine plant. The golems 
just drop things through the plant.</p>
<p align="left">Within this 20-foot-deep pit are the following items 
(though DMs are encouraged to adjust this list to suit their campaign 
needs): three suits of chainmail, one badly rusted; a <i>+2 frost wooden scimitar;</i> and a quantity of rust dust beneath the items. All the items look to have been dropped here within the last year.</p>
<p align="left">The pit is also the home of a mated pair of rust 
monsters. The monsters live in a hollowed-out side of the pit, which is 
not visible from the surface. They have found the continual supply of 
metal to be to their liking, and they have no plans to move. They also 
have no plans to die and will flee if overwhelmed.</p>
<p align="left">Also, an ethereal filcher hangs around the area. The 
filcher carries off any magic items that survive the attentions of the 
rust monsters after a few days.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rust Monsters</b><b>(2):</b> CR 3; hp 27; see <i>Monster Manual </i>page 216.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ethereal Filcher:</b> CR 3; hp 22; see <i>Monster Manual </i>page 104.</p>
<p align="left">Some time ago, the shrine developed a kind of sickness. A priest of Bane (Hextor in the standard <b>D&amp;D</b>
 pantheon) was fleeing some avenging do-gooders when he ran across the 
shrine. Happy to unexpectedly find a shrine to Bane in the middle of 
nowhere (so to speak), he ran inside. He prayed to Bane for deliverance,
 and the Black Lord sent help in the form of a malebranche sorcerer. 
This powerful devil attacked the forces of good immediately, in company 
with the priest. However, they were outmatched and were forced to 
retreat to the shrine. The priest died in the retreat. The devil did not
 die, but it also did not return to the Hells. Instead, Bane caused it 
to join with the shrine and lose its own body in the process.</p>
<p align="left">Now the shrine has an evil bent, and it is slowly being 
turned completely to evil. This becomes evident if one stays a while 
there. After an hour, elements of the holy symbol on the wall are 
replaced with elements of the holy symbol of Bane. This should appear as
 a gradual corruption, so that Bane's part is not recognized for a few 
hours. After 2 hours, the stone golems animate and attack anyone in the 
shrine, acting as if violence was detected. Eventually, the holy symbol 
turns to that of Bane, and an <i>unhallow</i> spell is cast inside. The 
mood starts to get darker and feel more oppressive. After 6 hours, the 
malebranche starts casting spells at the intruders, which seem to 
originate from the holy symbol. Once everyone leaves, and someone 
reenters, the whole process is reset and it takes another hour for the 
devil to start to exert its nature.</p>
<p align="left">Freeing the shrine requires considerable power. A successful <i>dismissal</i>, <i>banishment</i>, or <i>dispel evil</i>
 spell forces the malebranche out of the shrine and back into its own 
body. It appears in the center of the shrine and attacks immediately. A 
successful <i>wish </i>or <i>miracle</i> spell returns the malebranche to its own plane.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Charge (Ex):</b> In addition to the normal benefits 
and hazards of a charge, the malebranche sorcerer can make a single gore
 attack (+33 melee) that does 6d6+18 points of damage. It can make this 
charge while flying or while moving on the ground.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> As a free action, the malebranche sorcerer can produce a fear effect like a <i>fear</i>
 spell (caster level 22nd; Will save DC 20 to resist), except that it 
affects everyone within a 15-foot radius of himself. A creature that 
saves cannot be affected again by this power for 24 hours. All baatezu 
are immune to this ability. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If the malebranche sorcerer 
hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself 
with a claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a 
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity 
(grapple bonus +41). The malebranche sorcerer has the option to conduct 
the grapple normally, or simply use its claws to hold the opponent (-20 
penalty on grapple check, but the malebranche sorcerer is not considered
 grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it makes 
during successive rounds automatically deals claw damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Baatezu Traits:</b> The malebranche sorcerer is 
immune to fire and poison. It has resistance to acid 10 and cold 10. As a
 supernatural ability, it can see perfectly in even magical darkness. It
 can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that 
has a language as a supernatural ability.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Outsider Traits:</b> A malebranche sorcerer cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected (though a <i>limited wish, wish, miracle,</i> or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore life). It has darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Regeneration (Ex): </b>A malebranche sorcerer takes normal damage from acid, from holy weapons, and from attacks that deal holy damage.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Sorcerer Spells Known</i> (caster level 10th): 0 -- <i>acid splash</i> (ranged touch +22), <i>dancing lights, detect magic, ghost sound</i> (DC 13), <i>mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost</i> (ranged touch +22), <i>read magic, resistance;</i> 1st -- <i>expeditious retreat, mage armor, magic missile, magic weapon, shield; </i>2nd -- <i>eagle's splendor, resist energy, scorching ray</i> (ranged touch +22), <i>see invisibility; </i>3rd -- <i>displacement, fireball, ray of exhaustion</i> (ranged touch +22, DC 16); 4th -- <i>bestow curse</i> (DC 17), <i>greater invisibility;</i> 5th -- <i>feeblemind</i> (DC 18). </p>
