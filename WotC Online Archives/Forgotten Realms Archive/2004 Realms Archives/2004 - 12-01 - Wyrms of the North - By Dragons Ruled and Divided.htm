<p align="left">Volo is justly proud of his efforts in assembling lore 
on dragons who currently flourish in the Sword Coast North, so he has 
prepared this wyrm-by-wyrm summary of their nameless dominions and 
attitudes toward intruders (for sale as a pamphlet to interested 
adventurers throughout the North). </p>

<p align="left">The notorious mage Elminster edited much of Volo's 
draconic work, but he opposes the idea of "a bloodthirsty adventurer's 
guide to dragons" and has refused to correct errors and omissions herein
 -- save to warn readers that he can call to mind almost forty dragons 
active in the area who are missing from this survey. In other words, 
don't think that dragon's territories are quite so tidy as the map shows
 . . . or that these wyrms are the only draconic dangers awaiting a 
traveler.</p>

<p align="left">From his lair in the Lonefang, this old male white 
dragon tirelessly patrols a domain that stretches from the Cold Run east
 to Mount Gaumarath (northernmost peak of the Ice Mountains) along the 
Spine of the World, with an unknown northern boundary and a "bump" 
extending southeast from the Fell Pass in a great arc to take in all the
 land north of Mithril Hall and the Citadel of Many Arrows (the 
headwaters of the River Surbrin). Arauthator never hunts in the 
Moonwood, the Coldwood, or Icewind Dale, but he seeks to slay any dragon
 who encroaches on his dominion. He delights in battle but is far more 
patient than most dragons. He spends much of his time scouring out 
tunnels beneath the Endless Ice Sea, gleefully devouring the remorhaz he
 finds there.</p>
<p align="left">To Arauthator, all cold-dwelling creatures are prey to 
be devoured. Dragons and other formidable foes are rivals to be 
destroyed or driven away. If that means letting them explore the domain 
or lair unchallenged for a time, so be it. Only Arveiaturace is 
acceptable as a mate, and she is always escorted out of the domain when 
her pregnancy is achieved. Explorers, prospectors, and adventurers are 
the worst invading perils but might be misdirected into wild goose 
chases or into attacking other nearby wyrms. Avalanches are useful 
weapons against all foes.</p>
<p align="left">If prospectors find ore, Arauthator immediately leaves 
them unmolested and tries not to show himself in the sky nearby; mining 
communities mean sledge- or wagon-trains of ore pulled by dragon meals, 
and humans always bring livestock. If a dragon obligingly devours the 
stock, the miners must bring more, starve in the worst winter months, or
 leave (and on the journey out, unwittingly offer themselves as meals).</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20011205a">Arveiaturace</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Iceclaws/The White Worm)</p>
<p align="left">From her lair in the Icepeaks, this ancient female white
 dragon holds sway over a territory that stretches over the Trackless 
Sea from Tuern and the Sea of Moving Ice south to the shores of Lantan, 
bounded on the east by the headlands of the Sword Coast from Tethyr 
north to Mount Sar, and on the west by an invisible line running 
parallel to the Sword Coast that begins as far west as one can fly and 
still see Tuern, and runs well east of Gundarlun, Mintarn, and the 
Moonshaes. Arveiaturace sometimes hunts into the Crags and northern 
Neverwinter Wood, but other dragons (notably Claugiyliamatar) dispute 
her right to this region.</p>
<p align="left">A loner except when she (rarely) mates with Arauthator 
and rears his progeny, Arveiaturace is intelligent, sensitive, 
suspicious, and always vigilant. She regards humans -- particularly 
those aboard ships -- as her food, and she loves plunging into wild 
battle-lust when fighting creatures who fly into her air over the Sea of
 Swords. On the other hand, her loneliness often drives her to spare 
those who talk with her. She respects and is respected by Laeral, the 
Lady Mage of Waterdeep, and the shipwright Old Aldon of Mintarn. She 
seeks a powerful wizard she can trust to be her companion and rider.</p>
<p align="left">Arveiaturace is not above filling the ears of a 
conversationalist she has decided to spare with tales of "The Lost 
Treasure Isle of the Nine Wizards" (which most sages agree is wholly her
 invention): an island somewhere between the Moonshaes and Evermeet that
 rises from time to time, displaying the drowned towers of the wizards 
-- crammed with their magic items, gems, and gold -- for a season or so 
before sinking once more. Of course, according to Arveiaturace, it has 
always just surfaced -- just the thing for ship after ship of greedy 
Amnians, Nelanther pirates, and bold Baldurians to come seeking . . . or
 ship after ship of meals for a sea-roving white worm.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20020130a">Balagos</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Bahor, Dragonbane, The Flying Flame, The Dragon King)</p>
<p align="left">This male red great wyrm's domain stretches from the 
southern edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the Giant's Run Mountains 
and from the south bank of the upper River Chionthar (nigh Iriaebor) to 
the River Ith. The entire Wealdath and fringes of this dominion are 
claimed by other dragons, but the Flying Flame has a rather casual 
attitude toward draconic dominion that other dragons have learned to 
accept. (Most hide when they see him, or keep to their lairs and ignore 
his passage.) Balagos considers all Faerûn his; other wyrms are merely 
custodians of areas within it, holding their positions and lives at his 
pleasure. Betimes he slays a random dragon to keep others in fear, then 
flies over half of Faerûn in slow triumph with his victim's corpse 
dangling from his jaws for all to see.</p>
<p align="left">A megalomaniac, Balagos is a fearless, ruthless foe who 
delights in slaughtering adventurers, wizards, and dragons alike. He 
possesses three outstanding talents: He never forgets the appearance, 
name, or manner of any encountered being; he's a shrewd judge of 
character; and he considers consequences and likely outcomes. No foe is 
to be underestimated, but no being is worthy of his friendship and love,
 or no being will be allowed to remain in any place (or in possession of
 any property) the Flying Flame desires for himself. He loves to take 
spectacular and public revenge on all who defy or withstand him.</p>
<p align="left">For the last two summers, Balagos has been smoldering 
over his inability to find and slay a band of Harpers who plundered a 
cache of magic only months after he'd established it. Worse, word of 
their endeavor has spread among Harpers, and everywhere the dragon flies
 he hears the taunting tune played by a "singing sword" that was among 
the loot stolen from him; some Harpers who've never seen the sword, but 
who've had its tune played to them, employ minor spells to make its 
melody when they see Balagos. At first, the dragon's rage lured him into
 a variety of traps -- but now he snarls and waits, cursing Harpers and 
devising ways to bring about the deaths of all who harp.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20020227a">Claugiyliamatar</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Old Gnawbone)</p>
<p align="left">From her lair in Deeping Cave, this ancient female green
 dragon commands a domain stretching down the Sword Coast from the south
 bank of the River Mirar to the north bank of the Dessarin. Almost all 
of this territory is claimed by other dragons, but Claugiyliamatar cares
 not. She seldom leaves her lair, preferring to scheme and watch the 
world through scrying crystals while employing dozens of humans and 
halflings to carry out her will. She abandons her idleness, however, to 
defend her territory against intruding dragons. She enjoys devouring 
adventurers and entire caravans.</p>
<p align="left">Cunning, paranoid, and utterly cruel, Claugiyliamatar 
dwells alone, driving away male green dragons who come courting. Through
 her agents, she enjoys manipulating affairs in Neverwinter and 
Waterdeep. Most of Old Gnawbone's earnings are invested so as to stir up
 rivalries and strengthen organizations she controls to create more 
trouble and squeeze profits anew.</p>
<p align="left">Claugiyliamatar is fascinated by human and elven women 
who wield power, and she spends hours scrying them. She's also 
interested in magic, especially items that enable her to take on human 
form and retain her draconic powers. She hungers to participate in the 
bustle and intrigue of city life, from knifings in alleyways to 
passionate courting and drinking. Since her own spells are too feeble to
 win her human shape, she spies on nobles and mages to learn who has 
magic and where they keep it hidden, so as to send her agents forth to 
steal it. She has no interest in the company of other dragons, and she 
values other beings only as tools.</p>
<p align="left">Her most recent tool is the Blood-Red Crown, a dozen 
bored and jaded young noble ladies of Waterdeep who formed their own 
adventuring band to feel both excited and important. They carry trifling
 magics, but Claugiyliamatar has been covertly directing them to tombs 
and ruins in or near Neverwinter and Waterdeep. The ladies of the Crown 
have turned up only magic too minor to be worth relieving them of, thus 
far, but Old Gnawbone is awaiting the day when they find something 
really useful -- and she can send in agents to seize it.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20020327a">Daurgothoth</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Creeping Doom)</p>
<p align="left">From his lair in Dolblunde, this dracolich (in life, a 
male black great wyrm) spies on a territory bounded by the coast from 
the mouth of the Dessarin to Mount Sar, east to Amphail and Bargewright 
Inn, and thence down the Dessarin to the sea once more. Daurgothoth 
concentrates on road traffic in his scrying. He is interested in all 
things magical and news of dragon activity. To escape detection by 
prying mages and adventurers, he seldom acts openly.</p>
<p align="left">Daurgothoth is obsessed with two goals: gaining 
abilities of other dragon breeds to become the supreme dragon, and 
"coming back to life" sufficiently to sire his own new dragon species. 
He continually strives to improve his spells and find a suitable mate --
 or construct one, much as he was modified in undeath to gain a tail 
sting and various breath weapons.</p>
<p align="left">He'll energetically slaughter any being who discovers 
his endeavors or finds his lair, including bands of adventurers working 
for him whom he judges have begun to learn too much about him. 
Daurgothoth uses <i>project image</i> spells to speak with underlings 
while posing as a deliberately mysterious human mage, directing them in 
shady dealings in Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Secomber. 
His initial bold acquisitions of magic alarmed mages and authorities, so
 he has taken to working through a web of unwitting thieves and 
unscrupulous merchants. Daurgothoth is a brilliant crafter of magic, 
endlessly inquisitive, and a miss-nothing observer with an impressive 
memory. He is paranoid, patient, and calm, and he can't be goaded or 
blinded by pride.</p>
<p align="left">From time to time, he feels the need for companionship 
and music, so he seeks out traveling bards, seldom offering them 
violence or revealing his true nature. Fearing capture by the Cult of 
the Dragon, he strikes at its agents whenever he can do so without 
revealing the location of his lair. He recently discovered 
Claugiyliamatar's pet adventuring band and intends to use them to trace 
her -- so he can wind up holding the magic of both Crown and green 
dragon, no matter how much blood it's drenched in.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20020522a">Deszeldaryndun Silverwing</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Guardian Worm of Everlund, The Kindly Dragon)</p>
<p align="left">From "Softwing," the lair in the Floating Mountain he 
shares with the gold dragon Valamaradace, this adult male silver dragon 
roams a territory determined and patrolled by his consort. Its borders 
consist of the Moonwood, a line southeast through Dead Ore Pass to 
Sundabar, thence southwest along the River Rauvin to Turlangtor, and on 
into the Woods of Turlang as far as the Lost Peaks, thence along the 
Dessarin to a point south of Flint Rock, and from there due north across
 the Evermoors to the River Surbrin, and along its banks back to the 
Moonwood again.</p>
<p align="left">Silverwing is graceful, prudent, good-humored, and 
helpful to humans and other civilized folk in need -- usually providing 
healing and shelter, but sometimes assisting them in personal endeavors 
and goals. He avoids human society and politics but works behind the 
scenes against trolls, orc hordes, and other evils, preferring to make 
foes simply vanish. He and his consort dislike the open hunting and 
spreading of fear practiced by many dragons.</p>
<p align="left">Deszeldaryndun prefers to render aid in disguise, but he
 won't hesitate to reveal his true powers. A shrewd judge of character, 
he uses magic covertly to probe alignments and true natures. He prefers a
 simple life in the wilds and frequent human contact on his own terms, 
spending much of his time posing as a human woodcutter or -- with her 
permission -- as the human sorceress Alustriel -- whom he's spent enough
 time working with that he can portray her flawlessly. Silverwing enjoys
 conversation with intelligent and sensitive good-aligned humans. He has
 a natural talent for mimicry, specializing in human and half-elven 
voices, movements, and mannerisms. He is an accomplished singer and 
loves gossip, learning secrets, and seeing the overall implications of 
human activities in the North. Disinterested in (and ignorant of) the 
doings of other dragons, Deszeldaryndun hates only dracoliches and the 
Cult of the Dragon, but he investigates all intruders into his shared 
domain with an eye to keeping it free of oppression and murderous 
destruction.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20030618a">Eldenser</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Worm Who Hides in Blades, The Lurker)</p>
<p align="left">This amethyst male great wyrm uses magic to leave his 
withered, wasted, magically preserved body in "secure" hideaways and 
transfer his sentience into the blade of any tempered, edged metal 
weapon (from whence he can perceive and employ his magic as if in his 
own body). In this form, he roams all Faerûn inside swords, considering 
none of it his territory, but all of it his to freely traverse.</p>
<p align="left">Eldenser ignores other dragons unless they discover him,
 whereupon he'll cheerfully do battle against attempts to menace or 
control him or anyone wielding "his" blade. He has little interest in 
slaying other dragons but dislikes fleeing from them, preferring to best
 or outwit them. A fan of adventurers (who as blade-carriers can bring 
him excitement and travel), Eldenser is wary only of spellcasters who 
want to magically examine the blade he's in -- and actively aids and 
spies on anyone working on magic that might allow a dragon to regenerate
 or replace an aged, crumbling body.</p>
<p align="left">He currently devotes himself to observing the beauties 
of Faerûn and the entertaining strivings of its inhabitants (half-elves,
 humans, and elves in particular); trying to influence political events 
to aid heroes, weaken authority, and generally promote opportunities for
 entertainment to observe in the future; and following a mysterious 
process for achieving draconic immortality known as Ossavitor's Way. 
Eldenser recently learned a spell that enables him (from within a blade,
 and silently) to briefly animate a nearby nonmagical bladed weapon 
smaller than the blade he's in -- such as a dagger -- and he uses this

<p align="left">(The Flying Misfortune)</p>
<p align="left">This juvenile male bronze dragon roams Faerûn more or 
less freely, ignoring territories claimed by other creatures -- and most
 beings have learned that it's easiest to ignore his intrusions.(He's 
clumsy and has a knack of crashing into or unintentionally destroying 
things, blundering into the midst of delicate or dangerous situations, 
and generally causing mayhem.) Fighting or trying to entrap him always 
carries a cost, and Felgolos clearly has no intention of carving out a 
domain of his own, seizing treasure, or competing for food.</p>
<p align="left">Possessed of sleek build, unshakable curiosity, and 
unfailing good nature, Felgolos refuses to make enemies or to be 
prudent, and he wanders Faerûn intruding everywhere and blithely 
venturing into great danger. Through years of peering about in perpetual
 wonderment, Felgolos has led a charmed life; though he's often been 
hurt and forced to flee, he has survived. Sensitive to the wants and 
needs of others (once he learns them), he tends to avoid mated dragons 
he knows are rearing young. News of perils, however, attracts Felgolos 
rather than deterring him. He is afraid of no creature and views no one 
as his foe -- until they've attacked him. Curiosity as to the doings of 
others rules him.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20020828a">Galadaeros</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Sunset Flame, The Flame Dragon)</p>
<p align="left">From the island of Flamehome (also known as "Galadros" 
or "the Dragon's Isle"), this mature adult male copper dragon roams the 
waters in a wide circle that takes in the Purple Rocks, fiercely 
defending them against encroaching dragons. However, he considers 
himself exempt from the territorial claims of other dragons and flies 
wherever he wills. Outside his own domain, his encounters with dragons 
are as polite, brief, and casual as possible; he offers no menace, 
ignores it when offered to him, and soon departs. Galadaeros lairs in a 
caverns in the highest peak on Flamehome and is said to have three 
wizshades, or female wild mages, or even some of the Seven Sisters, as 
servants. He spends his days acting as the steed, reinforcements, and 
advisor to the all-female Galadran Company, between twenty and thirty 
female human adventurers (derisively known as "Sharptongues") whose 
ranks originally consisted of highborn Waterdhavian ladies. Galadaeros 
is gentle and good humored, lacking typical draconic pride, and he has 
an uncanny ability to judge the needs and schemes of humans (females in 
particular). He has few known foes, but the Cult of the Dragon -- and 
adventurers who come to Flamehome intending to carry away treasure or 
attack the Galadrans -- are definitely among them.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20020925a">Gaulauntyr</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Glorytongue, The Thief Dragon)</p>
<p align="left">This mature adult female topaz dragon lairs on the tiny 
islet of Alsapir's Rock, just offshore near Mount Sar, and she roams the
 Sword Coast from Baldur's Gate to Luskan, usually near Waterdeep or the
 outer Moonshaes, but sometimes reaching the Nelanther. Gaulauntyr is 
solitary dragon and moves about often to avoid other dragons (preferring
 a life of stealth in and about human cities to slumbering in a lair in 
the heart of a territory). She finds the City of Splendors increasingly 
crowded with dragons (and other formidable beings) working undercover 
and so makes far fewer and more timid forays into it than she once did.</p>
<p align="left">Glorytongue spends her days watching human life on the 
Sword Coast and devising new ways to steal gems or food. (She loves 
exotic cheeses.) One of the most intelligent -- and paranoid -- dragons 
of the North, she cloaks her true form in illusions and hides whenever 
possible. An accomplished mimic of human voices, she has a wry and 
shrewd grasp of human and draconic nature, always having a ready escape 
route, a scheme to disappear or adopt a disguise, and secondary plans if
 the first one fails.</p>
<p align="left">Gaulauntyr's nickname comes from her habit of delivering
 touch spells with her elongated tongue (and the spell she uses to so 
transform her tongue). Many dragons and others she has robbed seek to 
recover their losses, but Glorytongue has no strong and persistent foes 
(the Cult of the Dragon will become such if they ever discover who's 
behind all of the dragon-hoard thefts). Increasingly, she's taken to 
robbing exhausted or wounded adventurers who've made camp or gone to 
sleep in a "secure" stronghold.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20021023a">Hoondarrh</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Red Rage of Mintarn, The Red Terror, The Sleeping Wyrm of Skadaurak)</p>
<p align="left">This venerable male red dragon considers coastal islands
 up and down the Sword Coast his domain but roams Faerûn at will 
(avoiding magic-strong realms such as Evermeet, Thay, and Halruaa), 
preferring to hunt in the Shaar or wilderness backlands. Though large 
and aggressive, Hoondarrh feels his vigor lessening. Increasingly he 
avoids other dragons, though he remains a fighter of experience and 
cunning, possesses the skills of an increasingly accomplished 
spellcaster, and commands the formidable magic of the Ongild, a magical 
emerald that lies in his innards.</p>
<p align="left">The folk of Mintarn pay Hoondarrh tribute money in 
return for his protection against pirates. He delights in toying with 
ships south of Mintarn; only his Long Sleeps have kept humans from 
abandoning water travel in the region. Between slumbers, he entertains 
himself by watching human doings (mostly in Waterdeep). He rewards those
 whose pranks, bold deceptions, treacheries, and intrigues amuse him -- 
but he tirelessly hunts down anyone who dares to steal from him. 
Hoondarrh often plays elaborate deceptions of his own and regards 
adventurers seeking his hoard or life as entertainment. The recent feud 
between the Stoneshields dwarven adventuring band and the elven White 
Flower Venturers was Hoondarrh's doing . . . and so were the tales that 
the lost Spell Throne of Malavarr (a high-backed seat that floats about 
and enables nonspellcasters seated on it to unleash powerful magics) had
 been found by a Waterdhavian noble family and hidden in a cellar 
somewhere in the city for their personal use.</p>
<p align="left">The Red Rage dreams of a mate and offspring -- and is 
becoming increasingly impatient for the achievement of immortality, for 
he dares not allow himself intimacy until secure in its everlasting 
protection. He seeks word of wizards working on magic concerned with 
eternal life or enhanced longevity, and he seizes magic items that might
 help him win eternal life. In the meantime, he prolongs his natural 
lifespan by sleeping for decades or centuries at a time.</p>

<p align="left">(The Doom of the Desert, The Dragon of the Statues)</p>
<p align="left">Driven by all-consuming ambition, this female blue wyrm 
lairs in a nameless ruined city in Anauroch, northeast of Ascore. She 
slays all intruders and is attended by many gargoyles of her own 
creation. The gargoyles fly patrols, tunnel the city to keep back the 
sand, and transport rocks from nearby mountains to expand the "windbreak
 dune" wall on the windward side of the city. Iymrith also controls a 
band of adventurers, the Company of the Flame Spider, whom she keeps 
trapped outside the city and uses to attack intruders.</p>
<p align="left">Iymrith roams the western edge of Anauroch as far south 
as to be within sight of the Greycloak Hills, as far west as the eastern
 High Forest, and north to where the Ice Mountains meet the glaciers. 
She is continually trying to build and animate new bodies for herself, 
so she can move from body to body and forever cheat death. She will do 
anything to gain all the magic she can and so rise to supremacy over all
 Faerûn. Then she can live forever, crafting ever-stronger magic. No one
 knows if she'll ever feel secure enough to think of mating, dwelling 
elsewhere, or sharing her magic -- but for now she's an enthusiastic 
menace to all who venture within her reach.</p>
<p align="left">That reach may soon extend much farther than before: 
Iymrith has just stumbled on a means of opening short-lived (sunset to 
sunset) <i>portals</i> in distant locations (such as rich cities in 
Sembia, Amn, and in Waterdeep itself) and is sending raiding parties of 
gargoyles through them in search of magic. If she perfects a spell she 
is working on that will allow her to temporarily inhabit a gargoyle body
 and suffer no harm if it's destroyed, the Doom of the Desert (with 
spells at the ready) may soon join such forays -- and begin her grand 
plan of looting every mage's tower in Toril.</p>

<p align="left">A mature adult female steel dragon who doesn't defend a 
territory, Jalanvaloss is happy to share the city of Waterdeep with 
other dragons who hide in human shape as she does. She tolerates the 
brief visits of such worms as Galadaeros (keeping herself hidden) but 
reveals herself to savagely fight off any dragon who dares to attack 
Waterdhavians, despoil the city . . . or do her ill.</p>
<p align="left">Jalanvaloss is a keen observer, never forgetting the 
smallest details, and she seems to revel in being part of as many 
intrigues and deceptions as possible. She's an actress of the first rank
 and an adequate mimic, and she enjoys manipulating others and scheming.
 Over years of residence in Waterdeep (in a succession of assumed female
 human guises), she has become expert in recalling the genealogies, 
relationships, cabals, and alliances of Waterdhavians high and low. She 
is active in city underlife but also enjoys the entertainment provided 
by the pretensions and indulgences of its nobles.</p>
<p align="left">Once the steed of the wizard Rythtalies, Jalanvaloss was
 magically altered by him (in a process lost with his demise) and is now
 a spellcasting prodigy, though she wasn't born one.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20030226a">Klauth</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Old Snarl)</p>
<p align="left">A huge, scarred male great wyrm red dragon, Klauth is 
known for swift and brutal attacks but has recently retired into 
brooding paranoia in his lair of "Klauthen Vale" (a narrow, winding 
valley in the mountains east of Raven Rock) to build his strength, 
awaiting the day when he'll be powerful enough to emerge as the 
unquestioned master of dragonkind. Habitually snarling and savage, he's 
also unpredictable -- and may aid stricken creatures (except dragons, 
whom he drives away or slays on sight) rather than devouring them. 
Dragon eggs are a favorite meal (save for those of red dragons, which 
Klauth uses to magically augment his vitality). He has never mated or 
shown kindness to another dragon.</p>
<p align="left">Klauth leaves his valley on rare forays to smite 
potential rivals and to search for the hoards of two white dragons he 
slew. He doesn't defend a domain and considers himself free to roam (but
 recognizes that sightseeing over Waterdeep or Iymrith's desert city 
would be dangerous and imprudent). Recent prudence has led him to employ
 stealth, invade other dragons' domains only for specific reasons, and 
perform tasks quickly and efficiently. Over the years he has become an 
expert on creatures of the North and acquired magical means of affixing 
wands to his wings and firing them as he swoops at foes. He is thought 
to have bargained information with Alustriel of the Seven to gain a 
"live and let live" agreement. Like Iymrith, he is experimenting with 
spells allowing him to transfer his intellect from body to body -- in 
Klauth's case, bodies grown from red dragon eggs (once he masters how to
 create fully grown dragons without minds of their own, that he can 
store in magical stasis until he needs them).</p>

<p align="left">(The Claws of the Coast, Mother Wyrm)</p>
<p align="left">A homely, whimsical, kindly, and inquisitive very old 
female bronze dragon, Mother Wyrm is famous for owning and operating her
 own Sword Coast merchant shipping fleet, the Scaly Eye, and for her 
"swoop from the sky" rescues of shipwrecked humans. Her fleet is over 
two dozen vessels strong, and she often appears when one is endangered 
(suggesting she magically farscries their progress). She preys largely 
on pirates; her depredations have made the Nelanther passable to 
shipping in recent years. Lhammaruntosz often transfers "fast mail" 
messages and small items from ship to ship, using "flyover" droplines.</p>
<p align="left">Lacking pride and disinterested in territory, 
Lhammaruntosz avoids combat whenever possible and never lingers to 
destroy foes, simply striking to defend herself, end an urgent problem, 
and be on her way. She carries magic items that can cause deadly midair 
acid-ball explosions, and she has vigorous personal regenerative powers 
that allow her to largely ignore the elements.</p>
<p align="left">Lhammaruntosz doesn't regard her roaming as defining an 
exclusive domain; she'll ignore or calmly greet and pass other dragons 
who treat her the same way, fighting only those who offer her battle or 
attack her friends or Scaly Eye folk or property. She has two lairs, a 
hidden inland hoard-home and a "resting lair" in the heights of 
Orlumbor, and she is almost always on Orlumbor or flying along the Sword
 Coast, visiting coastal agents (and avoiding Waterdeep and Baldur's 
Gate).</p>
<p align="left">Mother Wyrm recently ordered six large, fast new 
merchant caravels built for her in Waterdeep; it is rumored she 
discovered a bay somewhere in the Nelanther where over a dozen sunken 
ships lie, crammed with pirate treasure.</p>

<p align="left">(The Dragon Unseen, The Unseen Dragon)</p>
<p align="left">This very old male sapphire dragon dwells in a vast 
cavern network beneath the Graypeak Mountains that he calls his Realm of
 Stone and Shadow. Scrying mirrors drift slowly along its passages, and 
Malaeragoth uses them often to spy on Faerûn, bending much of his 
attention on Sembia and the Cult of the Dragon (sometimes posing as a 
human while using them to seek advice from or manipulate 
surface-dwellers). Malaeragoth commands legions of skeletons and 
zombies, but he has no allies and prefers solitude.</p>
<p align="left">Beyond his extensive lair, Malaeragoth claims no 
territory but considers himself free to travel anywhere. On his rare 
flying forays, he doesn't hesitate to fight if anyone bars or disputes 
his way. He watches over approaches to his lair, having developed an 
intense dislike of surprise guests and visitations. Patient and shrewd, 
he hates the Cult of the Dragon and has become so expert at manipulating
 it (through magical guises and unwitting agents) that he's well on the 
way to controlling it.</p>
<p align="left">Recently, he has hit upon the idea of befriending 
adventurers (while posing as a human) and aiding them in rising to rule 
the realms of Faerûn -- while magically eavesdropping on their minds. 
The Unseen Dragon prefers keeping his manipulations hidden over 
controlling his pawns into precisely achieving his own goals -- but the 
extent of his manipulations, and numbers of folk involved as his agents,
 are staggering.</p>

<p align="left">(The Sentinel Wyrm)</p>
<p align="left">All that remains of this former female silver great wyrm
 is a malevolent, diligent guardian force bound under Candlekeep, as she
 has been for over fifteen hundred years. In that time, her lair, a 
pillarlike islet just offshore from Ulgoth's Beard, collapsed into the 
sea. Miirym once roamed coastal lands between the High Moor and the Sea 
of Swords (and as far offshore as Mintarn), south to the Cloud Peaks, 
and north to Mount Helimbrar, but her territory is now as lost as her 
name and body.</p>
<p align="left">Today Miirym is little more than an all-seeing set of 
spectral jaws that can bite or unleash any chromatic or metallic breath 
weapon. Tortured by loneliness, her sanity isn't strong. She craves 
converse and companionship (and of course, freedom to roam all Faerûn in
 her own body again), and treachery or sneak attacks upon her evoke 
savage, furious attacks in return. Trapped in endless guardianship of 
Candlekeep, Miirym roams a sharply limited "domain" of subterranean 
passages accompanied only by the occasional monk and by floating, 
spell-reflecting "glass guardian" spheres. She'll attack all intruders 
who seek to force their way up into Candlekeep, or anyone bearing any 
sort of scroll, book, or writing.</p>

<p align="left">(The Moor Dragon)</p>
<p align="left">A priestess of Shar trapped in dragon shape by rivals, 
this young adult female green dragon lairs in the Rockshaws, a 
monster-haunted, trackless region of broken country in the northeastern 
High Moor. She lairs in extensive caverns beneath Greenleaf Vale (a 
forested bowl valley) but uses them only when wounded or as shelter from
 fierce wintry weather, spending most of her time spying on the doings 
of others or basking on high mountain ledges around Amn, plotting. 
Mornauguth seems to ignore the very concept of draconic territory, never
 defending her own lair nor caring if she angers other dragons by her 
roamings. Only fear of being caught over water curtails her wanderings, 
which are concerned with the doings of the Sharran clergy, rival 
priesthoods, and other human intrigues, broken by hunting trips and 
explorative forays. The only "domain" she'll defend against other 
dragons are the Sharran temples of Faerûn (Amn in particular).</p>
<p align="left">Subsisting on wild game, adventurers, and caravans, 
Mornauguth desperately wants her human form back. She prays often to 
Shar for this boon and gives all the wealth she gains to the Dark 
Embrace temple in Amn. At least once a month she performs some daring 
deed (often a raid on a state building, palace, jail, or fortress) in 
the name of Shar. On rare occasions, clergy of the Dark Embrace request 
her service as a steed or aid in an attack on a strong target (usually a
 Selûnite temple), and so far she has given it willingly; how long 
she'll continue to do so without any reward or sign of Shar's favor 
remains to be seen.</p>

<p align="left">(The Drow Dragon, The Dark Lady)</p>
<p align="left">This adult female dragon is actually a form of song 
dragon, changing between drow and shadow dragon forms. Using illusion 
spells to appear human, she poses as the Dark Lady of Rundreth Manor, a 
ruin overlooking the Long Road north of Amphail, and lures men thence. 
Most she robs, slays, and devours at leisure, but some she seduces and 
releases. Freed consorts who speak of the Dark Lady are hunted down and 
destroyed; those who keep silent and remain friendly are suffered to 
live. (Nurvureem uses the men who walk away devoted to her to bring her 
back magic items, potions, and spell scrolls -- and to keep her informed
 of adventurers and Cult of the Dragon agents.) Occasionally she visits 
one of these "Faithful Few" for companionship and to check on their 
doings. Those who prove weak or turn against her become coerced allies, 
fearful servants, or (most often) swiftly dead. Some of them remain her 
willing servants lifelong. She seems to be seeking longtime friends, and
 perhaps a suitable mate.</p>
<p align="left">Only human, half-elven, and elven spellcasters 
customarily impress Nurvureem; she treats such individuals with care 
until she has measured their power and decided whether she should seduce
 them, remain hidden, seize their magic while they sleep, or simply 
attack and win another meal. Rotting dragonflesh is her favorite food, 
usually gained by devouring adventurer or weather-weakened dragons. She 
has no taste for fair and open battles. Wyverns are her next favorite 
fare, followed by humans.</p>
<p align="left">Nurvureem is lonely, probably less than sane, and 
unrepentantly evil, openly delighting in theft and cruel pranks. She 
finds amusement in plots against her -- save for those launched by 
dragons, which arouse her to seething anger -- and regards adventurers' 
strivings as her personal entertainment. She often spies on adventuring 
bands to enjoy "the show" (and dine on whatever they slay). She despises
 and destroys dracoliches and members of the Cult of the Dragon on sight
 but doesn't bother pursuing them. She hates other drow, shuns drow 
company, ways, and faiths, and is both fascinated by and fearful of 
other sorts of elves. Elves who treat her arrogantly never fail to 
enrage her, but she has tasted too many traps to let anger goad her into
 instant attack.</p>
<p align="left">Nurvureem's "chosen ground" is the Dessarin valley south
 of Triboar, the lower Delimbiyr as far east as Secomber, and the 
coastal lands south of that to the Way Inn. She knows every ravine and 
nameless creek in this territory but does not bother to patrol or defend
 it as a formal domain.</p>

<p align="left">(The Wyrm Who Watches, The Guardian of the Silmerhelves)</p>
<p align="left">A kindly male bronze ancient dragon now sleepy with age,
 Nymmurh has devoted much of his life to watching over the Silmerhelve 
human noble family of Waterdeep. He crafted several magic mirrors and 
portraits in their homes to serve as constant scrying portals that he 
can see, hear, and speak through at will (remaining hidden unless he 
desires otherwise). These portals entertain Nymmurh as the Silmerhelves 
live out their lives under his scrutiny. He reveals himself to at least 
one family member of each generation so as to advise the clan, and he 
has become a family legend.</p>
<p align="left">More than once he has covertly arranged matches for 
Silmerhelves. He regards the family as under his protection but does not
 watch over every young wayward member and doesn't hold himself 
responsible for the survival and successes of individuals. If the family
 ever faces extinction, he'll kidnap and hide Silmerhelves to continue 
the family line while he makes things safe in Waterdeep for their 
eventual return.</p>
<p align="left">Nymmurh can scry all of his portals constantly and 
adjust their magic to allow him, another creature, or items to travel 
through them in either direction. Whimsical, good-natured, and curious, 
Nymmurh desires to learn more about humankind because he sees them as 
the "great shaping force" destined to rule over or influence all of 
Faerûn during his lifetime.</p>
<p align="left">He views dragons much as humans: potentially dangerous 
sources of entertainment about which it is prudent to learn all he can. 
Nymmurh tries to hide his existence from other dragons as much as 
possible, swooping down to feed by night, and almost never venturing out
 of his lair in dragon form.</p>
<p align="left">Nymmurh has a need to constantly learn more about Toril.
 He likes to guess what lies ahead in politics, trade, and technology, 
finding it all very entertaining. He has no desire to rule and finds no 
joy in outwitting or trapping others, preferring to watch from the 
background unnoticed -- and unattacked.</p>
<p align="left">Nymmurh lairs in the peaks of Alaron in the Moonshaes, 
in the Pit, a chain of caverns heaped with odd items of all sorts; he's 
an incurable collector of souvenirs. Nymmurh ignores the concept of 
domains, cheerfully roaming the North (the Sword Coast and near offshore
 isles in particular) heedless of what dragons dwell where. The only 
areas he'll defend against intruders are his own lair and a larder 
island he has established in the Korinn Archipelago.</p>

<p align="left">(The Minstrel Wyrm)</p>
<p align="left">A very old male blue dragon who dwells in Mount Araddyn 
(just north of Mount Sar along the Coast Road), Olothontor loves music. 
For about a fifth of each year, Harpers and other bards stay at his 
lair, which he rarely leaves, on promised "return visits" (some have 
been making annual appearances for nigh twenty years). These visits 
seldom overlap; the Minstrel Wyrm prefers to host one intruder at a 
time.</p>
<p align="left">The front of Olothontor's lair is a crumbling old stone 
mansion built by titans (hence, large enough for the dragon) and 
enspelled by him so that entry into rooms causes favorite songs to be 
heard. These magical "recordings" warn Olothontor of intrusion and awe 
timid intruders into flight from this "haunted" place. Especially 
accomplished or promising guests are almost pleaded with to stay and 
lift the dragon's loneliness with music, but the hostile or tuneless 
feel the dragon's spells or breath weapon forthwith.</p>
<p align="left">When Olothontor does take wing, he can be found anywhere
 between Mintarn and Anauroch, Neverwinter and Silverymoon, and 
occasionally as far south as Tethyr -- wherever he can hear music. 
Olothontor is aware that other dragons regard certain areas as their 
personal domains and flies high (or very low to the ground) to avoid 
attracting attention to himself -- but that's his habit anyway. He 
regards an attempt by another dragon to dwell or habitually perch on 
Mount Araddyn as an invasion of his own domain and ferociously battles 
any wyrm foolish enough to lair nearby. Olothontor just wants to be left
 alone by other dragons, orc hordes, adventurers, and anyone else who 
does not love music.</p>

<p align="left">(The Unseen Protector, The Sun Dragon)</p>
<p align="left">Mature when Netheril was young, this male gold great 
wyrm prolonged his existence beyond natural death and decay through 
powerful magic, but the spells that maintain his magically knit form are
 now failing, and he dares materialize for only minutes per day -- 
usually for scant seconds, to proffer or snatch something . . . or 
attack.</p>
<p align="left">In solid form, Palarandusk appears as a fierce gold 
dragon whose jaws are white with age, whose scales are cracked and pale,
 and who weeps when he must slay -- but slays nonetheless, without 
hesitation or mercy. His mastery of magic and spell roster is that of a 
28th-level sorcerer, and he employs many spells forgotten today. The 
rest of the time, Palarandusk exists as an invisible entity who can 
watch, listen, speak, and move about, but can't make physical attacks or
 cast spells (except those that affect only himself). In his invisible, 
semisolid form, Palarandusk doesn't age, the spells that maintain him 
don't deteriorate further, and he suffers no harm from the elements.</p>
<p align="left">Palarandusk is now the guardian of Ieirithymbul, a tiny 
mining village of gnomes in the valley of Felrenden (in the westernmost 
Sword Mountains, not far from the High Road southeast of Leilon). He 
regards the gnomes as his children and watches over them as their 
"Unseen Protector." He chafes in his decline, however, and dreams of 
once more being a widely respected power in the Sword Coast North (he 
once was, as "the Sun Dragon," protector of Neverwinter).</p>
<p align="left">Enslaved by a Netherese sorcerer who altered his 
longevity and eventually his nature and abilities, Palarandusk 
flourished for centuries before his powers began to fail, and fear of 
the rising Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan drove him to "disappear." He 
studied magic, hiding in human form, for decades before being attacked 
by adventurers -- and was so ravaged in that battle that his body was 
only held together by "a webwork of shattered spells." He rebuilt his 
frame into the slowly crumbling Unseen Protector he is today.</p>
<p align="left">Palarandusk's body has continued to deteriorate despite 
several magical augmentations. He has recently learned much about 
current trade alliances and practices along the High Road and remains 
alert for news of doings elsewhere in the North (that may in time affect
 the valley he guards).</p>
<p align="left">The aging gold wyrm possesses a thorough, sympathetic 
understanding of human and gnome nature. He believes dragons have a duty
 to live in harmony with the land, devouring prey only as needful, 
despoiling things only when ruination can't be avoided, and protecting 
their domains against damage from floods, fires, and invasions.</p>
<p align="left">The Unseen Protector drifts from one gnome to another 
like an anxious but silent invisible sheepdog, trying to maintain an 
overall, ongoing picture of the whereabouts and doings of all Ieirithyn 
gnomes. He defends them without thought for his own safety, never 
employing traps or ruses and never sleeping. As he works, he's always 
contemplating ways in which his body can be magically strengthened.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20031119a">Raulothim</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Silent Shadow, The Wyrm of Axard)</p>
<p align="left">This gigantic male emerald great wyrm won his more 
famous nickname for his habit of flying over almost every important 
event in the Sword Coast North a century ago, watching and never 
speaking. There was much speculation as to what mysterious master he 
served, but the truth was simply that Raulothim liked gliding on high 
winds and being a part of everything.</p>
<p align="left">Now, however, a mature Raulothim spends long days lying 
motionless, gazing out over the North from his lair in the Pit of Stars,
 a volcanic cauldron on Axard, the northeasternmost isle of Ruathym. The
 sight of a spelljamming ship and the opening of a <i>portal</i> to 
another plane frightened him deeply: How many realms unknown to him 
exist? Who watches Toril from them, and what are their aims? Raulothim 
broods . . . whenever he's not building his magical might for the day 
when someone from otherwhere who thinks he knows too much will come to 
slay him.</p>
<p align="left">The Silent Shadow gains magic by plundering ruins and 
tombs, tearing apart the towers of wounded or absent wizards, and 
seizing or buying magic from adventurers. He largely ignores domains 
(though he defends Axard as one), considering himself free to roam all 
Toril. Well aware of other dragons' territorial claims, he escapes their
 notice entirely by never intruding needlessly into their territories.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20031217a">Saryndalaghlothtor</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Lady Gemcloak, The Axemother)</p>
<p align="left">This adult female crystal dragon makes her lair in a 
cave in the Crags, overlooking Mirabar. A recent arrival in the North, 
she has taken over a rich gem mine developed by the Kreeth goblin tribe 
(whom she exterminated) and spends much time in its depths, devouring 
the exposed ores.</p>
<p align="left">Certain bold dwarves approached her to gain permission 
to mine in her lair and have struck a bargain: They're free to mine, 
defend her lair against intruders, and even to dwell in certain of its 
reaches, in return for feeding her all the gems and metals she desires. 
She's quite happy to eat flawed and shattered gems, low-grade metal 
ores, and rust scraps, and she has come to trust the dwarves -- who in 
turn see her as the "mother" under whose protection they can found a new
 city or tribe.</p>
<p align="left">She considers a very small area (Mirabar and a small 
stretch of the Crags) her domain but defends it fiercely. Other dragons,
 predators of all sorts (including greedy humans), and anyone the 
dwarves don't want around is considered unwanted and dealt with 
accordingly. Lady Gemcloak reportedly has a vicious streak in battle and
 loves maiming and spectacularly slaying foes. (Dismemberments and 
crushings are favorites.)</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20031231a">Thalagyrt</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(Old Lord Memory)</p>
<p align="left">This very old male mist dragon lairs in a damp, dripping
 cliff-face cavern on the shore of the Sea of Swords, north of Port 
Llast. He keeps to himself as much as possible, and many folk who dwell 
nearby don't know he exists at all. His hobby is collecting and 
remembering arcane lore valued by the intelligent races who dwell in the
 North (such as singular items of treasure and magic items), but one 
must trade information to gain desired information out of him, 
overcoming his distaste for being disturbed at all.</p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt can employ his own spells to project (as 
three-dimensional images) scenes that live in his memory -- and his mind
 holds thousands upon thousands of such memories, some of them 
surprisingly important or private moments to humans, elves, or other 
civilized folk. (He has made a career of collecting mind-images from 
dying folk and others who desire to preserve recollections of events.)</p>
<p align="left">A visitor who persuades (usually by payment of large 
amounts of gold coins) Old Lord Memory, for example, can see and hear 
the confrontation in the throne room in Suzail where the risen Azoun 
confronted the traitors who sought to murder him . . . or a tender, 
murmuring love-meeting between the great mages Elminster and the Simbul,
 Witch-Queen of Aglarond. These are but two examples of literally 
thousands of scenes, some of them crucial to an understanding of 
now-crumbling treaties and long-dead heroes, rulers, and villains.</p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt ignores the draconic concept of domains and 
avoids fighting any other wyrms he meets. "Just leave me alone" might 
well be his watchphrase. This means he's timid, but not craven. If 
forced to fight, he will, and he reportedly can call (from afar, by 
magic) on swift and powerful aid from the Chosen, the Heralds, Malchor 
Harpell, and others who value the lore he preserves.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20040128a">Tostyn Alaerthmaugh</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Silver Flame)</p>
<p align="left">This proud, reckless young adult male mercury dragon is 
swiftly rising to prominence in the daily news of the North, because he 
wants to be "in" at the heart of everything important that occurs. 
Hot-tempered and yet gallant and changeable in his likes and dislikes, 
Tostyn is lighthearted and enthusiastic by nature and spends his time 
dashing about, swooping down to make attacks or low rolls from the air. 
He lairs in the depths of the Everlake, at the heart of the Evermoors, 
but spends little time "at home."</p>
<p align="left">Tostyn made his lair where he discovered an invisible 
column of air that keeps the water out of an underground mansion 
(probably once the abode of a powerful wizard). Now it houses his 
collection of magical or simply valuable automata, vessels, and 
oddities. Its owner is more often to be found somewhere near Waterdeep, 
rushing about "being a part of things." Until spells were mustered to 
drive him off, he made quite a habit of "crashing" the country parties 
of Waterdhavian nobles. Domains mean nothing to him -- but he is just 
thoughtful enough to avoid blundering into the faces of larger, older 
dragons. He hates no one until he is crossed with vicious or cruel acts;
 opponents who "play by the rules" are respected. He disdains beings who
 use poisons or magical deception, but he is essentially lighthearted 
and lives for the moment; grudges and feuds aren't for him.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20040225a">Valamaradace</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Dragon Queen of Silverymoon)</p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen is an ancient female gold dragon seldom
 seen by humans except as Targarda, an agile, diminutive female human 
possessed of "elven" looks (her favored form when on rare forays into 
civilized places).</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace dwells with her consort, the adult male 
silver dragon Deszeldaryndun Silverwing, in the Floating Mountain, a 
gigantic, hollow oval rock kept aloft by her spells (which also enshroud
 it in mists and direct it wherever she desires). Usually it hovers low 
over the woods due west of Everlund, or south of there on the verges of 
the High Forest. The draconic couple refers to it as "Softwing." 
Valamaradace determines the boundaries of their shared domain (detailed 
under Deszeldaryndun's entry). She concerns herself with patrolling its 
borders and planning how best to tend its growing things, rather as a 
diligent human minds a prized garden. Her consort deals with intruders 
and "civilized"' beings within the territory, whereas Valamaradace sees 
to removing diseased trees and plants, planting new ones, balancing 
light and shade, marsh and dry land, and so on to create as lush and 
stable a land of plenty as she can. She is constantly busy "adjusting 
the balance" of living things and refining her spells to give her 
greater control over the domain -- and sharper weapons in battle.</p>
<p align="left">Neutral-aligned beings are tolerated as travelers in her
 territory, but not as settlers; evil beings are destroyed or driven out
 upon detection (which has led some good-aligned beings and Harpers to 
describe the domain as "the Haven").</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace is gentle and soft-spoken; she rebukes 
pride and arrogance whenever she encounters it -- and has found that 
many good creatures show all too much of such vices to the world. She 
uses gifts given to her for the benefit of all, so that none might go 
hungry or needy in the Haven. Creatures who take advantage of this 
policy to laze away their days here expecting free food and handouts are
 visited by superiors, creditors, or others (sent by the Dragon Queen) 
to be "set back to their destined tasks."</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20040310a">Voaraghamanthar</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Mere Wyrm, The Black Death)</p>
<p align="left">In the heart of the Mere of Dead Men, the vast coastal 
swamp between Leilon and Waterdeep, dwells the black dragon 
Voaraghamanthar. This marauder of the swamp avoids other dragons who 
intrude into the Mere or claim it as part of their domain and is said to
 have strange powers -- able to emerge suddenly from beneath long-placid
 swamp waters; read and reason as intelligently, patiently, and humbly 
as a timid human scholar; and to be in two places at once.</p>
<p align="left">That latter power is due to the true nature of the wyrm:
 "Voaraghamanthar" is really two identical twin adult male black dragons
 who pose as one dragon in their dealings with intruders into the Mere 
and with members of the Cult of the Dragon. Their true names are 
Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor, but they call each other by the 
short-names Weszlum and Welzour -- that is, when they need to speak at 
all. The twins share an empathic link and work together with no trace of
 jealousy. They are thought to be seeking immortality (as all dragons 
are) -- hence their dealings with the Cult. The Followers of the Scaly 
Way have thus far been unable to convince Voaraghamanthar to seek 
anything more than full and exhaustive details of dracolichdom.</p>
<p align="left">They also seem to be interested in the treasures that 
might lie beneath the inky waters of the Mere (relics of earlier human 
realms) and in lurking underwater or otherwise lying low when other 
dragons are near -- not, it appears, out of fear, but because they've no
 interest in disputes with other dragons.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20040421a">Zundaerazylym</a></b></p>
<p align="left">(The Laughing Wyrm)</p>
<p align="left">This ancient female steel dragon has no real domain but 
considers the city of Neverwinter her territory, defending it against 
other dragons who dare show themselves or try to dominate its 
inhabitants. Battle so excites her that she chortles and hoots almost 
constantly; hence, her nickname.</p>
<p align="left">Zundaerazylym has dwelt "in hiding" in Neverwinter for 
years, taking dragon form only to fight off a raiding mage of the 
Brotherhood of the Arcane and to devour a pair of wyverns who laired too
 near in the Crags. The Laughing Wyrm poses as Amundra Nelaerdra, a 
jolly, plump, gossiping laundress and seamstress. More than once, the 
"Laughing Laundress of Neverwinter" has smuggled embarrassed guests out 
of the Mask, a notorious festhall, in gigantic baskets of laundry, 
allowing them to avoid confrontations with rivals, spouses, superiors, 
or admirers. The steel dragon has an understanding with the owner of the
 Mask, the spellcaster Ophala Cheldarstorn, who sometimes aids 
Zundaerazylym with her spells.</p>
<p align="left">Zundaerazylym likes adventurers, is wary of wizards she 
doesn't know, and dislikes tyrants of all sorts, from children lording 
over other urchins in alleys to kings who mistreat their subjects or try
 to conquer new territory; more than once she's taught sailors from 
Luskan and overblown adventurer-wizards a lesson -- usually luring them 
into private places by posing as a flirtatious tavern wench, then 
changing to dragon form with clashing jaws and wild laughter. Usually 
she lets those she has thus terrified flee unscathed, but she has been 
known to tear a mage's staff, cloak, and garments all away, or break a 
sailor's swordarm and the sword with it.</p>
