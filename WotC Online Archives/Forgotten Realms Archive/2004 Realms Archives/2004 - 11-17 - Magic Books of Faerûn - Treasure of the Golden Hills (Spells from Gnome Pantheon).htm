<p align="left"><i>Bound in sturdy brown leather, this small book's 
cover bears a drawing (inlaid in gold) of a cluster of small hills 
dotted with trees. Underneath the picture is one line of Dethek runes, 
also gold-inlaid, which is repeated in smaller form on the spine. The 
pages are vellum but unadorned. The book smells of old dry leaves, 
though it is not an unpleasant aroma.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Last Record:</b> Valem, troll priest, 13 Alturiak, 1373 DR.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Description:</b> This book is approximately the same 
size as a gnome spellbook. The gold-inlaid drawing on the cover features
 a group of small hills dotted with trees. Any character with a gnome 
patron deity recognizes the drawing as a representation of the Golden 
Hills, the plane where the gnome pantheon resides; other characters may 
attempt DC 15 Knowledge (the planes) or Knowledge (religion) checks to 
recognize the symbol. The lines of gold-inlaid Dethek runes on the cover
 and spine are the title, <i>Treasure of the Golden Hills,</i> written in Gnome. The cover bears no other adornment. The pages are simple but high-quality vellum. The cover page says "<i>Treasure of the Golden Hills</i>
 -- Anecdotes of the Lords of the Golden Hills, and magic pertaining to 
their stories and worship." The cover and interior pages are lettered in
 a fanciful but readable script (in Gnome). Small illustrations of the 
gnome gods adorn these pages, acting out the events of their stories or 
illustrating the use of the spells described in the book.</p>
<p align="left">The book is slightly worn but seems much older than it 
appears, as if it has been passed from gnome to gnome over several 
centuries and always treated with care and respect, though it is a bit 
battered from recent use.</p>
<p align="left"><b>History:</b> This is one of at least four copies of 
this book, all written long ago by a gnome religious scholar who wanted a
 way to introduce gnome religion to younger gnomes in the hopes of 
inspiring more of them to become priests. Most copies of <i>Treasure of the Golden Hills</i>
 have never been out of gnome hands, since gnome communities value them 
highly as historical and religious documents. The one copy that has 
popped up from time to time can be traced back to a clan from the 
southern Far Hills, which was driven out of their home in 1305 DR by a 
young red dragon and his pack of kobold fighters (all bound to him with 
magic and an oath sworn on the dragon's own blood that gave them strange
 powers). One of the fleeing gnome priests took the book with him in the
 wake of the clanhome's destruction; unfortunately his small group was 
overtaken by raiding bugbears, who brought the gnomes back to eat at the
 raiders' cave lair. Lacking a cleric or even an adept, the bugbears 
tossed the book into a pile of debris and forgot about it. Years later 
when the raiders had gained enough allies to be particularly 
troublesome, a group of Neverwinter mercenaries called the Iron Crows 
wiped out the bugbears. The mercenaries found the book, threw it in with
 the rest of the bugbear treasure, and went to Baldur's Gate to 
celebrate their victory. Thick-headed with too much ale, they agreed to 
take on a job from a mysterious merchant (now believed, after several 
divinations, to be an agent of the Red Wizards) who sent them into the 
Troll Hills, which is the last anyone ever heard of them.</p>
<p align="left">In 1370 DR, a gnome priest of Gaerdal Ironhand (and 
descendant of the clan driven out by the dragon 65 years before) named 
Dorgannan Blackwood discovered via magic that the missing book was in 
the hands of a troll living in the Troll Hills. Gleeful at the prospect 
of returning the book to his people after decades of being lost, he 
recklessly started off on his own, pausing only to inform some of his 
friends of the general nature of his quest and that it was important to 
gnomes as a whole. That was the last time he was ever seen alive. 
Recently his friends raised enough money to purchase a minor divination 
and verify that he was in fact dead, and the creature responsible for 
his death is a troll named Valem. The Red Stallion adventuring company 
from Baldur's Gate went into the Troll Hills with a dozen cattle and 
parleyed with the first group of hungry trolls who attacked. The trolls,
 momentarily sated by the meal of easy beef, said they knew of a troll 
priest named Valem from a differing tribe, but the last they had heard 
he had gone north into the Trollbark Forest for some unknown reason. The
 adventurers left before the trolls grew hungry again and are currently 
debating whether they wish to brave the Trollbark Forest in search of 
this strange troll and the treasure he almost certainly carried.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Contents:</b> Each spell in <i>Treasure of the Golden Hills</i>
 is prefaced with a short story about one or more of the gnome gods, 
which serves as a teaching tool for the gnome faith. Each story takes 
4-6 pages. Those stories plus the 14 pages of actual spells in the book 
and the title page mean the book is 86 pages long.</p>
<p align="left">The 14 spell pages describe seven divine spells 
originating from or particularly relevant to the gnome pantheon. These 
spells are considered unusual spells, and any spellcaster who wishes to 
use them must first decipher them as described in the Divine Magical 
Writings section of Chapter 10: Magic of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. 
Some of the spells have different versions for clerics, druids, or even 
rangers, but the differences to each type of caster are explained within
 the spell, taking up no extra space.</p>
<p align="left">The spells in the book are scribed in order of the name 
of the story pertaining to that spell."Baravan and Chiktikka Escape the 
Orc Army," <i>lesser tree healing</i> (new spell, see below)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Callarduran and the Sneaky Thief," <i>stalactite trap</i> (new spell, see below)</li>
<li>"Gaerdal and the Kobold Spy," <i>deafening clang</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>)</li>
<li>"Garl and Arumdina Teach Kurtulmak a Lesson," <i>weapon of the deity</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>)</li>
<li>"How Flandal Invented Smithing," <i>steelskin</i> (a variant form of the <i>silverbeard</i> paladin spell from <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>, giving the caster metallic skin instead of a metallic beard)</li>
<li>"How Segojan Helped Mrs. Badger," <i>burrow</i> (<i>Races of Faerûn</i>, cleric version only)</li>
<li>"Segojan's Clever Defense," <i>Segojan's armor</i> (new spell, see below)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">At least one copy of this book is rumored to have been 
made by a cleric of Urdlen (presumably copied from one of the original 
versions). It supposedly contains an additional spell called <i>blood frenzy</i>,
 which causes the caster to enter a berserk state similar to that of 
barbarian rage and gives them the ferocity ability (they fight without 
penalty while disabled or dying). The rumors do not say if the spell is 
prefixed with a story.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Segojan's Armor<br></b>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Cleric 1, Druid 1, Ranger 1<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M, DF<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Effect:</b> One suit of armor for a Medium or smaller creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">You fabricate a suit of armor from natural materials 
that is suitable for a creature of Medium or smaller size (you determine
 the armor's size at the time of casting, and it cannot change after 
that). The armor is equivalent to leather except that it grants a +4 
armor bonus. That is, it has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +6, an armor 
check penalty of 0, and an arcane spell failure chance of 10%. It weighs
 as much as leather armor of similar size weighs (for example, 15 pounds
 if the armor is made for a Medium creature). The armor has a trace 
amount of metal in it (see material components section); however a druid
 can wear it without penalty.</p>
<p align="left">When the spell ends, the armor falls apart, breaking 
back into the materials from which you made it. The armor's remains 
cannot be reused for another spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component:</i> A handful of grass, a handful of roots, and a pinch of powdered iron.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stalactite Trap<br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Cleric 1, Druid 1<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Target:</b> One Small stalactite<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level or until triggered<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates (object)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (object)</p>
<p align="left">You imbue one stalactite with limited mobility and 
sentience. The stalactite remains in place until an enemy creature moves
 beneath it, at which point it hurls itself at that creature as a touch 
attack (attack bonus equals your base attack bonus). If it hits, it 
deals 2d6 points of piercing damage plus 1d6 for every 30 feet the 
stalactite falls beyond 30 feet (+1d6 for 60 feet, +2d6 for 90 feet, and
 so on). The spell ends when the stalactite makes its attack; if no 
enemy passes underneath before the spell ends, the stalactite remains 
attached.</p>
<p align="left">If cast on a stalactite currently positioned over an 
enemy, the spell causes the stalactite to immediately make an attack on 
that enemy.</p>
<p align="left">This spell was developed by the priests of Callarduran Smoothhands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tree Healing, Lesser<br></b>Conjuration (Healing)<br><b>Level:</b> Cleric 4, Druid 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">You enter a normal tree, which must be large enough to 
accommodate your body in all three dimensions. You can remain hidden 
within it for as long as you desire, up to 1 hour/level. While you 
remain inside it, the tree nourishes and heals you. You have no need to 
breathe or eat, and you regain 5 hit points for each hour spent in the 
tree. The tree also grants you total cover and concealment and protects 
you from extreme heat or cold, rain, sunlight, snow, and all other 
environmental conditions. You can hear but not see what occurs outside 
the tree. Minor physical damage to the tree does not harm you, but its 
partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) 
expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. If the tree is totally 
destroyed (by a forest fire or a <i>blight</i> spell, for example), you are expelled from the tree and instantly slain unless you succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save.</p>
<p align="left">This spell was developed by the priests of Baervan Wildwanderer, who call it <i>tree nap</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Price:</b> 700 gp (spellbook value only). As a 
collection of gnome religious stories, it is worth 100 gp to a collector
 of such things. A gnome aware of the item's historical and religious 
significance -- which is any gnome cleric or druid and any other gnome 
who succeeds at a DC 15 Knowledge (history) or Knowledge (religion) 
check -- knows gnome clans or churches are willing to pay 1,000 gp or 
more just for its nonspellbook value, or up to 2,000 gp in magical or 
crafting services (such as spellcasting, providing masterwork armor or 
weapons, and so on), plus the value of the spells if they can use them. 
Anyone who returns the book to such a group is likely to receive honors 
or some other form of reward in addition to monetary or material 
compensation.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Last Known Bearer:</b> Valem, troll priest of Talona</p>
<p align="left">Valem was a hardy but otherwise unexceptional troll 
living with his tribe in the Troll Hills. A raid by a rival tribe drove 
his tribe into a part of the hills that had already been depleted of 
game. All his people could find were the rotting carcasses abandoned by 
another group of trolls who were scared off by a wild magic effect. 
Valem's tribe ate the rotting meat, and one by one they succumbed to 
horrible stomach pains and a wasting disease that interfered with their 
natural ability to regenerate. Only Valem was unaffected, and eventually
 he ate his own dead and dying tribemates. Alone and starving, he 
wandered in a delirium and received a vision from Talona, who appeared 
to him in troll-shape and said she had picked him to be her speaker 
among the trolls, that the troll gifts of strength, hardiness, and rapid
 healing were from her many generations ago but forgotten after a battle
 between her and Vaprak, god of trolls (lies, but a believable lie to a 
dumb troll).</p>
<p align="left">She awakened parts of his mind, taught him the rudiments
 of her religion, and turned him loose to teach other trolls about the 
Talonite faith (more as an experiment than anything with a real hope of 
success, though if it annoys Vaprak, it's enough for her). So far he has
 met with little success; most trolls care little for religion as it 
doesn't fill their bellies, and those tribes with an adept are resistant
 to changing their religion. Valem has been spreading disease among 
these tribes, planning to return later to cure them and show Talona's 
power. As disease follows in the wake of his failures to convert the 
tribes, other trolls are starting to see him as bad luck. Recently he 
turned northward to the Trollbark Forest, hoping to find others more 
accepting of his teachings.</p>
<p align="left">Valem has the missing gnome book. Dorgannan Blackwood 
found the tribe that had the book (as with the bugbears, it was 
discarded in a pile of refuse), sneaked into their lair, and stole it 
without them noticing, only to run into Valem an hour later while trying
 to get out of the hills. Valem, on his way to the recently thieved 
tribe to preach, attacked the tasty-looking gnome; Dorgannan was no 
match for the troll and was killed and eaten. Valem can't read the book 
(he can't read at all, despite having levels in the cleric class) but 
keeps it because he likes the pictures and carries it in a sack with his
 other valuables.</p>

damage to Valem. If Valem loses a limb or body part, the lost portion 
regrows in 3d6 minutes. He can reattach the severed member instantly by 
holding it to the stump.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Cleric Spells Prepared</i> (caster level 5th): 0 -- <i>create water</i> (5); 1st -- <i>command</i> (4, DC 12), <i>protection from good</i>[D]; 2nd -- <i>resist energy</i> (2), <i>shatter</i>[D]; 3rd -- <i>contagion</i>[D] (DC 14), <i>cure serious wounds.</i></p>
<p align="left">[D] Domain spell. Domains: Destruction (smite 1/day, +4 
on attack, extra 5 points of damage), Evil (cast evil spells at +1 
caster level).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Possessions:</i><i>+1 chainmail</i>, <i>ring of protection +1</i>, 300 gp worth of assorted coins, gems, and small valuables. <i>Tactics:</i>
 Valem has learned from experience that adventurers usually bring fire, 
so if he hears or scents humanoids in the area, he casts <i>resist energy</i>
 (fire) on himself and tries to find a way to attack from hiding or at 
least in a place where his enemies can't shoot at him many times while 
he closes for melee.</p>
<p align="left">NOTE: Valem's CR is lower than normal for a creature of 
his race and class, since his low Intelligence prevents him from 
utilizing his spells in the most effective manner and he has less gear 
than normal. At the same time, cleric is a nonassociated class for a 
troll, which also affects the CR.</p>
