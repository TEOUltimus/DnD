<p align="LEFT">In the heart of the Mere of Dead Men, the vast saltwater
 swamp that lies along the Sword Coast between Leilon and Waterdeep, 
dwells the savage black dragon Voaraghamanthar, the "Black Death." This 
wyrm is said to have strange powers and avoids other dragons who intrude
 into the swamp or claim it as part of their domain. Most tales say the 
Black Death can burst from beneath long-placid swamp waters, read and 
reason intelligently, and be in two places at once. </p>
<p align="LEFT">This latter power is due to the true nature of this 
dragon: "Voaraghamanthar" is, in fact, two identical twin, adult male, 
black dragons who pose as one dragon in their dealings with both 
intruders and allies, the latter of which includes a Cult of the Dragon 
cell based in Leilon. Their actual names are Voaraghamanthar and 
Waervaerendor (who impishly styles himself "the Rapacious Raider), but 
they address each other by the short-names "Weszlum" and "Wulzour," 
respectively, when they speak at all. The twins share an empathic link 
and work together with unshakable loyalty.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Faerûn, however, knows of only one deadly, legendary 
Wyrm of the Mere: a flitting black ghost of claws and jaws that strikes 
out of nowhere. The black swamp waters hide the dragons and the rotting 
bodies of victims they wait to dine upon -- or keep prisoner, helpless 
in the cold muck, for fell purposes. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Mere of Dead Men </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Twisted trees, vines, and thick vegetation cloak the 
mist-shrouded surface of the cold saltwater swamp. Its air is foul with 
rotting stenches, and its water is black and opaque. Visibility, given 
fogs and rolling topography, is rarely more than half a mile. </p>
<p align="LEFT">For flightless creatures, travel in the Mere is slow and
 dangerous. Its dark waters are deep enough to permit a flat-bottomed 
skiff to pass, but many small islands rise from the swamp islands 
tangled with strange vegetation. The overgrown bones of long-fallen 
creatures lie everywhere. Quicksand is rare but mud all too common. 
Given the thick growth and frequent need to wade (and flounder), 
skiff-borne travelers can cover about eight miles in 10 hours. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Mere of Dead Men is known for its monstrous 
denizens. Travelers on the High Road skirting its eastern verges often 
travel for three days and nights without stopping, to avoid camping 
within reach of "dark, wet, clutching things raiding out of the swamp." 
Bobbing will-o'-wisps are common night sights from the road. Sword Coast
 lore speaks vividly of floating islands moving in the Mere, lizardfolk 
commanded by liches, a penanggalan of monstrous size, drowned ships 
swarming with sea zombies, gigantic darktentacles, yuan-ti slavers, 
temples to inhuman gods, giant leeches with bullywug riders, a huge 
will-o'-wisp that pulses with dark energy, and many other horrors. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Monsters proven (by adventurers' kills) to dwell in the Mere include aballins, behirs, bullywugs, flying fangs (see <i>Races of Faerûn</i>),
 giant frogs and toads, gibbering mouthers, giant leeches, hydras, 
lizardfolk, meazels, monitor lizards, nyths, scrags (aquatic trolls), 
shambling mounds, snakes, and will-o'-wisps. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The taint of the dead god Myrkul's power in recent 
history animated many of the dead drowned beneath the western Mere, 
creating a profusion of strange undead and many sorts of ghouls, 
skeletons, and zombies now found in groups wandering the swamp and the 
lands around, attacking everyone they encounter.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mere History </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the Year of the Shattered Scepter (614 DR), orc 
hordes attacked the realm of Phalorm and defeated its armies. A year 
later, the orcs besieged a rallied remnant of Phloem's defenders at 
Iniarv's Tower, onetime abode of the long-vanished Mage Royal of 
Uthtower. The battle disturbed and enraged Iniarv (who'd become a lich 
and retreated into the tower's crypts).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Iniarv hurled mighty spells against his arousers, but 
the seemingly endless orcs soon invaded long-sheltered Uthtower. A 
desperate King Uth VII beseeched the lich to honor his ancient alliance 
with Uthtower and destroy the invading orcs. With cruel humor, Iniarv 
honored the request by unleashing titanic spells that caused the ocean 
to rise and inundate the land, drowning humans and orcs alike. When the 
waters receded, a sprawling saltwater mere lay in place of hitherto 
verdant realms. (Recent scholars believe the Curse of Iniarv was a 
powerful <i>wish</i> that magically bound the eastern border of the Mere to the High Road -- ensuring its expansion whenever the road is rerouted.) </p>
<p align="LEFT">The few human (and human-ally) survivors fled. The orcs 
retreated to the Sword Mountains, where centuries later their 
descendants founded the realm of Uruth Ukrypt. Phalorm soon collapsed 
when the elves of Ardeep withdrew from it, to be replaced in the Year of
 the Ensorceled Kings (616 DR) by Delimbiyran, the Kingdom of Man.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Over the centuries, the Mere of Dead Men grew ever 
larger, inundating all land between the sea and the High Road no matter 
how far the road was moved inland. Attempts to resettle the former 
Uthtower uplands were thwarted by the greedy waters of the Mere time and
 again. Former routes of the High Road are marked by such flooded sites 
as Castle Naerytar, Holk House, Mornhaven Towers, and Wolfhill House.</p>
<p align="LEFT">From its creation, the Mere harbored all manner of 
monsters, both living and undead -- captured beasts and monstrous 
experiments released by Iniarv among them -- and so was largely avoided 
by civilized beings. The first dragon to settle in the Mere was 
Chardansearavitriol, "Ebondeath" to the Fair Folk, an old male black 
dragon who seized the crumbling ruins of the Uthtower and its catacombs 
as his lair in the Year of the Lone Lark (631 DR).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Over the centuries, Chardansearavitriol ruled the Mere, 
preying primarily on Sword Mountain orcs. In the Year of the Spouting 
Fish (922 DR), he vanished, giving rise to tales that he'd died, 
relocated, or withdrawn into seclusion in the heart of the swamp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The dragon had actually heeded the entreaties of 
Strongor Bonebag, a charismatic Priest of Myrkul with ties to the Cult 
of the Dragon, and been transformed into a dracolich. The Cult cell 
headed by Strongor had its own interpretations of the teachings of 
Myrkul and Sammaster; Strongor blended the tenets of both into a dark 
creed that venerated the Sacred Ones as divine servants of the Lord of 
Bones, who would one day undergo apotheosis. There would come a time, 
Strongor preached, when Myrkul would absorb all Toril into his realm. On
 that day, the gods of the living would be swept away by the claws of 
the rightful gods: an ascending pantheon of dracolich powers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To serve the faithful during the long years until 
Myrkul's triumph, the Uthtower (Chardansearavitriol's lair, almost sixty
 miles west of Iniarv's Tower) was transformed into the Mausoleum of the
 Ebondeath, a great temple of stone and scoured bone wherein the 
Ebondeath Sect could dwell while venerating their god-to-be.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Strongor's sudden death less than a decade later ended 
his efforts to extend the sect across the North, but his followers held 
to his teachings. Ebondeath, who cared more for gaining personal power 
than for Strongor's vision, was slavishly served by the cultists (each 
of whom, upon death, was transformed into an undead servitor by his 
fellows). Chardansearavitriol's isolation from wider Faerûn was deepened
 by the emergence of the orc realm of Uruth Ukrypt circa 930 DR and the 
subsequent collapse of trade along the High Road. (The end of the 
dragon's raiding had allowed the orc population to soar and the 
followers of Uruth to establish their own kingdom.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Over time, Ebondeath became mere legend. When Uruth 
Ukrypt fell in the Year of Crimson Magics (1026 DR), his name and deeds 
were largely forgotten. For nearly two centuries Chardansearavitriol 
slumbered in the heart of the Mere, venerated by his cult, rousing 
himself only to defend his domain against intruders. This drowsy 
existence ended abruptly in the Year of the Dragon Altar (1202 DR).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The power of Myrkul, the Lord of Bones, waxes when the 
Eye of Myrkul appears in the night sky. This rare celestial event 
involves the passage of a new moon through a certain ring of seven stars
 otherwise associated with an old symbol of Mystra. Under the Eye's 
baleful glare, Chardansearavitriol's body collapsed into a heap of bones
 and drifting dust atop the altar of Myrkul. (Ebondeath survived as a 
spirit tethered to his physical remains and might linger in that same 
state today.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">The remaining cultists hailed Ebondeath's sudden 
transformation as the long-heralded second stage of divine ascension 
Strongor had foretold. Worshipers of Myrkul flocked to the temple at the
 heart of the Mere, and the Ebondeath Sect grew strong, awaiting the 
night when once again the Eye of Myrkul would grace the sky. Over the 
years, Sect members prepared for the next stage of Chardansearavitriol's
 ascension, in accordance with a series of visions unveiled to their 
highest ranking priests by the Lord of Bones. In particular, the 
cultists worked to create <i>rings of Myrkul</i>, unholy items the Reaper said would be needed in years to come.</p>
<p align="LEFT">However, the Sect collapsed when Myrkul perished in the 
Time of Troubles, and the Mausoleum sank into the swamp. Fleeing 
Myrkulites yielded their lives -- and magic rings -- to the monsters of 
the Mere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Upon Myrkul's death, the god's avatar exploded high 
above the Sea of Swords. Much of his might rained down on the waters to 
slowly collect on the sea floor, and the god's essence survives in the 
Crown of Horns, but a small fraction of the god's power coalesced atop 
the waves. This floating patch of bone dust drifted north, and -- 
perhaps by chance, perhaps by dark design -- recently entered the Mere, 
where Myrkul's fading power animated a leaderless legion of undead from 
the countless fallen bodies that lie unburied beneath the dark waters. 
These "risen dead" displaced many swamp monsters, who've taken to 
raiding the lands around. Some of the "risen" are Myrkulites who fled 
the sinking Mausoleum, and many of the <i>rings of Myrkul</i> they bore have passed into the possession of others.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Those others included the leaders of the Dragon Cult 
cell in Leilon, who remembered legends about the Mausoleum. They 
commanded their agents to search for the sunken temple and its dracolich
 and induced Voaraghamanthar (a black dragon whose settlement in the 
Mere had greatly worried the cultists but who fortunately seemed 
approachable) to assist in the search.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Voaraghamanthar gave his aid in exchange for the promise of much treasure and many magic items, including the <i>Twinned Crown of Yarlith</i>
 (a magic crown created by Iniarv in 191 DR and recently discovered by 
Cult members exploring flooded Mere ruins), which was given to the 
dragon to seal the bargain.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Black Brothers</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Unknown to the Cult, Voaraghamanthar has an identical 
twin, Waervaerendor. The brothers have long pretended to be a single 
being (using only Voaraghamanthar's name in "public"), since this 
deception provides them with a powerful weapon against foes who think 
they face but a single dragon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Black Brothers were born in a large clutch of eggs 
in the Mhair jungles. Draconic twins are rare indeed (one typically 
kills the other in the egg before hatching), but Voaraghamanthar and 
Waervaerendor share an empathic link that bonds them into an unshakable 
team. Together the hatchling twins slew their siblings and fled before 
their parents could in turn destroy them. After many years of lurking in
 swamps and moors throughout Faerûn, the Brothers found a "home" they 
deemed fitting and took the Mere of Dead Men as their domain. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The twins were attracted by its isolation (far from 
traditional black dragon haunts, making lair challengers fewer) and its 
legends of lost magic and treasure: the hoard of Chardansearavitriol and
 the treasuries of flooded Uthtower and other realms. Writings about 
treasures lost in the Mere found in tombs they plundered described the <i>Twin Crowns of Myrmoran</i>,
 reputed to have enhanced the empathic bond between the fraternal 
monarchs of Uthtower and Yarlith and afforded them magical powers. The 
Brothers saw no reason such powers shouldn't benefit them. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The twins have long striven to increase their power by 
acquiring magic, specifically spells leading to a means of creating 
loyal, formidable servitor creatures to serve them as warriors, 
guardians, and drudges. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Like most dragons beyond youth, thoughts of their own 
deaths weigh ever more heavily on the brothers, and they've begun -- 
earlier in life than many wyrms -- to seek immortality energetically. 
They share the fear that the death of one of them might render the other
 insane through their empathic link. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Both brothers see undeath (dracolichdom) as a fool's 
road, doomed to fall shy of immortality and unworthy of consideration. 
Nevertheless, when approached by the Dragon Cult, they forged an 
alliance in hopes of gaining lore amid the details of dracolichdom that 
might provide a means of prolonging their lives and preserving their 
(living, vigorous) bodies. Cultists are also "useful tools" to spy and 
work for the twins outside the Mere. They still pretend to be tempted by
 dracolichdom but are completely insincere about the alliance (and 
suspect the followers of the Scaly Way are no more true). </p>
<p align="LEFT">On their own, the brothers unearthed a collection of 
dark sermons probably written by Strongor Bonebag. Reading these sermons
 (which they've kept secret from the Cult), they've come to believe 
Chardansearavitriol underwent a process different from that which the 
Cult uses to create most dracoliches. They also believe the <i>Twinned Crown of Uthtower</i>, second of the <i>Twin Crowns of Myrmoran</i>,
 still lies in the Uthtower. Once each brother wears a crown, they 
presume, they'll command great powers not evident while they have only 
the Yarlith coronet. Seeking to win both the second crown and 
Ebondeath's bones without damaging their Cult alliance, the Brothers 
hope to sway adventurers entering the Mere into securing both for them. 
Waervaerendor destroyed a Helmite base in ruined Iniarv's Tower and took
 captives; the brothers intend to bargain their lives for the things 
they want retrieved -- before the Dragon Cult recovers these treasures. 
The dragon, calling himself Voaraghamanthar, keeps the Cult's interest 
and his brother's existence secret from adventurers he bargains with.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Encountering the Wyrm of the Mere</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Black Brothers see most creatures as food or 
annoyances to be dealt with efficiently. The exceptions are dragons and 
heroes (whom they view as "tools too useful to be destroyed out of 
hand"). The brothers lurk underwater when other dragons are near -- not 
out of fear but to conceal the fact that they are twins, and because 
they have utterly no interest in disputes with other dragons . . . 
unless they try to settle in the Mere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If heroes approach, Voaraghamanthar typically withdraws,
 alerting his brother. Waervaerendor habitually shadows and observes 
them, remaining hidden thanks to his <i>ring of invisibility</i>. Against large groups or formidable foes, Waervaerendor might also employ <i>dust of disappearance</i> for an opportunity to observe the intruders thoroughly, seeking magic and hidden weapons and abilities.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once future minions or meals are assessed, Waervaerendor
 reveals himself in a manner that terrifies and heightens his 
negotiating advantage. The dragon has a flair for cruel dramatics. If he
 knows intruders have previously triggered an <i>Iniarv's unseen voice</i>
 in the ruins of Iniarv's Tower, he positions himself behind them and 
softly asks (mimicking the lich's voice), "Now where did I hide that 
dragon?" Alternatively, he might circle adventurers on muddy ground, 
creating footprints that appear "out of thin air."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once he has made his presence known, Waervaerendor tries
 to negotiate a deal for the heroes' services. Depending on their 
reactions, he might or might not become visible, calling himself by his 
brother's name to sow confusion. Though not easily provoked, 
Waervaerendor realistically fakes emotional reactions to enhance his 
negotiating position. The Wyrm of the Mere is ever alert for treachery, 
fully expecting others to act as he would and preparing accordingly. He 
is malicious, conniving, and unscrupulous; he employs any tactic that 
gives him an advantage. Voaraghamanthar's disposition is similar, and he
 is always close enough to render aid when needed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If negotiations completely fail to gain him an edge, 
Waervaerendor fights without hesitation, but -- after demonstrating the 
folly of fighting him -- tries to resume negotiations. If adventurers 
don't attack but refuse any deal, the dragon observes aloud that those 
who do not serve him are simply prey, then proceeds to treat them 
accordingly until they are defeated or offer to negotiate.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The brothers' objectives are to induce adventurers to 
find and retrieve treasures: magic items and books of magic outside the 
Mere; valuables submerged in the swamp (magic of the flooded, fallen 
kingdoms in particular); and what the Mausoleum holds -- the bones of 
Chardansearavitriol and Ebondeath's hoard. The dragons avoid explaining 
why they want these things. If pressed for guarantees, Waervaerendor 
gives his word as bond and acts insulted if more is desired. (If 
pressed, he'll swear an oath to do as agreed or forfeit his entire hoard
 to Task, the draconic power of greed and selfishness -- but he will 
expect the adventurers to swear similar behavior -- binding oaths 
invoking their own gods.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">The brothers typically bury creatures slain for food and
 battle captives in the underwater mud at the heart of the Mere, far 
from prying eyes. The former are left to rot (for such is the favorite 
fare of black dragons); the latter are stored for use as decoys and 
bargaining tools. Captives are stripped of magic, armor, and weapons; 
they are bound, forced to ingest <i>air spores</i> (a magic item which grants 2d4 days of breathable air regardless of the surrounding environment), and buried in the muck.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Black Claws Up Close</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Both wyrms are experienced in battle, prefer to study 
opponents beforehand, and like to begin a fray with a clawing, biting 
pounce, thereafter breathing as often as possible, kicking and 
tail-slapping as opportunities arise. Each flees if brought to fewer 
than half hit points. If the other brother is close, either twin tries 
to entice foes into reach of his sibling's breath weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The brothers prefer aquatic combat to aerial or dry-land
 fighting and are well versed in drowning foes by beating opponents down
 into the mire or using grappling to pin opponents under the water. Both
 dragons are also comfortable fighting perched on stony heights, 
employing <i>spider climb</i> when needed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When battling another wyrm in the skies, either brother 
employs his breath weapon to damage a foe's wings, then draws the enemy 
into the nearest swamp or open water. In water, the brothers use wing 
buffets to drive huge sprays of (preferably previously corrupted) water 
at foes. Waervaerendor wears a <i>ring of invisibility</i> and a <i>ring of mind shielding</i>. In a small pouch strapped to his left rear leg he carries three packets of <i>dust of disappearance</i>, six doses of <i>air spores</i>, and a <i>portable hole</i> (used to ferry treasure and prisoners). Voaraghamanthar wears the <i>Twinned Crown of Yarlith</i>. On his left front claw, he wears a <i>ring of wizardry</i> (1st-level spells). On his right front claw is a <i>ring of fire resistance (major)</i>. He habitually casts <i>shield</i> before combat and uses <i>confusion</i> to draw foes from cover.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The brothers resent intrusions into their affairs or 
domain. When they let self-control slip, they fight with unbridled fury.
 Cunning and amoral, they're never needlessly cruel or destructive. 
They've little interest in displays of power or acquiring territory, 
considering discretion the better part of valor and their lives more 
important than victory.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Waervaerendor is more outgoing, preferring to acquire 
information face-to-face, while Voaraghamanthar prefers to study and 
deduce from dusty tomes and ancient ruins. Waervaerendor relishes the 
hunt more than his twin and is more apt to tackle difficult quarry for 
the challenge. Both brothers are practiced actors, can read and reason, 
and thirst for magical knowledge.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, 
Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor can breathe an 80-foot line of acid. 
Each creature in the area takes 12d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 23
 half).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b> Whenever Voaraghamanthar
 or Waervaerendor attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature in a
 180-foot radius that has 18 or fewer HD must make a DC 22 Will save. 
Failure indicates that the creature is panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it 
has 4 or fewer HD) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or more HD).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>darkness.</i> Caster level 12th.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spells:</b> Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor can cast spells as 12th-level sorcerers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> Voaraghamanthar and 
Waervaerendor can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. 
Opponents they can't actually see still have total concealment against 
them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Corrupt Water</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, 
Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water 
within 180 feet, making it become still, foul, and unable to support 
animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Magic items 
(such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a
 DC 22 Will save or become fouled. This ability is the equivalent of a 
1st-level spell. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Voaraghamanthar and 
Waervaerendor can see four times as well as a human in shadowy 
illumination and twice as well in normal light. They also have 
darkvision to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Telepathy (Ex):</b> The dragons can communicate with 
each other within 100 feet using telepathy. In addition, they are 
constantly aware of each other's emotional state through a limited 
empathic form of this telepathy, which works as long as they are on the 
same plane. They've developed enough control to convey simple 
prearranged messages (such as danger, food, treasure, yes, no, come, and
 stay away) by mental "flavor" of these empathic messages.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b> Voaraghamanthar and 
Waervaerendor can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use 
their breath weapons, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/13/7/7/6/5/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 -- <i>dancing lights, daze, detect magic, electric jolt</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>flare, ghost sound, ray of frost, read magic, touch of fatigue;</i> 1st -- <i>charm person, ice dagger</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>shield, summon undead I </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>true strike; </i>2nd -- <i>Aganazzar's scorcher</i> (FRCS), <i>daze monster, death armor </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>eagle's splendor, spider climb; </i>3rd -- <i>dispel magic, fireball, summon undead III</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>vampiric touch;</i> 4th -- <i>backlash</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>confusion, wall of ice;</i> 5th -- <i>shadow hand</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>summon undead V</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>); 6th -- <i>fire spiders</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> Hide, Move Silently, and Swim are 
considered class skills for black dragons. Voaraghamanthar and 
Waervaerendor can move through water at swim speed without making Swim 
checks; they have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some 
special action or avoid a hazard (included), and they always can choose 
to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered, and can 
use the run action while swimming in a straight line.</p>
