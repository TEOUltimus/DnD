<p align="left"><i>This adventure locale is best suited for a plains 
area, such as the Shining Plains or the Greenfields near the Dragon 
Coast, the Ride near the Moonsea, or the Shaar. With suitable 
adjustment, it could be set in a forested area as well. The unique 
nature of the place, however, can follow the heroes around for quite 
some time before they discover the truth and find a way to rid 
themselves of the consequences of spending too much time here. This 
adventure locale is suitable for four 6th-level player characters.</i></p>
<p align="center"><img src="2004%20-%2012-22%20-%20Adventure%20Locales%20-%20The%20Bog_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p align="left">As the road (or path) winds through the grasslands, a 
small house (a mimic) slowly comes into view near the horizon and along 
the road. It is quite alone in this part of the world, but travelers may
 hope it offers some shelter for the night. Those who approach can see 
that the 15-foot-square house stands on short stilts in the middle of a 
shallow bog or heath. The watery grassland stretches some 200 or more 
feet away from the road, and is about 120 feet wide. Tall grasses 
protrude above the water's surface, as do other bushes and a couple of 
small trees. A look into the water from the roadside can reveal turtles,
 snakes, or even a beaver. Wetland birds such as warblers, killdeers, go
 about their business in the area. On the far side a pair of blue herons
 stands in the water. In trees a few hundred feet away one might find 
the nest of some ospreys or hawks. In the late afternoon sunlight it is 
quite peaceful here. Only a closer examination reveals the strangeness 
of the place. Nothing here is quite as it seems. No immediate danger is 
apparent, but that is no true indication of the peril that awaits the 
unwary.</p>
<p align="left">No regularly used campsites are around the edge of this 
bog, and nothing indicates that people stop here. Certainly people 
travel on the road, and sometimes stop to water here, but everyone who 
regularly uses the road knows not to stay here or to be here after dark.</p>
<p align="left">Crossing the bog is easy, since the water is only 3 feet
 deep at its deepest points. The average depth is only 2 feet. The 
animals that make this place their home avoid anything walking through 
the waters. Treat the whole area as a shallow bog; movement through the 
area is hampered and the DC for any Tumble check increases by +2. See 
page 88 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for more information on bogs.</p>
<p align="left">Upon reaching the house, one can see that the roof is 
covered in bird droppings, mute testimony to the time the old house has 
been here. The house seems unoccupied, since no one within answers any 
hails. Though perhaps 50 years or so old, it appears very sturdy. The 
wood may have come from somewhere far away, since it has a reddish hue 
similar to that of a redwood tree, which is not a tree that grows in 
this area. Though the building seems weathered, the red coloration shows
 plainly, as if valiantly resisting the work of time. The door stands 
slightly ajar, and one of the two windows on the front side appears 
open. The other is shuttered. Windows on each side give the owner a view
 of the surrounding bog. One can imagine that this is the home of a 
druid.</p>
<p align="left">In fact, the house is actually a Huge mimic that has 
lived in the bog for decades, slowly changing as a result of its 
exposure to the bog waters. To the casual observer, the mimic looks 
exactly like a small house set on stilts. The windows around the sides 
and back seem to be shuttered. At the front of the house, a shutter and 
the front door seem to be ajar, with only blackness behind them. Both 
window and shutter seem stuck in place -- neither one moves when the 
wind blows.</p>
<p align="left">Characters who examine the house should make Spot checks
 opposed by the mimic's Disguise check to detect what the "house" might 
truly be. Anyone touching the house automatically becomes stuck to the 
mimic and needs a DC 16 Strength check to break free. The mimic also can
 use its slam attack to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_grapplecheck')">grapple</a> foes. Foes grappled after being slammed cannot get free without first neutralizing the adhesive.</p>
<p align="left">The mimic immediately uses its slam attack when anyone 
touches it or prods it with an item. If the foe has not noticed that the
 "house" is really a creature, the mimic surprises the foe. In most 
cases, the mimic slams the foe that touches it, but it's smart enough to
 ignore a fairly weak character who touches it and becomes stuck in 
favor of attacking a more dangerous foe.</p>
<p align="left">The mimic feels a compelling need to remain in the 
waters of the bog, and in any case it cannot flee the faster player 
characters anyway. Thus, it tries to neutralize all attackers (usually 
by rendering them unconscious) before finishing anyone off.</p>
<p align="left">Around the base of the house, buried in the mud of the 
bog floor, the player characters can find a few items left by previous 
victims. These include a <i>+1 greatsword</i> (or other appropriate weapon for your player characters), a suit of masterwork chainmail, 21 gp, and a <i>wand of shield of faith (+2)</i> with 3 charges remaining.</p>
<p align="left">However, the greatest danger facing any explorer of the 
bog is not the mimic, but the bog itself. About 320 of years ago, this 
site was the home of a powerful and mentally unbalanced wizard. He was 
called Hedge in derision by the people who lived close by at the time, 
which only fueled his growing madness. During one horrible experiment, 
something happened that no one understands. The mage's tower was 
obliterated as if it had never existed, and the bog spontaneously 
appeared in its place. Theories abound, but no one can know the truth 
because all records have disappeared along with Hedge himself.</p>
<p align="left">The bog is the physical manifestation of a rupture in 
the Weave. A small amount of magic slowly leaks from the rupture. The 
bog has a faint aura of transmission magic at all times, as do any 
creatures that have been infused with the magic of the place.</p>
<p align="left">Any creature that has been in the waters of the bog 
begins to absorb magic from the site. The amount of magic that can be 
absorbed is finite, but still a body normally cannot hold the raw magic 
of the Weave. After 1 hour in the water, a creature acquires the 
magic-infused creature template described below. </p>
<p align="left">At night, the bog produces magical light effects similar to <i>dancing lights</i>
 spells, and the lights shimmer and dance all across its surface. To 
someone who didn't know about the bog, it appears that a group of 
will-o'-wisps has come out in the darkness to play. The lights never 
approach anyone, but they put on an eerie show all around the watery 
area. The bog doesn't have any intelligence; the light effects are 
random. Though unnerving, they are not harmful to anyone.</p>
<p align="left"><b>New Template: Magic-Infused Creature</b></p>
<p align="left">In some rare places in the world, the magic of the Weave
 leaks out and pools. In these places, living creatures can absorb the 
magic and carry it within them. This changes the creatures in subtle but
 discernible ways. Most creatures that have absorbed magic in this way 
live out the rest of their lives without realizing what has happened and
 with just a few unusual changes that they cannot explain.</p>
<p align="left">"Magic-infused" is an acquired template that can be 
added to any living corporeal creature (hereafter referred to as the 
base creature). A magic-infused creature used the base creature's 
statistics and special abilities, except as noted below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Qualities: </b>A magic-infused creature retains all the base creature's special qualities and gains those described below.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Aura of Magic</i> (Sp): The creature always detects 
as magical under spells that detect the presence of magic. The type of 
magic is transmutation, and the strength is "faint." </p>
<p align="left"><i>Infused with Magic (Ex):</i> The creature's whole 
body is infused with magic, which permeates the creature the same way 
that water does a human. This infused magic never leaves, and it never 
grows in strength unless the creature is further exposed to a source of 
infusing magic. Removing the magic absorbed in this place requires a 
targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell that succeeds against a 24th-level caster, or a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell. </p>
<p align="left">Minor Polymorph<i> (Sp):</i> The infusing magic affects 
the body of the magic-infused creature. Minor changes occur to the 
creature's form that the creature cannot control or remove without 
ridding itself of the infusing magic. These minor appearance-changing 
effects can include horns, a forked tongue, reddish or bluish skin tone 
(or any other color), change in hair color or length, baldness, and the 
sudden appearance of tattoos linked thematically to the creature in some
 way (such as an orc skull with an arrow through it on a ranger whose 
favored enemy is orcs). These changes do not affect class abilities, and
 remain with the creature if it changes its form via <i>polymorph</i> or
 similar magic. Creatures with the shapechanger subtype can revert to 
their true forms in 1 round, as usual, but the appearance changes return
 a round later. They remain until the infusing magic is removed from the
 creature.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Infused Shielding (Su):</i> The infused magic acts as
 a versatile, but weak, magical shielding. Each round, the shielding can
 absorb 1d6 points of damage from magical attacks. Deduct the damage 
from the first attack that strikes the creature (an attack that deals 
damage always deals at least 1 point of damage). Apply any leftover 
shielding to subsequent attacks. For example, the 1d6 roll for a round 
indicates the shielding can absorb 6 points of damage this round. If the
 shielded creature is then struck by a <i>magic missile </i>spell that 
deals 5 points of damage, the shield absorbs 4 points of damage, the 
creature takes 1 point of damage, and the shielding can absorb 2 point 
of damage from further magical attacks this round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Level Adjustment:</b> +1.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Magic-Infused Advanced Mimic:</b> CR 7; Huge 
aberration (shapechanger); HD 15d8+75; hp 142; Init +4; Spd 10 ft.; AC 
16, touch 8, flat-footed 16; Base Atk +11; Grp +27; Atk +18 melee

-8, Jump +2, Listen +12, Spot +12; Alertness, Improved Initiative, 
Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Disguise), Weapon Focus 
(slam).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adhesive (Ex):</b> A magic-infused advanced mimic 
exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any 
creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic 
automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. 
Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the magic-infused mimic is 
alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an 
adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 
18 Reflex save. A successful DC 18 Strength check is needed to pry it 
off. Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can 
grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the 
substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Crush (Ex):</b> A magic-infused mimic deals 2d6+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aura of Magic (Sp):</b> The magic-infused advanced 
mimic always detects as magical under spells that detect the presence of
 magic. The type of magic is transmutation, and the strength is "faint."
 </p>
<p align="left"><b>Infused Shielding (Su):</b> The infused magic acts as
 a versatile, but weak, magical shielding. Each round, the shielding can
 absorb 1d6 points of damage from magical attacks. Deduct the damage 
from the first attack that strikes the creature (an attack that deals 
damage always deals at least 1 point of damage). Apply any leftover 
shielding to subsequent attacks. For example, the 1d6 roll for a round 
indicates the shielding can absorb 6 points of damage this round. If the
 shielded creature is then struck by a <i>magic missile </i>spell that 
deals 5 points of damage, the shield absorbs 4 points of damage, the 
creature takes 1 point of damage, and the shielding can absorb 2 point 
of damage from further magical attacks this round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Infused with Magic (Ex):</b> The magic-infused 
advanced mimic's whole body is infused with magic, which permeates the 
creature the same way that water does a human. This infused magic never 
leaves, and it never grows in strength unless the creature is further 
exposed to a source of infusing magic. Removing the magic absorbed in 
this place requires a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell that succeeds against a 24th-level caster, or a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Mimic Shape (Ex):</b> A magic-infused advanced mimic 
can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly 3,375 
cubic feet (15 feet by 15 feet by 15 feet), such as a small hut, or a 
large toolshed, or some other structure. The creature cannot 
substantially alter its size, though. Its body is hard and has a rough 
texture, no matter what appearance it might present. Anyone who examines
 the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by 
the mimic's Disguise check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Minor Polymorph (Sp):</b> The infusing magic affects 
the body of the magic-infused advanced mimic. Minor changes occur to the
 creature' form that the creature cannot control or remove without 
ridding itself of the infusing magic. These minor appearance-changing 
effects can include horns, a forked tongue, reddish or bluish skin tone 
(or any other color), change in hair color or length, baldness, and the 
sudden appearance of tattoos linked thematically to the creature in some

 remain with the creature if it changes its form via polymorph or 
similar magic. Creatures with the shapechanger subtype can revert to 
their true forms in 1 round, as usual, but the appearance changes return
 a round later. They remain until the infusing magic is removed from the
 creature.</p>
