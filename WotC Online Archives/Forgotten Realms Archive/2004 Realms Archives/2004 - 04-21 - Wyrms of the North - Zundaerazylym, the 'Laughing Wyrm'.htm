<table border="0" width="570" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">Few have heard of Zundaerazylym, but this last Wyrm of 
the North (in Volo's researches, at least) should be famous -- or 
infamous -- from one end of Toril to the other. She's not, however, a 
seeker of publicity. This ancient steel dragon (called by some a 
"Greyhawk dragon") has been hiding in human form for years in 
Neverwinter. She has taken her true shape only to fight off a raiding 
mage of the Brotherhood of the Arcane -- Aerlendan "Shadowtalons" 
Mardilaer, whom she tore apart over the Sea of Swords in the Year of the
 Wave (1364 DR) -- and to devour a pair of wyverns who some forty years 
earlier made the fatal mistake of deciding to lair in the southernmost 
Crags.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In her human existence, Zundaerazylym is Amundra 
Nelaerdra, a plump, gossiping, happy laundress and seamstress who makes 
stylish everyday gowns and cloaks for the ladies of Neverwinter. She 
also repairs and cleans all the exotic costumes and flashy garb worn at 
the Moonstone Mask, the most famous inn, restaurant, and festhall in the
 City of Skilled Hands.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Nelaerdra is pudgy, stooping, and going gray (in 
attractive streaks), but Zundaerazylym does spend occasional nights in 
more attractive human guises, taking the shape of sick or weary lady 
staffers at the Mask.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The owner of the Mask, the sorceress Ophala 
Cheldarstorn, has led her staff to believe her own spells transform a 
"skilled but aging courtesan" to take their places. Ophala and 
Zundaerazylym are firm friends, and the sorceress knows Amundia 
Nelaerdra's true nature. Ophala aids the steel dragon from time to time 
with her spells, and she keeps Zundaerazylym's hoard magically hidden in
 an undisclosed place. It is not buried underground, in the Mask, or in 
Nelaerdia's Bright Weaves Laundry.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym often helps out Ophala in return. More 
than once the "Laughing Laundress of Neverwinter" has smuggled prominent
 guests out of the Mask in her gigantic baskets of laundry, enabling 
them to avoid embarrassing confrontations with rivals, murderous foes, 
spouses, superiors, or admirers. She has also, on several memorable 
nights, flown important agents and members of the Lords' Alliance out of
 Neverwinter on her back when they needed to be elsewhere in a hurry.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym claims no domain, but she considers 
Neverwinter her territory. She defends it against other dragons who dare
 to reveal themselves openly and aggressively in or above its streets or
 try to dominate its folk (rather than dwelling among them as she does).
 Battle so excites her that she chortles and hoots almost constantly 
during combat -- hence, her nickname, "the Laughing Wyrm." So far, no 
one has connected the Laughing Laundress with the Laughing Wyrm . . . 
but then, there's no reason they should. Amundra Nelaerdra doesn't 
behave proudly or as if she has secrets apart from the latest juicy 
gossip.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym likes adventurers (though she's wary of 
large mercenary companies and secretive organizations), is wary of 
unfamiliar wizards, and dislikes blusterers and tyrants -- whether they 
be children lording it over their fellows in alleys or kings who 
mistreat their subjects or try to conquer new territory. She often seeks
 out drunken, brawling, or bullying sailors who have come to port 
(Luskanites are habitual offenders), or haughty or overly cruel visiting
 adventurer-mages, and teaches them a lesson. She usually lures them 
into private places by posing as a flirtatious tavern wench, then 
changes to dragon form with clashing jaws and wild laughter. Usually 
Zundaerazylym lets those she has terrified flee unscathed, but she has 
been known to tear a mage's staff, cloak, and garments away (to remove 
his magic), or break a sailor's sword-arm and the sword with it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym might seem to do no more than take the 
usual whimsical interest in humans that any steel dragon "gone human" 
does, but she has more secret schemes and hushed achievements than most 
dragons can imagine. Zundaerazylym follows a bright dream of her own. 
She wants dragonkind to live in harmony with humanoids -- perhaps as the
 champions and defenders of realms peopled and governed by (as she puts 
it) "the teeming, so-called 'civilized' races." This, she believes, 
would result in happier, better lives for all. To accomplish this, wyrms
 have to see themselves as guardians of a common treasure, not "their 
own" hoards. Rapacious dragons must be slain, and all dragons must find 
food that is not the creatures they hope to dwell with (or great numbers
 of these same creatures' livestock). Some dragons will always feel the 
need to hunt, but hunger mustn't force them to eat their allies, 
friends, or fellow citizens.</p>
<table align="right" border="1" bordercolor="#999999" width="240" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Longbite</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The edible fungi that makes cavern-dwelling orcs so 
energetic, fertile, and hardy is a brown, fissured, rather 
fuzzy-textured yet crunchy substance that grows in even the coldest, 
dampest caverns. It needs no light, but it flourishes when light is 
present and expands at a riotous rate in the presence of volcanic or 
other heat. Found growing in striations or parallel, horizontal "ridges"
 on rock walls, it is called <i>arantym</i> by the dwarves and (thanks to its appearance) "ripplebark" to humans, though it isn't bark at all.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This nut-flavored, woody fungus spreads by means of 
spores. These spores are harmless to humans; when inhaled or ingested, 
they simply pass through the body like other wastes, and can thus be 
carried as humans travel. The spores can consume living or dead wood, 
plant material, other fungi, and even airborne nutrients (from mists). 
Ripplebark can lay dormant for long periods of drought, extreme cold, or
 lack of nutrition; to remain alive, it needs to "feed" only about every
 eight years. Scorched or dead ripplebark turns black but is still 
edible, and it alters disease germs as it absorbs them, rendering them 
harmless. Orcs thrive on this unexciting but abundant fare.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In her search for a lasting replacement food source for 
dragons, Zundaerazylym seized on ripplebark and for many years tried to 
modify or augment it. At length she hit upon a still-secret mixture in 
which she soaks ripplebark fragments for a month to create what she 
calls "longbite." (Formally, the substance is known as <i>routhduin</i>,
 which is a word concocted from elven, dwarven and draconic roots, 
combined to mean something akin to "improved to achieve satiation" or 
"bettered to be satisfying."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Her process renders the ripplebark able to sustain all 
but the most terribly wounded or most active dragons for months on a 
small meal. "Most active" includes those rare dragons who spend a third 
of their time fighting or hunting. "Small" in this case means a volume 
of longbite roughly equivalent to the bodies of three average-sized 
humans.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym's mixture -- an iridescent syrup -- is known to be predominantly water and include an <i>elixir of vitality</i>
 (a magical draught that removes fatigue, exhaustion, poison, and 
disease, and sustains the drinker without food and water for seven 
days), dissolved <i>air spores</i> (a magic item that grants 2d4 days of
 breathable air regardless of the surrounding environment), the sap of 
oak or ash trees, dissolved pearls and at least a dozen other 
ingredients, many of which are powdered. Soft Claw agents believe that 
the ground bones of some creature are one of these and have learned to 
their cost that the mixture is poisonous if drunk (even sipped 
sparingly) by elves, half-elves, or humans.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Laughing Wyrm keeps her agents so busy retrieving 
large varieties of strange substances for her (some of which are 
undoubtedly continuing experiments aimed at creating a successful 
"Softscale Soak," another one of her creations), such as pumice, pine 
nuts, chicken livers, lamb kidneys, and bulrushes, that no one has been 
able to set down a definitive ingredient list for "longbite." 
Zundaerazylym is even known to have made large profits by cornering the 
market on particular goods, then reselling them in bulk when shortages 
occur.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some of her acquisitions -- many of them stored in 
hidden caverns under the Neverwinter Woods and garrisoned by the Soft 
Claws -- may not be for alchemical purposes at all.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Softscale Soak</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Not so different in appearance from the current 
incarnation of the "longbite" mixture, the "Softscale Soak" is an 
experimental healing and restorative bath for dragons. It is intended to
 keep the scales supple, the senses keen, and otherwise slow the 
physical side effects of age, allowing the complete regeneration of 
sorely wounded dragons. Ingredients of the current Soak, which is 
thought to have accomplished Zundaerazylym's first and lesser healing 
aim, are known to include the discarded shells of hatched dragon eggs, 
as well as dissolved dragon bones and scales (though just what was used 
to dissolve them, the Laughing Wyrm keeps secret).</p>
<p align="LEFT">At least once, Zundaerazylym has plunged into the heart 
of an orc horde in the mountain vales and deliberately lingered in 
battle until badly wounded. She was then snatched back to a disused 
quarry near Conyberry by the spells of Ophala Cheldarstorn and lowered 
into a bath of her own preparation. Most of these Soaks failed to do 
more than soothe her, but the Laughing Wyrm still believes a successful,
 sovereign healing bath for dragons is possible, if she can just hit 
upon the right formula for it.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The Dreaming Wyrm (as her agents, the Soft Claws, call 
her; just to confuse things, they also refer to her as "the Never Wyrm")
 is quick to say "Dreamers are dangerous," but she's become that most 
deadly force for change: a being who energetically tries to make her 
dreams become real. She's set about trying to protect civilization in 
the Sword Coast North and create the alternative food source she deems 
necessary.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Protecting Civilization</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym sees two great dangers to the North: the 
harsh climate and orc hordes. The first must be endured (magical 
attempts to meddle with the weather, in her opinion, lead only to 
disasters), but the Dreaming Wyrm believes she can do something about 
the orc problem.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Orcs are fecund; and periodically they grow too numerous
 for their homes in the labyrinthine mountain-heart caverns of the 
North. When this happens, they boil forth and sweep down on all surface 
settlements and creatures in their path, pushing onward (usually south, 
toward warmer, more lush lands) until they are eventually destroyed, 
leaving great destruction in their wake.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What if the most evil, hungry, and aggressive dragons 
held lairs in the path of the emerging orc hordes, so that the one would
 be forced to fight the other? Somehow such dragons must be manipulated 
into relocating their lairs in the right places. Zundaerazylym tries to 
do this through her agents, the Soft Claws, with carefully planted 
legends and rumors about lost dragon hoards and vacant dragon lairs that
 slowly confer magical powers to wyrms who dwell in them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Soft Claws</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">To gain materials for her immersion projects, to keep 
watch on orc populations, and to gather information on the whereabouts 
and deeds of dragons throughout western Faerûn, Zundaerazylym needs a 
band of capable but nondescript undercover agents. She began recruiting 
such from the ranks of local traders, woodcarvers, and failed 
adventurers some forty years ago, and the dedicated folk she is pleased 
to call her Soft Claws now number over sixty humans, elves, halflings, 
and half-elves. These agents operate as far east as Suzail and as far 
south as Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Laughing Wyrm suspects there are both Heralds and 
Harpers in the Soft Claws, but she worries more about infiltration by 
the Cult of the Dragon, the Arcane Brotherhood, or mages bent on gaining
 power over dragons. This concern has deepened in recent years, since 
more than one of her agents have gone missing -- and their <i>nevertokens</i> with them. <i>Nevertokens</i>
 are magical recognition badges carried by all Soft Claws, given to them
 by Zundaerazylym. She has a cache of identical items, for the entire 
cache of Halruaan family trading-tokens was given to her in the Year of 
the Watching Cold (1320 DR) by Ensible Mritavvalan, the dying last 
member of that family.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Soft Claws have many duties beyond spying and 
fetching. They try to "relocate" active dragons by improving or even 
creating lair-caverns in desired locales (remote northern mountains; 
perilously close to orc colonies); daringly planting maps (usually in 
the packsacks of "recovered treasure") near known dragon lairs; or even 
posing as adventurers and using farhailing spells to talk to one another
 about rich dragon lairs they're heading for, so that a dragon in its 
lair "accidentally" overhears them. They also plant rumors in the ranks 
of the Cult of the Dragon to manipulate the activities of that evil 
organization.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some prominent members of the northern society are Soft 
Claws. Bruldin Oldturret (NG male human Ftr6) is a trader of plain 
appearance, stolid expression, and wide knowledge of northern forest 
trails and backlands. Tamaer Shiversword (CG male half-elf Ftr9) is a 
flamboyant failed adventurer with a knack for mimicry and a love of 
pranks, bold gambles, and disguises. Jhavaerra Erbrand (CG female human 
Rog4) is a well-traveled "finder" or talent scout for the Mask who 
serves the Claws by establishing trading contacts among merchants in 
distant cities, gathering information on dragons and the Dragon Cult, 
and so on. Finally, Iorl Skyndul (CG male human Rog6) is a Calishite 
thief, smuggler, and fence of stolen goods who delights in all the minor
 magics Zundaerazylym has given him over the years and the deceptions he
 can accomplish using them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Soft Claws use the Moonstone Mask as their primary 
covert rallying place and regard the Laughing Wyrm as a kindly mother. 
This is fitting, when one considers that she nurses them back to health,
 occasionally comes winging to their rescue, arranges careers for them, 
and dispenses advice as well as unofficial salaries. These payments come
 irregularly but often; Zundaerazylym is never short of money thanks to 
her trading acumen, the efforts of the Claws on her behalf, and the 
legacy left to her by the last of the Mritavvalans, whom she rescued 
from family foes and guarded for the last three decades of his life. She
 always has time to sit with her agents and discuss their own dreams and
 goals.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Nevertokens</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The origin of these family tokens is now unknown. Many 
early Halruaan families possessed similar devices, but newer families 
have none. Elder families now either profess no knowledge of such 
things, or simply ignore queries regarding the items.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All of Zundaerazylym's <i>nevertokens</i> appear as 
identical, glossy-smooth, silvery blue, four-pointed metal stars. Each 
is 1-inch thick and about 4-inches across from point to point. They're 
lighter than their volume suggests, pierced in the center to allow a 
neckchain or keepstrap to be passed through them, and their points and 
edges are rolled and blunt. They are constructed of an unknown alloy 
that is extremely durable and resistant to damage. In fact, it's hard to
 mark a <i>nevertoken</i> with anything short of a forge hammer; when 
broken, a token typically bursts into a harmless flaring flame and falls
 to dust in seconds. All <i>nevertokens</i> are protected by a <i>blueshine</i> treatment (see <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>),
 and all emit a pleasant four-tone metallic chord, like a quartet of 
bells, when struck (a property difficult to fake without careful 
spellwork).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Nevertokens</i> constantly function as a <i>glove of storing</i>, <i>ring of feather falling</i>, and <i>ring of mind shielding</i>. All other <i>nevertoken</i>
 powers function when the item is grasped with bare flesh and a power is
 willed into action (a standard action). Handling a token doesn't yield 
any hint of its abilities; Zundaerazylym instructs her agents in token 
powers, yielding information about the strongest abilities only when she
 comes to trust a particular Soft Claw.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each of the listed powers can be used once per day. The 
tokens are known to have the following powers (they may have more, but 
the dragon has not revealed them): </p>
<ul>
<li><i>sending</i></li>
<li><i>teleport</i></li>
<li><i>trace nevertoken</i> -- as <i>know direction</i>, except pointing to the nearest <i>nevertoken</i>.</li>

Zundaerazylym can breathe a 100-foot line of acidic gas or a 100-ft. 
line of poisonous gas. Each creature in the area of the acidic gas takes

must succeed on a DC 31 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 
2d8+13 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the 
dragon moves off. If Zundaerazylym chooses to maintain the pin, treat it
 as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush
 each round if they don't escape. </p>

attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature in a 300-foot radius

<p align="LEFT"><b>Zundaerazylym's Fate</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The ambitious dreams pursued by the Laughing Wyrm, along
 with her spying on nearby dragons, seem likely to lead her into 
disaster. Most evil dragons will slay or capture her to gain her 
longbite secrets if they learn of them, and for Zundaerazylym's schemes 
to come to fruition, she must sooner or later reveal longbite to all 
dragons. Even if this is somehow accomplished so quickly and widely that
 one dragon can't gain an advantage over another, the Laughing Wyrm and 
her comparatively puny force of Soft Claws will still be faced with the 
problem of a dragon -- or the Cult of the Dragon (in the face of a 
crushing blow to their influence over dragons) -- moving 
enthusiastically to try to control most of the easily reached 
ripplebark.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even hints of a partially successful Softscale Soak 
would spell the same peril for Zundaerazylym. The Soft Claws know they 
are in for a dangerous ride in the years ahead -- and more than one of 
them knows what Zundaerazylym only suspects: Certain Harpers, and 
probably some of the Chosen, know of the Laughing Wyrm's activities. 
They might at any time choose to act against her or sweep in to seize 
what she has crafted.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Zundaerazylym knows of the increasing danger and seems 
to sense her remaining time might be short. With increasing daring, she 
is seeking out passing adventurers to carry her secrets to other places 
and custodians of lore, notably Candlekeep. Her gamble is a long shot 
indeed. If she succeeds, however, Faerûn will be changed forever . . . 
and that's more than many tyrants or gods accomplish.</p>
