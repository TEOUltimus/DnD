<p align="left">Across the Shaar, and in the Golden Water region, small 
herds of nomadic loxo hunt, gather, and keep to themselves. The 
elephantine humanoids appear strange even to people used to seeing orcs 
and bugbears on a daily basis, but they are only one of group of strange
 humanoids that wander the Shaar. The nomadic humanoids of the Shaar 
leave the shy loxo to their own devices, trading with them but never 
forming bonds. The loxo fiercely protect their herds, and some actually 
resent the intrusion of strange humanoids (read: non-loxo) on their 
peace and serenity.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2012-01%20-%20Realms%20Personalities%20-%20Dauphal,%20the%20Dangerous%20Bull_files/fx20041201_med.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="236" width="248">Every
 so often, though, a loxo is seen in the marketplace of Halagard in 
Halruaa, the taverns of Chavyondat in Estagund, in the pirate stronghold
 of Yaulazna, or among the mercenaries in the Border Kingdoms. Sometimes
 they move even farther north. Curiosity, or some dark deed, drives 
these young loxo to venture forth into unknown lands and seek their 
fortunes. They are prized as mercenaries and bodyguards, and that is a 
sure way for them to make coin, but some few of these follow other 
paths.</p>
<p align="left">One such loxo is Dauphal, who is of average size and 
build (for a loxo). Born into a normal loxo childhood, he felt the 
yearning to wander at a young age and got into trouble frequently for 
exploring where his parents told him not to go. At age 14 he fled the 
herd of his birth and found his way to the trade city of Delzimmer. He 
has sometimes told people that wemics massacred his herd, but that and 
any other colorful details are mere exaggerations that he says so that 
he sounds interesting.</p>
<p align="left">Possessed of a keen mind but very poor social skills, 
Dauphal found life difficult at first. He learned to fight with the 
weapons of humans, worked as a thug to afford food, and strangely 
enjoyed every minute of that part of his life. Having to buy food in 
itself was a novel experience, and the start of many novel experiences. 
Eventually he took the road westward, and, after some travels, he fell 
into the hands of the Wyrm Master, a gnoll chieftain that operates from 
the Wyrmbones. Some loxo deity must have intervened on Dauphal's behalf,
 because the Wyrm Master chose to train Dauphal as his personal 
bodyguard rather than kill him. The loxo spent a number of years with 
the gnolls, learning the crafts of wilderness survival, tracking, and 
fighting. Though he never participated in any raids on caravans, and 
indeed never wanted to, he did help scout for locations and track down 
survivors so they could be killed.</p>
<p align="left">Eventually, his inherent morality objected to the evil 
that the gnolls did, and he used his skills to leave them in the night. 
He made his way south into Halruaa, and the town of Alaurim. Here, he 
was exposed to magic on a large scale for the first time, and he found 
it wonderful and frightening at the same time. After some initial 
hesitancy, he decided to learn this magic himself and asked the 
wizardess Rhodea Firehair to take him as an apprentice. She was, after 
all, the only one fearless enough to take on such a monstrous student. 
Dauphal learned a lot from her and was saddened when an accident with a 
dragon in the town mint caused her demise. When Rhodea's daughter was 
killed, Dauphal recognized evil forces at work and prudently decided to 
continue his wanderings.</p>
<p align="left">Dauphal may be found anywhere in the Shining South, or 
indeed anywhere else. He is curious about everything, and he fearlessly 
faces battle. Confident of his abilities, he nonetheless does not rush 
into a dangerous situation without thinking things through. He has a 
tendency to tell lies about his past, and though people are not sure 
that he is being truthful, they also don't know for certain that he is 
not. His curiosity can lead him into allying with evil forces, at least 
for a while, as well as good ones. Thus, he can be an ally, friend, or 
enemy of any player characters that cross his path.</p>
<p align="left">In combat, he has learned to take advantage of his size,
 strength, and reach. He is trained to charge as well as defend against 
charges, and his large glaive is always close to his hand. His longsword
 and short sword are never far from his hip. When someone charges him, 
he generally gets two attacks of opportunity against that foe, and then 
follows up with a withering set of blows. His magic is used primarily in
 support of his combat prowess, but he can cause damage with spells as 
well.</p>
