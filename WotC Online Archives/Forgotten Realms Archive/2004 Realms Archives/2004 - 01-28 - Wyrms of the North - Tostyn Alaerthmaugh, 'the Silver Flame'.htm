<p align="left"><i>Who needs the Bat Cave? This mercurial wyrm has the most fascinating lair in the North.</i></p>
<p align="left">Best known as "the Silver Flame" for his spectacular 
swoops and banks in the air above the trade roads of the North, this 
young adult male mercury dragon often features in the "current clack" of
 the Sword Coast because he wants to be in the center of everything 
important. Tostyn is curious, proud, and reckless, and he often charges 
into encounters with older, larger dragons, archmages engaged in 
spell-battle, and similar perils. He flies into and out of rages 
quickly, holding no grudges and considering no one a lasting foe. His 
every attitude, belief, like, and dislike change as often as the 
northern winds.</p>
<p align="left">Tostyn has shown more gallantry than most other living 
dragons -- and more open, roaring laughter. Lighthearted and 
enthusiastic by nature, he spends his time dashing about the Sword Coast
 North and can often be found in the vicinity of Waterdeep. "Stealth" is
 not a word he understands; when he's not dancing or looping across the 
skies, he's diving playfully at creatures on the ground or streaking 
along dodging treetops, executing corkscrew aerial rolls, as he hurtles 
along near the ground.</p>
<p align="left">More than any other known dragon, Tostyn cares nothing 
for the future; plans and food stores and building up treasure hoards 
don't concern him. He spends his days plunging into a succession of 
fresh delights, helping adventurers tear apart a ruin here, chasing some
 raiding wyverns there, pouncing on a pirate ship over here, then 
dodging among the storm clouds. The Silver Flame remembers beings he has
 met before (and particular powers or abilities he has seen them use), 
but he hates only those he has seen use poison or magical deception to 
bring misfortune to others, those who exhibit viciousness or cruelty, 
and those who greet him with treachery.</p>
<p align="left">Until spells were put in place specifically to drive him
 off, Tostyn made quite a habit of "crashing" the country parties of 
Waterdhavian nobles. He still attends those he can slip into while in 
human form (thanks to a magical pendant he possesses), but he has 
learned not to grandly assume his true form during the revels; the 
spells that guard against his arrival act when he reveals his presence, 
blasting him from all sides. Such onslaughts have caused him enough 
painful crash landings to dissuade him from taking his true form within 
sight of the city of Waterdeep.</p>
<p align="left">Tostyn Alaerthmaugh is a strong flyer and aerial 
acrobat, as well as a good mimic. He seems to have a natural gift for 
sensing deceptions, disguises, and "when things aren't right." His sense
 of humor and restless enthusiasm define Tostyn; setting traps and 
considering consequences aren't for him.</p>
<p align="left">He's the boldest of an overlarge brood of dragons 
birthed by the gigantic, venerable mercury dragon Thmaughra, on a huge 
island far to the southwest of Evermeet. Thmaughra's brood soon proved 
too large for the wild beasts of the isle to sustain. (The island has 
few metallic ores and has been grazed heavily by generations of dragons,
 until forage for only a half-dozen or so was left.) So Tostyn (his 
surname means "son of Thmaughra" or, literally, "Acknowledged hatchling 
of many in not the first brood of Thmaughra, male of her blood"), the 
most bored of the brood, took wing eastward in search of new lands to 
explore. The way was long, and he would probably have perished by 
drowning after becoming too weak to fly, but he caught a favorable storm
 wind and rode it for many, many leagues. He then chanced upon a large, 
abandoned ship drifting on the waves and rested atop it until he was 
ready to fly on. Chance brought him to Ruathym and then ashore south of 
Neverwinter, where he roamed the North until he stumbled upon possibly 
the best lair any wyrm of the North can boast.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tostyn Alaerthmaugh's Lair</b></p>
<p align="left">The Silver Flame lairs in the depths of the Everlake, at
 the heart of the Evermoors, but spends little time at home. Tostyn made
 his lair where he discovered a "hole" in the waters at the heart of the
 lake: a magical shaft of air in the water, where magic keeps an 
invisible column of air free of the damp, offering an entrance to a 
mansion beneath the muddy lake bottom.</p>
<p align="left">This nameless abode was probably once the home of a 
powerful wizard (it was simply bristling with magical wards and 
defenses, most of which Tostyn has left unaltered), but it was long 
abandoned when the Silver Flame discovered it. He found a "control 
amulet" that allowed him to command the powers of the mansion, tore 
apart some of its interior walls to give himself room to move about in 
comfort, and made himself at home. Today, that amulet is hidden 
somewhere in the lair, and its location is known only to the dragon.</p>
<p align="left">Tostyn tries never to enter the shaft of air when there 
are creatures nearby to see him (and he usually flies over the Everlake 
looking for humans or other beings on the shores of the lake before 
plunging into his lair). However, flocks of birds flying across the lake
 often unintentionally find the lair; from time to time an unseen spell 
in its depths comes to life and sucks fresh air down the shaft, swirls 
it around, and drives out stale air (which then comes shooting up the 
shaft as the suction ends). Small flying creatures could well find 
themselves making an unexpected journey either up or down the airshaft. 
At least one adventurer employing a <i>fly</i> spell discovered the lair
 in this way, but fled from its depths without investigating beneath the
 lake bottom. Several incorporeal creatures have deliberately stolen 
into the lair and survived their visit; Volo assembled a fragmentary 
picture of its interior from their accounts. The shaft enters the lake 
bottom, descends for 80 feet or so, and then curves to rise up again 
some 20 feet, emerging into a large entry chamber. Six "gargoyle golems"
 await here; they'll attack any intruding creature who isn't Tostyn or 
accompanied by him, pursuing as far as the "safe passage" (see 
hereafter). They know the nature and precise locations of traps beyond 
their chamber and avoid them at the last instant, giving no sign of 
breaking off pursuit or proceeding tentatively until they reach real 
danger.</p>
<p align="left">Four 60-foot-high archways in the walls of the entry 
chamber open into high and wide passages that run straight into the 
rock, fanning out like the fingers of a human hand for several hundred 
yards before beginning a succession of bends, right angles, and 
archways. Three are "false" ways that wind through a succession of 
mechanical traps (blades that snap out of walls, falling stone blocks 
attached to chains that immediately draw the blocks back up into their 
ceiling sockets, and so on).</p>
<p align="left">The fourth route is the only safe one (Volo hasn't been 
able to determine just which of the four arches opens into it), and it 
soon reaches a passage lined with magic stone statues that move in 
reaction to the presence of intruders (raising arms menacingly, turning 
to always face creatures moving along the passage, and so on). The 
statues are designed to frighten intruders into turning back, but they 
cause no harm even if touched or attacked. Many are broken and have been
 strapped together with metal bands or have been propped up on stone 
blocks; they are ancient relics salvaged from a Netherese ruin 
elsewhere.</p>
<p align="left">Between each pair of statues, a door is set into the 
wall; all of the doors are huge, 40-foot-high ovals with barbed points 
protruding from their centers, like so many giant spike-bossed shields. 
Almost all of the doors are false; just one can be made to open, 
swinging on counterweights so that even a lone halfling can operate it. 
The bosses on all of the fake doors are really wards, and they fire at 
any intruding creature that moves two doors beyond the real one, 
unleashing cold, electricity, or hold effects for as long as any living 
creature remains "beyond" the real door.</p>
<p align="left">The "safe passage" behind the real door forks; one 
branch leads to a chamber heaped with Tostyn's "treasure," and the other
 rises to a sleeping area. The sleeping chamber almost reaches the 
surface; if his lair were ever flooded, Tostyn could claw his way 
through the ceiling to freedom, destroying a small, bare rocky islet in 
the process. (The waters of the Everlake would then pour into the lair 
through this new route.) The only feature of this sleeping chamber is a 
huge mound of earth covered with soft, lush mosses collected and planted
 by the dragon.</p>
<p align="left">The dragon's treasure consists of a pile of shiny rocks 
(metallic ores, largely copper, destined for future meals); a much 
larger pile of items Tostyn deemed "junk" when he rearranged the lair to
 meet his needs -- mainly broken furniture and rotting scraps of fabric,
 but there are many vases, stools, and the like that possess minor 
(perhaps even powerful) magic. Their soft glows give the room an eerie 
appearance and light enough for any intruders to see what floats above 
the treasure: a gigantic brain trailing ten tentacles beneath it, its 
parrotlike beak opening and shutting soundlessly from time to time. This
 is a dead grell preserved, held aloft, and animated by magic already in
 place when Tostyn first entered the undertake mansion. It has no powers
 or sentience, is not undead, and reacts to intruders only by turning to
 face them and working its beak. The Silver Flame considered it trash 
and brought it here from elsewhere in the mansion; the purpose for which
 it was enspelled is now lost and unknown.</p>
<p align="left">There are a few unfinished "digging chambers" open off 
the passage that climbs to the sleeping area. These rooms have been left
 unfinished, ending where digging for future expansion was obviously 
proceeding until an abrupt halt. Tostyn uses these to house his slowly 
growing collection of trophies. Accounts vary as to which things are in 
what rooms, but the contents are known to include magic automatons 
(mainly various sorts of golems), "devices" (grinding gears from a 
horse-powered mill; a siege tower; the broken remnants of a gigantic -- 
over 300 feet across, when whole -- orrery depicting the movements of 
known celestial bodies in Realmspace; the steering vanes of a crashed 
Halruaan skyship; and so on), vessels (ships, wagons, and aerial craft 
the dragon has pounced on and captured), and other oddities.</p>
<p align="left">This last category is known to include the following 
items: a levitating, upright, massively armored metal "lich's coffin" 
from Tashluta that Tostyn has never been able to open (he still isn't 
sure of the contents); the complete, intact skeleton of a green dragon 
encased in clear, thick, articulated glass akin to the armor worn by 
warriors of Nimbral; a mummified beholder, still on the human-sized 
throne Tostyn found it slumped on, with all sorts of curious-looking 
wands, rods, and hoselike things clipped to a frame that encircles the 
grand seat; and a magic net that holds together a drifting, chiming 
collection of glass spheres, each one holding a different body part of a
 slain, bloodless male human in robes with one of his severed hands 
still clutching a wand, and his torso clad in robes worked with winking 
stars.</p>
<p align="left">A rather tattered "dragon disguise" designed to be 
strapped onto a giant or titan, who could then operate the false 
wire-and-silk dragon wings, claws, and tail by means of long rods (like a
 marionette) has also found a home in Tostyn's lair. Another curiosity 
consists of a massive, 10-foot-long stone pedestal with four arching 
arms reaching up from its sides to hold aloft above it a small, round 
stone slab. Three apparently identical clusters of controls, each 
consisting of raised stone studs made to fit the four spread fingers of a
 human hand, run down one edge of the table. Tostyn brought it hence 
from a shattered, abandoned wizard's tower somewhere in the Spine of the
 World mountains because of his interest in a fading note, which the 
dragon brought along. (It lies on the main slab, weighted down with a 
rock.) The note reads: "Ringforge; Netherese? Crafts <i>rings of spell storing</i>
 in upper tray when a proper creature is drained of life on main slab. 
Plain rings of any metal work, but instructions lost. Creature possibly 
draconic or undead." Tostyn has never attempted to find the lost 
instructions or experiment with the controls; he simply wanted such a 
device hidden away in his keeping, not out where some overly clever 
wizard might decide to experiment with its powers on a certain mercury 
dragon.</p>
<p align="left">The Silver Flame doesn't bother to bar or conceal the 
doorless arches of these rooms, and enough of their contents are still 
magically animated to give the appearance of ongoing life and activity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tostyn Alaerthmaugh's Domain</b></p>
<p align="left">Domains mean nothing to the Silver Flame, but he's 
(just) thoughtful enough to avoid blundering into the faces of larger, 
older dragons. It never enters Tostyn's head to respect any peculiar 
notions of ownership creatures may have, beyond a lair. After all, are 
there visible boundaries in the air, on the waves of the sea, or on the 
land itself? (Not counting the various, puny human-made walls and 
markers.) Of course not -- and neither should there be. Tostyn flies 
where Tostyn wills.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Deeds of Tostyn Alaerthmaugh</b></p>
<p align="left">Like all of his kind, the Silver Flame prefers metal 
ores to other food but won't hesitate to devour large quantities of 
red-blooded mammals he can get without a lot of hunting, digging, or 
chasing. This usually means penned herd animals or armed forces on the 
move (in the North, usually ore hordes or goblinkin raiding bands). The 
ferocious defenses mounted by the hired watch-mages of Luskan and 
Mirabar have dissuaded Tostyn from swooping down to snatch trade-bars or
 forge-ingots (though he still dares to make dead-of-night pounces on 
ore-barges away from harbors). Sometimes he also seeks out mine tailings
 and crumbling mountainsides in search of raw ore.</p>
<p align="left">Beyond these needs, Tostyn Alaerthmaugh devotes his time
 to avidly pursuing whatever entertainment presents itself, dashing 
across the North on the trail of his latest enthusiasm. He shows little 
interest in fighting or befriending other dragons, let alone forming 
alliances or mating.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Blindsense (Ex): </b>Tostyn can pinpoint creatures 
within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents he can't actually see still have
 total concealment against him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Brilliance (Ex): </b>As a standard action, Tostyn can
 use the mirror-bright membranes of his wings to reflect and concentrate
 available light into a beam of dazzling brightness. To use this power, 
he needs light as bright as an overcast day or a clear, moonlit night. 
Torchlight or candlelight is insufficient. The power creates a thin beam
 the dragon can aim at a single target within 150 feet. The target is 
blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Reflex DC 21 negates). If not using this 
technique as a weapon, Tostyn can create a cone of light as bright as a 
daylight spell up to 300 feet long. The cone lasts 3 rounds.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Keen Senses (Ex): </b>Tostyn can see four times as 
well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal 
light. He also has darkvision to a range of 120 feet.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tostyn Alaerthmaugh's Magic</b></p>
<p align="left">Though he has come to possess several spellbooks of age 
and interest, the Silver Flame as yet can use only the paltriest of the 
magic within them. In practice, he casts but a handful of fairly common 
spells and a few mending spells and unknown arcane healing magic his 
adventures (and misadventures) make necessary. Of more interest and 
importance to adventurers having contact with him are the magic items he
 employs.</p>
<p align="left">The control amulet for Tostyn's lair isn't detailed 
here, since Volo could learn nothing about its appearance or apparently 
extensive powers. The Silver Flame is known to wear a <i>ring of the ram</i>
 and the pendant detailed hereafter, which he recovered from the 
skeletal remains of its maker on a mountaintop somewhere in the North.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Chassabra's Pendant (Minor Artifact): </b>Crafted by 
the long-ago sorceress for whom it is named, this piece of jewelry 
appears to be a delicate diamond-shaped piece of polished copper, chased
 with a design of three closed, long-lashed human eyes set in a triangle
 (one eye below two side-by-side eyes), and hung around a small-linked 
necklace chain. The spells laid on the pendant render it terrifically 
strong and nonmetallic (it is no longer affected by magnetism [though 
copper is nonferrous and usually isn't magnetic] or spells that work on 
metal, and it is no longer a conductor of heat or electricity) and make 
it automatically alter to fit a wearer. It is as hard as adamantine 
(hardness 20, 5 hp).</p>
<p align="left">When donned, <i>Chassabra's pendant</i> mentally 
communicates its powers to its wearer (it is a self-identifying item), 
who can activate them by silent force of will alone (a standard action 
that provokes an attack of opportunity). Powers awaken almost instantly,
 but only one can be in use at a time; "turning on" one extinguishes 
another. The exceptions to this are the three automatic, 
always-functioning powers of the pendant, which affect only the wearer; 
these are <i>see invisibility</i>, <i>feather fall</i>, and immunity to <i>magic missiles</i>.</p>
<p align="left">It also has the following powers: 4/day -- <i>faerie fire</i>
 (when the user actives this power, creatures and objects within a 
5-foot radius, centered on the user [but not the user himself] become 
outlined with <i>faerie fire</i>; the effect lasts 10 minutes; other than the duration and the very short range, this power works just like the a <i>faerie fire </i>spell.); 3/day -- <i>dimension door</i>; 2/day -- <i>polymorph</i>; 1/day -- <i>regenerate</i>
 (as the spell, except regenerates all missing tissue in a single round 
whether or not the severed body parts are present and attached).</p>
<p align="left">Strong (abjuration, conjuration, divination, evocation, transmutation); CL 15th;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left">Tostyn Alaerthmaugh uses the <i>polymorph</i> power of <i>Chassabra's pendant</i>
 often to visit revels and gatherings (usually nobles' parties in 
Waterdeep) in human form; he loves to flirt, gossip, and mix with 
exciting folk who have interesting things to say or dreams and schemes 
afoot.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gaze Screen<br></b>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Clr 2, Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target:</b> 1 living creature<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</p>
<p align="left">You create a shimmering, mirrorlike area in the air 
before the recipient's eyes. The area moves with the recipient and does 
not affect the recipient's vision. If the recipient is subjected to a 
gaze attack while the spell lasts, there is a 50% chance that recipient 
does not need to make saving throw against the attack (just as if the 
recipient had averted his eyes). The foe with the gaze attack does not 
have concealment from the recipient (see Gaze Attacks on page 294 of the
 <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>). The recipient gets no additional
 protection from averting his eyes while the spell lasts, though he can 
shut his eyes and entirely avoid the gaze.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tostyn Alaerthmaugh's Fate</b></p>
<p align="left">The Silver Flame is not likely to reach a happy old age;
 he takes too many chances to flourish in a region of winter weather, 
where the inhabitants include periodic orc hordes and such perils as the
 other dragons described in earlier "Wyrms of the North" installments, 
the Brotherhood of the Arcane in Luskan, and Cult of the Dragon agents 
that keep growing in numbers, reach, and hunger.</p>
<p align="left">If luck favors him at critical moments, however, he may 
live long enough to leave his mark; he combines more energy than any ten
 other dragons of the North with keen wits and a growing understanding 
of human society and intrigues (particularly in the Waterdeep area). 
When his restless dabbling in human schemes and affairs grows either 
more prolonged or more effective, Tostyn will begin to make formidable 
foes -- and be approached by others to become an ally.</p>
<p align="left">These relationships might enmesh him more deeply in 
human affairs, and it's likely that although he'll always be a 
capricious dilettante, the Silver Flame will also begin to enjoy "doing 
something that matters." The right adventuring band or power group could
 steer his considerable energies toward achieving their own goals, from 
destroying the outposts of their enemies to kidnapping, rescuing, or 
harassing individuals. Tostyn already knows that wizards have spellbooks
 and magic items that interest him; he'll need little persuasion to 
attack wizards he takes a dislike to (those who attack him, for 
instance). As for Tostyn's own fate, Elminster suggested that an old 
Northern saying applies: "A good war arrow can shake a realm, or even 
sweep it away, with but a single well-aimed flight . . . but if that 
strike comes in a time of war, against an armored foe, that strike tends
 to be hard on the arrow."</p>
