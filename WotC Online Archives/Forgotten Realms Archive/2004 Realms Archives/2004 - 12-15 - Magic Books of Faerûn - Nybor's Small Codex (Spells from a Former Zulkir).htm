<p align="LEFT"><i>This red book is no larger than a standard spellbook.
 Bound in red leather, it has burned into its cover a picture of a bald,
 tattooed woman of exotic but attractive looks. Burned under the picture
 is a row of evil-looking letters. The edges of the pages are normal 
parchment, and a red silk bookmark hangs from the spine.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Last Record:</b> Unknown Halruaan wizard, 14 Marpenoth, 1372 DR.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Description:</b> This book is about the same size as a
 typical wizard's spellbook, including the number of pages. The burn 
image on the cover depicts a Thayan woman, normally obvious because of 
the bald head and the tattoos, but also revealed in her facial features.
 The letters on the cover are in the Infernal alphabet, spelling out 
"Nybor's Small Codex" in the Thayan variant of the Mulhorandi language. 
The lettering on the inside uses a different handwriting than the cover 
(possibly because of the means used to burn the letters in the cover, 
whether magic or heated wire), with large calligraphic letters that make
 even the Infernal script look pleasant. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The book seems old (at least eighty years) but is in very good condition. It has the <i>major resistant</i>, <i>pungent</i>, and <i>waterproof</i> spell protections from <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>, which means that to normal tests the book seems fireproof. (It can easily withstand burning in a stove or campfire.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>History:</b> While many scholars in Faerûn know the 
name Nybor because of the wicked spells bearing that name, few know much
 about the woman who created those spells or where she is now. Those few
 who study Thayan history say that she was once the zulkir of 
enchantment, seizing that position at an early age by clever 
manipulation of lovers, servants, spies, and assassins. The young Nybor 
used her new power to indulge her magical whims, wiping out an entire 
army of human and monstrous soldiers in testing will-sapping spells and 
other mind-reaving magic. Unlike other Red Wizards who hoarded their 
magic, she gave copies of her now-famous spells to many key teachers and
 as a result her name is famous in Thay and elsewhere. She dabbled in 
item creation, particularly animate and intelligent weapons, and the few
 who know anything about her believe she was working on a way to animate
 a battlefield full of weapons with the stolen minds of enemy soldiers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What little else is known about her is that she 
disappeared in 1296 DR (the Year of the Black Hound), leaving her 
mansion unexpectedly in the middle of the night without instructions. 
Her senior waited a week before entering her inner sanctum, and there he
 found two large pools of blood. Her work table had been used recently 
but whatever she was working on was gone. After six months of mundane 
detective work and repeated divinations showed she was either dead or 
not on Toril, a new zulkir was appointed to her position.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A few years after her disappearance, a Thayan wizard in 
Thesk claimed to have a magic dagger with all of Nybor's memories. He 
was found dead in his room, burned to a crisp and dismembered, and his 
bodyguards turned to stone. Every few years someone else claims to find 
this dagger and usually comes to a foul end shortly after, and the 
dagger is nowhere to be found. Included in the ranks of the unfortunate 
victims of the dagger's "curse" are Lerem the Lucky (an adventuring 
rogue of Luskan), who was found stabbed to death in an alley of 
Calimport; Saint Schend of Waterdeep (an aasimar paladin of Ilmater), 
who was nearly killed in Menzoberranzan when an unknown attacker's spell
 left him paralyzed just before a drow assassin's attack; and Maurgus 
the Black Bolt, a skilled but secretive Zhent assassin, who was seen 
screaming in fear and running directly into the conflict between Cyric 
and Xvim that moments later destroyed much of Zhentil Keep.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Nybor's Simple Codex</i> is the only known book 
written in her hand that has ever left Thay. Second- and third-hand 
copies of her spells have trickled from the east for many years (usually
 in black market deals between Thayans willing to break the old ban on 
exporting magic and desperate mages in need of fast magical power) but 
the <i>Codex</i> is the only verifiable book she wrote that is known to 
be outside Thay. Presumably her remaining spellbooks and notes are in 
the hands of her former apprentices or their heirs. In addition to its 
value as a spellbook, the <i>Codex</i> has great historical value, since
 its composition and arrangement show it is a personal spellbook of a 
zulkir, probably intended as a traveling spellbook but never completed. 
How it made its way out of Thay and its present whereabouts are unknown.
 Those searching for it should know that the cursed dagger that bears 
her memories always knows the exact direction to the book as long as 
both are on Faerûn. Those seeking the <i>Codex</i> should find the 
dagger, use it to locate the book, and get rid of the dagger as quickly 
as possible. The last person believed to possess the book is a Halruaan 
wizard seen in the border kingdoms asking after an exiled Thayan wizard 
trying to establish a barony there. The last person known to have the 
dagger is Graytooth, a Theskan orc (a Zhent soldier of the Horde 
Crusade, settled in his new homeland) who disappeared later in 1372 (and
 was found dead in the forest a week later), almost at the same time the
 Halruuan wizard was seen in the Border Kingdoms.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Contents:</b> The book has no title page or 
descriptive text. The first 33 of its 100 pages contain six spells, the 
rest are blank. These spells are considered unusual spells, and any 
spellcaster who wishes to use them must first decipher them as described

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The distance traveled is always 1d100 miles. Upward 
teleportation means the target arrives in thin air and probably falls to
 its death. Downward teleportation normally means the target is encased 
in rock. If the destination is within a solid object, the target takes 
1d6 points of damage and is shunted to a random open space on a suitable
 surface within 100 feet. If no free space exists within 100 feet, the 
target takes an additional 2d6 points of damage and is shunted to a free
 space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, 
the target is fused with the solid matter and dies instantly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the target succeeds at its Will saving throw, the 
target instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level 
(maximum +25) from teleportation feedback.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As with all touch spells, you can cast this spell on yourself, using it as an error-prone <i>teleport</i> in an emergency.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Nybor invented this spell as a creative way of dealing 
with people who bothered her. The "joy" in the spell's name refers to 
her joy at seeing them leave rather than the target's joy for the 
journey.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nybor's Psychic Imprint<br></b>Transmutation [Evil, Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Sorcerer/Wizard 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target: </b>Creature touched<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous and see text<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT">You create a magical field in the mind of the target 
creature, then use that field to recreate the target's mind in a gem. 
The stress of this mental attack knocks the target unconscious and deals
 it enough ability drain to reduce his Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma to 0, leaving the subject comatose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The psychic imprint stored in the gem is unstable and 
dissipates after 1 day per caster level unless the gem is crafted into a
 magic item or becomes part of a magic item. If so used, the item 
becomes intelligent (gaining the personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, 
Charisma, alignment, general memories, and languages known of the target
 creature). Any other properties associated with an intelligent item 
(such as empathy, speech, or telepathy, senses, and capabilities) must 
be crafted and paid for appropriately using the costs listed in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i>
 The psychic impression has no ranks in any skills or any other 
abilities other than what is described above (so an item made with the 
impression of a powerful cleric has only general knowledge pertaining to
 the target's religion); to tap into these abilities the item crafter 
must add appropriate item capabilities (in the cleric example, the item 
crafter would need to pay for the "item has 10 ranks in Knowledge" 
lesser power).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since the gem retains the target's personality, any 
feelings the target had toward you are echoed by the gem and the crafted
 item. For example, if the target of the spell hates you, the item will 
hate you as well. This attitude includes any temporary modifiers to the 
target's mental state (since the magical field copies the target's <i>current</i> mental state), so a <i>charm person</i> spell on the target makes the item always view you as its best friend.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The target can recover from his ability drain as normal,
 and he and the item bear each other no ill will and have no unusual 
reaction to each other or way to recognize each other (in a way, their 
minds are similar but not identical in the same way as identical twins).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Note:</i> Normally this spell is used to recreate the
 mind of a loyal vassal in a magic item to ensure similar loyalty in the
 item. Nybor used it to create spies in the households of her rivals, 
duplicating the minds of her charmed apprentices and presenting the 
crafted items as gifts to those she wished to observe. Some who have 
heard of this spell believe it can be used on creatures that died 
recently, and, in such cases, serves to preserve the legacy of a dead 
hero without imprisoning her actual mind within the item. Others believe
 this spell can press the target's mind into a body of inert flesh 
(similar to a <i>clone</i> spell, except it works even if the original 
subject is still alive) and that has been used this way in the past to 
trick and subvert the unknowing.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component:</i> A gem of any type worth at 
least 250 gp times the total of the target's Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma ability bonuses (so a target with Int 12, Wis 12, and Cha 10 
requires a 500 gp gem and one with Int 18, Wis 18, Cha 10 requires a 
2,000 gp gem). If crafted into a magic item, the cost of the imprinted 
gem counts toward the total price of the item. A gem can hold only one 
psychic imprint at a time, but if its current imprint is allowed to 
fade, it can be reused as a focus for this spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Price:</b> 7,650 gp (spellbook value including 3,000 for <i>major resistant</i>, 2,000 for <i>pungent</i>, and 1,000 for <i>waterproof</i>
 spellbook-protection properties). As a unique spellbook by a (presumed 
dead) Thayan zulkir, it is worth 1,000 gp to a historian collector (such
 as those in Candlekeep) or Thayan enclave, or 2,000 gp to a Thayan 
enclave with strong ties to the zulkir of enchantment. An enclave is 
more likely to offer magic items or services rather than gold for the 
book.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Last Known Bearer:</b> Graytooth, Theskan (formerly Zhent) orc soldier</p>
<p align="LEFT">Graytooth was a disciplined orc soldier formerly 
stationed at Zhentil Keep and assigned with many of his fellows to 
travel east to stop the Tuigan Horde. He remained in Thesk (like the 
surviving members of the Zhent orc army), found a human bride, and 
raised a family on a small farm. None of his neighbors know how he found
 the strange dagger, only that one day he was wearing it on his belt and
 wasn't afraid to show it off to anyone who asked -- or who crossed him.
 In early autumn of 1372 he awoke early as normal, but instead of 
tending his fields he wandered into the forest without saying goodbye. 
His garroted body (sans dagger) was found a week later. Because of the 
means of his death, most believe some thief or assassin killed him to 
bring the dagger to a guild, possibly the Shadowmasters of Telflamm. The
 lack of a trail leading away from Graytooth's body supports this idea, 
since the Shadowmasters are rumored to have the power to transport 
themselves through shadows.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nybor, Wandering Zulkir of Enchantment:</b><i>+3 defending spell storing dagger</i>; AL NE; Int 19, Wis 12, Cha 17; Speech, telepathy, 120 ft. darkvision, blindsense, and hearing; Ego score 23.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Languages Known:</i> Abyssal, Common, Infernal, Mulhorandi, Thayan; the dagger can read all languages and use <i>read magic</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Lesser Powers:</i> Knowledge (arcana) +14, Knowledge (local -- Thay) +14, Spellcraft +14, <i>detect magic</i> at will. Nybor does not shed light.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Greater Powers:</i><i>Cause fear</i> at will, <i>dismissal</i> 1/day, <i>hold person</i> 3/day.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Description:</i> This dagger looks like a well-crafted <i>terkoum</i>
 (a Thayan ceremonial dagger used in rituals and spellcasting). Its 
black hilt is wrapped tightly in a bright red leather strap and its 
blade is carved with magical symbols. The crossguard has a small icon of
 a woman's face on one side, with diamonds for eyes and a sapphire at 
the center of power on the forehead.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Personality:</i> Nybor, like the Thayan archmage who 
bears the same name, is a cruel and domineering thing, and she enjoys 
using her power over others. (The dagger's physical and mental voice is 
definitely female.) In the hands of someone she considers inferior, she 
quickly uses her powers to drive them to suicide (such as using <i>cause fear</i> when climbing a cliff wall) or cripples them in dangerous situations (such as using <i>hold person</i>
 in a dangerous part of town or in the middle of a fight). She considers
 it beneath herself to be wielded as a weapon and becomes disgusted with
 anyone who suggests it. When carried by someone sympathetic to her 
personality and outlook, she easily slips into a mentoring role, though 
she is still stern and intolerant of negligence, just like a Thayan 
wizard dealing with an apprentice. She gets excited when facing enemy 
wizards, particularly Thayans who specialized in something other than 
enchantment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The origin of the dagger is unknown, and her own 
memories are fuzzy on the subject. She may be an experiment by zulkir 
Nybor to transfer her consciousness into an object to make a like-minded
 ally. She may be the zulkir's attempt at immortality without resorting 
to lichdom (and seeing as she worked with and against Szass Tam when she
 was a zulkir, she knew what lichdom entailed). Perhaps a spell went 
awry in the attack that caused her disappearance and an echo of the dead
 zulkir's mind was trapped in her <i>terkoum</i>. What is certain is 
that the dagger calls herself Nybor, knows personal details of Nybor's 
life that only someone close to her would know, and is well-versed in 
magic and Thayan lore.</p>
