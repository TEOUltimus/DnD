<p align="left"><i>The Wyrm Regent of the North is a benign monarch, but only a fool would test her powers.</i></p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace is a living legend of the North. The Dragon
 Queen of Silverymoon is seldom seen (in her own shape, at least) by 
humans, but many have felt the warmth and aid of her power and decrees. 
With her consort Deszeldaryndun Silverwing, the Guardian Worm of 
Everlund (an adult male silver dragon covered in an earlier "Wyrms of 
the North"), Valamaradace reigns over a domain as absolutely as any 
human ruler. Thankfully for the future of civilization in the North, 
she's chosen to further Alustriel of Silverymoon's dream of the Silver 
Marches by allowing that realm to take in her own domain.</p>
<p align="left">That's not to say the Dragon Queen has renounced her 
self-appointed duties of guardianship over her domain or become a lackey
 of the Silver Marches. Instead, Valamaradace has dedicated herself not 
only to maintaining her personal standards over conditions in her 
domain, but also to continually testing the fledgling realm of the 
Silver Marches, ferreting out deceit and treachery among its rulers and 
agents. For such work, the ancient female gold dragon takes on many 
guises. Her favored form when making one of her rare forays into cities 
is that of Targarda, an agile, diminutive female human possessed of 
"elfin" looks and a little magic; only the Chosen of Mystra and a few 
Harpers know that this beautiful mageling is in truth the Dragon Queen.</p>
<p align="left">When in disguise, Valamaradace considers herself "on 
holiday" so far as surface inclinations and manners are concerned. 
Though she clings always to her goals and views of how the world should 
be, she'll act out a chosen role to the hilt, straying far from her true
 nature in words and apparent actions if need be. When appearing as 
herself, however, she reverts to her own gentle, soft-spoken ways. The 
Dragon Queen quietly and calmly thwarts violence, stops cruelty, and 
rebukes pride and arrogance whenever she encounters it. Often she is 
forced to remind "good" beings that they cheapen themselves when they 
adopt the fierceness, bad graces, and attitudes of the creatures they 
struggle against.</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace did not confer a title on herself; rather, 
it was given to her sometime around 826 DR by the dying Dragon Queen 
Mairogra, a red dragon who'd ruled a domain centered roughly on Everlund
 but hunted vigorously elsewhere. Mairogra was laid low in the end by 
the concerted attacks of many adventurers. Valamaradace came upon the 
mortally wounded Queen and cast the only spell she had that could help 
Mairogra: a <i>painquench</i> magic that made the red dragon's last 
hours easier. Many sages suspect she agreed to act as a monarch because 
nurturing an area of countryside to be "the way she wanted it" is the 
task she most wanted to do, and the way she wanted to spend her life.</p>
<p align="left">The keys to Valamaradace's character are her kindness, 
empathy, and desire to understand the beings she encounters and cater to
 their needs as long as she doesn't harm other living creatures. She 
finds the concepts of traps, vandalism, and wanton destruction 
abhorrent, and she is a foe of arsonists, orc hordes, and others who 
visit destruction upon a whim or for their own pleasure. Prudence for 
the maintenance of her own reputation (and therefore, that of her 
territories) leads her to engage in snooping or fighting in disguise, 
rather than openly as the Dragon Queen. She and her consort are working 
to give the impression that many other dragons besides themselves patrol
 their domain, attacking predators and aiding others in Valamaradace's 
name. They often do this by assuming other forms, and the Dragon Queen 
in particular has become an accomplished mimic. Valamaradace loves 
acting, and her subtle sense of humor comes through when she's "being 
someone else" more than it does when she's playing the role of the 
gently regal Dragon Queen.</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace knows more about the doings of humans, 
humanoids, and other civilized creatures (dismissed by many wyrms as no 
more than loud, swarming "small prey") than almost all other dragons. 
Her desire to understand other beings leads her to converse with them 
and really listen to what they say, remembering almost all of it without
 the distortion wrought by the egos of most dragons.</p>
<p align="left">Her relationships with other wyrms have been, in the 
words of the human sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate (fast becoming 
recognized as an authority on the history of dragons up and down the 
Sword Coast), "a series of avoidances while in dragon form and careful 
observance from disguise. Trust comes slowly to the Dragon Queen -- the 
sole exception is Deszeldaryndun Silverwing, now her consort. He won her
 heart after a courtship that followed on his thrice rescuing her from 
the attacks of other wyrms. Many red dragons down the years have coveted
 the territories Valamaradace now commands, thanks to a legend 
widespread among dragons that claims Mairogra had amassed a half-mile 
deep pit entirely filled with gems." If there ever was any such pit, 
it's been covered over with a deep layer of earth and never sought out 
by the Dragon Queen, and most sources (including both Volo and 
Elminster) agree it probably never existed . . . but its lure remains 
strong.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Valamaradace's Lair</b></p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen and her consort Deszeldaryndun dwell in
 the Floating Mountain. This gigantic, hollow, oval rock is kept aloft 
by the Dragon Queen's magic, which also enshrouds it in mists, and 
directs it wherever she desires. Usually it hovers low over the woods 
due west of Everlund, or south of there on the verges of the High 
Forest. The dragon couple refers to it as "Softwing."</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace inherited Softwing from her predecessor 
Mairogra, who left it in a resting bed of deep sand (a natural sandpit) 
southwest of Everlund when she didn't have it aloft. Old Northern 
legends of wandering children "kidnapped by a dragon who moved its lair 
with them inside" are believed to have stemmed from human encounters 
with the Floating Mountain.</p>
<p align="left">Today, the Floating Mountain looks like a large, mottled
 gray potato riddled with gaping holes. Inside are a series of tunnels 
and chambers with silky smooth walls. Spells concealing "cupboard" holes
 are set high in the caverns, where some treasure -- including magic 
items -- is kept. (In particular, the Dragon Queen seems to delight in 
collecting two sorts of trophies from foes who battle her: magic armor 
and any magic items carried by wizards.) Other spells are known to warn 
the draconic couple from afar if intruders have entered the lair and to 
awaken the equivalent of long-range <i>arcane eye</i> spells that can transmit what they see to Valamaradace no matter how distant from her lair she might be.</p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen keeps no servitor creatures at her lair
 and rarely invites anyone into it, but enemies seeking to sneak in and 
steal have sometimes met Harpers and others waiting to meet 
Valamaradace. These guests vigorously defended the Floating Mountain 
against intrusion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Valamaradace's Domain</b></p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen determines the borders of her domain. 
In recent years its boundaries have changed little. They take in the 
entire Moonwood to the north, running southeast to Sundabar and back 
southwest along the River Rauvin to Turlangtor (westernmost of the rocky
 heights that run south of the river and east to Turnstone Pass). From 
there her domain extends southwest through the Woods of Turlang to the 
Lost Peaks, then west along the Dessarin to a point south of Flint Rock.
 At this point, her border turns to run due north across the Evermoors 
to the River Surbrin, then along its banks back to the northern tip of 
the Moonwood again.</p>
<p align="left">Within this area, Valamaradace tries to change the 
bounty of the land and activities of inhabitants and visitors to her 
will; she and her consort patrol often and watch diligently over 
unfolding events -- and all intrusions. She knows that her work has made
 this area even more attractive to predators (orc hordes, for instance),
 and she is always warily looking for the approach of raiding forces.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Deeds of Valamaradace</b></p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen gathers, grows, and markets (in 
Everlund and Silverymoon) many sorts of food crops, herbs, and their 
seeds in her domain. She maintains several "root cellar" storage caverns
 (their temperature modified by <i>control weather</i> spells) in the 
wilds west of Everlund. A resident colony of sprites guards them against
 depredations by rodents and more intelligent foragers.</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace treats her entire domain as a gigantic 
garden, patrolling its borders and planning how best to tend its growing
 things. Her consort Deszeldaryndun deals with most intruders and 
"civilized" beings within the territory, while Valamaradace sees to 
removing diseased trees and plants, planting new ones, balancing light 
and shade, marsh and dry land, altering drainage, and so on to create as
 lush and stable a land of plenty as she can. She's constantly busy 
"adjusting the balance" of living things and refining her spells to give
 her greater control over the domain. Neutral-aligned beings are 
tolerated as travelers in her territory, but not as settlers; evil 
beings are destroyed or driven out when detected (which has led some 
Harpers and other Good- aligned beings to dub the domain "the Haven"). 
Good creatures discover that though temples and abbeys are few and far 
between, many hermit-priests and other healers dwell in the Dragon 
Queen's domain, and that it's largely free of strife. Wounded and sick 
beings often tarry in the Haven to recover.</p>
<p align="left">Valamaradace uses her skills and gifts for the benefit 
of all so that none might go hungry or needy in the Haven. Beings who 
misuse her bounty, however, to laze away their days in her domain 
expecting free food and handouts are visited by superiors, creditors, or
 their agents (sent by the Dragon Queen), to be "sent back to productive
 tasks."</p>

<p align="left">*Valamaradace has a feat (exact benefits and 
prerequisites unknown) that allows her to take some druid spells as 
arcane spells in the same manner that gold dragons may select spells 
from the Good, Law, and Luck domains as arcane spells.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, 
Valamaradace can breathe a 60-foot cone of fire or weakening gas. Each 
creature in the area takes 20d10 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 36 
half) or 10 points of Strength damage (Fortitude DC 36 half).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Crush (Ex):</b> Whenever Valamaradace flies or jumps,
 she can land on opponents as a standard action, using her whole body to
 crush them. Her crush attack affects Large or smaller opponents within a
 20-foot-by-20-foot area. Each potentially affected creature must 
succeed on a DC 36 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+24
 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon 
moves off. If Valamaradace chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a 
normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each 
round if they don't escape. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b> Whenever Valamaradace 
attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature in a 300-foot radius 
that has 34 or fewer HD must make a DC 36 Will save. Failure indicates 
that the creature is panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it has 4 or fewer HD) 
or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or more HD).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>bless; </i>1/day -- <i>geas/quest, sunburst</i> (DC 27). Caster level 15th.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spells:</b> Valamaradace casts spells as a 15th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tail Sweep (Ex):</b> Valamaradace can sweep with her 
tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a 
30-foot radius extending from an intersection on the edge of her space 
in any direction. Each small or smaller creature in the swept area takes
 2d6+24 points of damage (Reflex DC 36 half).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> Valamaradace can assume any 
animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a standard action 
three times per day. This ability functions as a <i>polymorph</i> spell 
cast on herself (caster level 15th), except that she does not regain hit
 points for changing form and can assume only the form of an animal or 
humanoid. The dragon can remain in her animal or humanoid form until she
 chooses to assume a new one or return to her natural form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blindsense (Ex): </b>Valamaradace can pinpoint 
creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents she can't actually see
 still have total concealment against her.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Detect Gems </i>(Sp):</b>This divination effect is similar to a <i>detect magic</i>
 spell, except that it finds only gems. Valamaradace can scan a 
60-degree arc each round. By concentrating for 1 round, she can 
determine whether there are any gems within the arc; 2 rounds of 
concentration reveal the exact number of gems; and 3 rounds reveal their
 exact location, type, and value. This ability is the equivalent of a 
2nd-level spell, and Valamaradace can use it three times per day.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Valamaradace can see four times
 as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal 
light. She also has darkvision to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Luck Bonus </i>(Sp):</b> Once per day, 
Valamaradace can touch a gem, usually one embedded in her hide, and 
enspell it to bring good luck. As long as she carries the gem, she and 
every good creature in a 100-foot radius receives a +1 luck bonus on all
 saving throws and similar rolls, as if she had a <i>stone of good luck </i>(see the item description in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>).
 If she gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer 
gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3+30 hours but ends if the gem is 
destroyed. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b> Valamaradace can breathe 
water as easily as she can air. She is fully at home underwater, and she
 takes no penalties there (as if under the effect of a <i>freedom of movement</i> spell).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/9/8/8/8/8/7/5; save DC 19 + spell level): 0 -- <i>detect magic, detect poison, disrupt undead, light, mage hand, message, ray of frost, read magic, resistance; </i>1st -- <i>alarm, ironguts </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>know protections</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>painquench</i> (exact effects unknown, possibly similar to the <i>rosemantle</i> spell from <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>shield; </i>2nd -- <i>alter self, cat's grace, invisibility, soften earth and stone, wood shape;</i> 3rd -- <i>diminish plants, plant growth, slow, suggestion; </i>4th -- <i>arcane eye, dimension door, freedom of movement, holy smite; </i>5th -- <i>dispel chaos, Mestil's acid sheath</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>mind fog, transmute rock to mud; </i>6th -- <i>greater dispel magic, mislead, prismatic eye</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>); 7th -- <i>greater scrying, Presper's spell matrix</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Valamaradace's Magic</b></p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen wields an impressive roster of spells, but they pale beside the most powerful item at her disposal, the <i>crown of the mountain</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Crown of the Mountain: </b>This ancient artifact 
appears as a crown or spike-studded circlet of rough, unadorned stone 
that can't be shattered by any known means. It alters to fit the brow 
(or wrist, or tail) of its wearer and seems immune to most spell effects
 (and all divinations and destructive magics thus far applied to it).</p>
<p align="left">The true origin of the crown is in dispute. Some say it 
was a gift of the dwarven gods to their people, others that it was yet 
another powerful tool devised by a Netherese sorcerer-king, and there 
are even some who hold to the view that it was brought to Toril from 
some other world, suffering the loss of its primary purpose and some of 
its greatest powers in the process.</p>
<p align="left"><b>History</b></p>
<p align="left">The first reliable record of the crown (as opposed to 
the disputed, fanciful tales of it being bestowed upon mortals by 
various gods, or worn by a Netherese archwizard as he went down fighting
 a titanic spell-battle against over forty hostile mages) occurs in 
three separate adventurers' diaries, all of which mention a 
hitherto-unknown wizard by the name of Larbrand "from southern lands" 
who used the crown in a quarry in the Tashalar circa 336 DR. The writers
 hailed from different cities around the Shining Sea; their attribution 
of a more southerly origin for Larbrand has led many to think he came 
from Halruaa or perhaps even Zakhara. The truth is now lost; even 
Larbrand's fate is unknown, beyond his later encounter with the sage 
Hoarmandar, whose description of the crown is Elminster's main source.</p>
<p align="left">What is certain is that two dwarven scouts exploring the
 Underdark near Chessenta in 523 DR (they reported "a realm of spiders" 
and similar unpleasantnesses thereabouts) met with a human merchant, one
 Urabbastrar Tholokh, who was busily using the crown to carve out 
ever-larger storage cellars, with plans of perhaps establishing a mine 
if he could find an ore-vein. Horrified at the thoughtlessly large and 
unstable cuttings Tholokh had already made, the dwarves agreed to steal 
the crown away from him -- even if they had to slay him on the spot to 
get it. A few breaths later, Tholokh broke through into an existing 
cavern and was swarmed over by carrion crawlers so numerous and so 
energetic that the dwarves were forced to flee. When they dared return, 
days later, the dwarves found no sign of whence the human had gone.</p>
<p align="left">The crown surfaced once more, this time in 811 DR, where
 it came into the possession of the Dragon Queen Mairogra. A priest of 
Talos was using it to hollow out a pinnacle-shaped island in the 
Nelanther to create a large temple-citadel. Unfortunately, he either 
stumbled upon or attracted the attention of someone or something 
magically powerful, and one night lightning rained "down into the sea 
like white, crackling fingers" from the sky. In the morning, the temple 
was no longer a pinnacle of rock, but only a few drowned fingers jutting
 out of the rolling waves . . . and the crown was hidden again.</p>
<p align="left">How the first Dragon Queen acquired it remains a 
mystery, as are its original purpose and possible additional, related 
powers -- and Valamaradace shows no interest in seeking these out or 
letting anyone experiment with or even touch the stone circlet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Campaign Use: </b>The crown does possess other powers
 not revealed here; Valamaradace is aware of some, but not how to access
 or control them -- and will never do so, since certain of these powers 
can be awakened only by wearing the Crown in the right location (ruins 
outside the Dragon Queen's domain) and undertaking the proper processes.
 It's rumored among sages who study such things that Candlekeep and even
 some far humbler libraries might hold hints of the procedure. It's also
 rumored that the Crown can control other items besides the Floating 
Mountain, including certain "floating" ruins or downed flying ships, 
castles, or even cities. At least one lorebook warns that using the 
Crown for such purposes forever changes the mind of the user or brings 
him under the fell influence of some ancient, malignant sentience.</p>
<p align="left">Any being(s) wearing, holding, or directly touching the <i>crown of the mountain</i>
 can withstand (ignoring all damage and effects) all natural and magical
 forces that normally do harm due to extremes of temperature, 
precipitation, and wind. For instance, a wearer could walk normally into
 a gale-force opposing wind, breathing and conducting feats of careful 
manual dexterity (such as writing a note) where others would be swept 
away or reduced to clinging helplessly to a rock or other immovable 
object.</p>
<p align="left">The crown also protects its wearer from being buried, 
struck, or injured in any way by the impact or weight of stone missiles 
(even magic ones), avalanches, rockslides, and deliberately-telekinesed 
or dropped rocks, including sand, mud, and gravel. It surrounds the 
wearer with an aura of protection that is only about 2 inches deep but 
turns aside even stone spears, fired stone-headed ballista bolts, shards
 of rock from explosions only feet away from the crown-wearer, and even 
collisions between the wearer's falling, flying, or hurled body and 
jagged stone spars. This can allow a crown-wearer to deliberately leap 
off a cliff and land without taking any falling damage -- so long as 
that landing is on rocks. The magic of this item allows even a bound and
 blindfolded wearer to land without harm on rocks upright and on "safe" 
footing . . . even if that footing is a tiny ledge on the face of a 
cliff, or a pinnacle with empty space on all sides. If such a perch 
collapses into an avalanche, the magic of the crown keeps its wearer 
"riding" the avalanche without being buried and can bring him or her to 
any number of other "safe standings" during the slide, if circumstances 
(not the deliberate will of the wearer) call upon it to do so.</p>
<p align="left">The crown has many powers that can be activated as a 
standard action. Some of its powers are categorized as "limited" and 
others are "unlimited." Activating any power automatically ends any 
active "limited" effect, while "unlimited" are not affected and can have
 multiple activated at once.</p>
<p align="left">The limited powers are as follows: 6/day -- <i>greater teleport</i>, <i>stone shape</i>; 3/day -- <i>telekinesis</i>, 2/day -- <i>move earth</i>, <i>stone tell</i>; 1/day -- <i>control weather</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>invisibility</i>.</p>
<p align="left">The unlimited powers are: At will -- <i>focal stone</i> (see below), <i>greater levitate</i> (see below). Through the use of these two spells, the Dragon Queen keeps the Floating Mountain aloft.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Curse:</b> Any creature of less than 8 Hit Dice or 
levels who attempts to invoke a power of the crown (as opposed to merely
 benefiting from its "constant" properties) is affected as if by an <i>imprisonment</i> spell for 1d6 years. (The crown falls to the ground, and the user vanishes into the earth, trapped until a <i>freedom</i>
 spell is properly cast on the spot or the curse expires, whereupon the 
earth returns the being to where the user was standing when the curse 
took effect.)</p>
<p align="left">Any being who invokes the <i>control weather</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>greater levitate</i>, or <i>telekinesis</i> powers of the crown must immediately make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 22) or be affected by a <i>hold monster</i>
 spell (heightened to 9th-level and made persistent) for 24 hours. The 
being's intellect and senses remain unaffected, and both the power 
invoked and other crown powers remain under the being's control, insofar
 as the being can function while immobile and unable to speak. Removal 
of the crown from a paralyzed being doesn't end the paralyzation, and 
neither does any attack affecting a paralyzed crown-wearer, but 
attacking that being after the crown has been removed ends the paralysis
 instantly.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Suggested Means of Destruction</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>crown of the mountain</i> melts away harmlessly if cast into a flow of molten volcanic rock and then targeted by six <i>disintegrate</i> spells simultaneously.<br><br></li>
<li>The crown can be crushed by the blow of any hammer or tool with an 
enhancement bonus of at least +1 if struck while on an altar dedicated 
to Grumbar or any dwarven or gnome deity. A furious release of wild 
magic accompanies such a passing.<br><br></li>
<li>The crown can be destroyed by enclosing it together with no less 
than six earth elementals inside a sphere of magical force (several 
spells afford usable barriers; only trial and error can determine which 
dweomers are insufficient), then causing the sphere to dwindle to a 
fist-sized or smaller extent. This results in an explosion in which the 
elementals perish, wild magic is hurled forth in all directions, and the
 ground and immediate surroundings are shattered, pulverized, or hurled 
away. The blast deals 20d6 points of force damage to all creatures 
within a 60-foot radius (no saving throw). Elementals and objects take 
double damage.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Strong (conjuration, transmutation); CL 22nd;Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Focal Stone<br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target:</b> One clear or translucent gemstone up to 1 inch in diameter (see text)<br><b>Duration:</b> Permanent until discharged<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (object)<br><b>Spell Resistance: </b>Yes (object)</p>
<p align="left">You transform the target gem so it is capable of storing magic in the manner of an attuned gem (see the Attune Gem feat in <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>).
 On your next turn, you or another spellcaster can cast a spell into the
 gem, transforming it into an attuned gem (as if it had been crafted 
with the Attune Gem feat). The gem and spell must meet all the criteria 
of the Attune Gem feat and gem magic. The person casting the spell to be
 stored must spend XP as if a potion were being created with the Attune 
Gem feat.</p>
<p align="left">Unlike the Attune Gem feat, using this spell causes the 
gem to glow with a soft internal radiance (insufficient to light an area
 but enough to notice the gem in a shadowy or dark room). Also, the only
 way to release the stored spell is to shatter the gem (a standard 
action). A successful <i>dispel magic</i> against your caster level causes this spell and the stored spell to dissipate harmlessly.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component:</i> A pinch of any sort of opal dust.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Levitate, Greater<br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Target:</b> You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 1,000 lb./level)</p>

<p align="left"><b>Valamaradace's Fate</b></p>
<p align="left">The Dragon Queen is too tempting a target to avoid 
attacks from evil Faerûnians who are truly mighty in magic. Elminster 
foresees a grim future for her but pledges that he and the Seven will do
 what they can to see that "her shining presence remains as long as 
possible."</p>
