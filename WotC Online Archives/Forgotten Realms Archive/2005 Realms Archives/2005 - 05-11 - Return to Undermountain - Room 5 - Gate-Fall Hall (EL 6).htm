<p align="LEFT"><b>Disable Device <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 20: </b>It's unlikely a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">PC</a> will have the time or inclination to make this <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_check')">check</a>, but a result this high allows the PC to jam the portcullis trap open, assuming it's open at the time the check is made.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Escape Artist DC 30: </b>A PC who succeeds to this 
degree on an Escape Artist check can squeeze through the bars of the 
portcullis trap. See the squeezing rules on page 148 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. A <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Tiny')">Tiny</a> or smaller creature can automatically squeeze through the bars. A <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Large')">Large</a> or larger creature cannot move through the bars.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Listen DC 5: </b>The PCs don't make this check. When 
they come within the hall-residing kobold's sight, he screams, and the 
kobolds in Area B make a Listen check to hear him so that they can set 
their trap in motion.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Listen DC 6: </b>A kobold sits in the hall to the 
south, nattering absentmindedly to itself in Draconic as it waits for 
someone to come through the door. If the PCs make Listen checks outside 
the door before opening it, increase the DC by +5. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Listen DC 17: </b>The kobolds in Area B are chatting 
in Draconic while they wait for someone to fall into their trap. If the 
PCs make Listen checks outside the door before entering, increase the DC
 by another +5. If a PC hears the noise, it seems to the PC like it's 
coming through the southwest corner of Area A.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Search DC 10: </b>A Search check with this result can
 reveal the holes through which the portcullis bars fall, although if 
the PC does not have the trapfinding ability, he does not necessarily 
know their purpose.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Search DC 20: </b>Getting this result on a Search 
check allows the PC to discover the secret door in the south wall of 
Area A. The door can be opened simply by pushing. It swings both ways 
easily but with a loud squeaking noise as it turns on its rusted pins.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spot DC 16:</b> A PC standing under where the 
portcullises fall can spot the small holes in the ceiling that the bars 
drop through or the holes in the floor that they fit in when fallen. A 
PC making the check from a distance suffers the normal <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalties</a>,
 so the effective DC to see the holes of the first portcullis for a PC 
standing just inside the door would be 24. PCs charging or running down 
the hall after the kobold should not be allowed to make a Spot check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Speak Language (Draconic) DC --</b>: A PC who speaks Draconic can understand the kobolds when they talk to one another.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> DC 10:</b> This result allows a PC to aid another (granting a +2 bonus) in the following Strength checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Strength DC 24:</b> This check result allows a PC to bend one of the iron bars. This give PCs trying to move through the bars a +5 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> on their Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Strength DC 30:</b> A Strength check this high allows a PC to break one of the iron bars free from its moorings. This allows any PC up to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a> size to squeeze through the bars without the need of an Escape Artist check. See the squeezing rules on page 148 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Alternatively, a PC who makes a Strength check to lift 
the portcullis and gets this result can actually lift a portcullis into 
the ceiling (causing both of them to rise), but the portcullises remain 
up only if the PC continues to make the check on the following rounds or
 the lever is pulled up. A PC who loses her grip on the raised bars or 
intentionally lets go without them being secured is attacked by the trap
 as the portcullises come down again. Note that if a bar is bent by the 
PCs, the portcullises can't be lifted until the bar is bent straight 
again.</p>

<p align="LEFT">This encounter works best with a party a level or two below the EL. Large area-affecting spells such as <i>fireball</i> can make short work of the kobold warriors, so it's best to spring this trap on 4th-level characters.</p>

and a long hall leading into the darkness to the south. A puddle in the

 the dungeon. As you glance about the room, you hear something from the 
darkness of the southern corridor. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The PC should make a Listen check at this point. See the Relevant Checks sidebar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs are about to walk into a trap. A group of 
kobolds has claimed this area of the dungeons after learning how to use a
 secret door and a portcullis trap in the halls. The puddle in the 
northeastern corner of the room (Area A) is kobold urine micturated by 
the kobold sitting on the floor in the corridor to the south (K). The 
kobold is absentmindedly talking to itself in Draconic about its allies 
and how he hates having to stay in the hall while they relax. When the 
PCs enter, the kobold hears the door and prepares himself to stand up 
and run, but he doesn't get up until he can see the PCs since he's not 
certain the door opening isn't one of his fellows playing a trick on 
him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a PC comes within range of his darkvision, the 
kobold screams and stands up. At this point, you should ask the players 
to roll <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a>. Roll initiative for the kobold in the hall separately from those in Area B.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The kobold in the hall has a job to do: He must wail 
pathetically and run to the south, luring the PCs after him and alerting
 the kobolds on the other side of the wall that the trap should be set 
in motion. The kobolds in Area B should make DC 5 Listen checks to hear 
their fellow in screaming in the hall. Assuming they do, half of them 
run to the south and the other half run to the secret door that leads 
into Area A.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The kobolds' plan is simple: Allow some or all of the 
PCs to move between the portcullises and then pull the lever that 
activates the trap. Then the kobolds in Area A mob any stragglers and 
both groups shoot crossbows at PCs between the portcullises. They even 
have a table looted from another room that they can push into the 
corridor from the south and use as <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cover')">cover</a>.
 The tricky part, of course, is the timing. The kobold in the hall runs 
to the south, stopping to turn around just after he passes under the 
second portcullis. If attacked by the PCs before that point, he does his
 best to get out of the hall before his fellows drop the portcullises. 
The kobolds heading south from Area B can run and reach the lever (and 
pull it) in 2 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">rounds</a>.
 (One pulls it while the others grab the table and start moving it into 
the hall.) The kobolds heading through the secret door get to it with a 
single move and then Listen to see if the PCs have run down the hall (DC
 10 Listen Check assuming the PC aren't attempting to move silently). If
 the PCs wish to use their Move Silently skills, the DC of the Listen 
check is opposed by the Move Silently result as explained in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 on page 79, though the Listen check DC has a modifier of +10. If the 
kobolds don't hear the PCs, one opens the door on the following round 
and they flood in to attack anyone not caught in the trap.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Portcullis Trap: </b>CR 1; mechanical; lever trigger; manual reset; <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">Atk</a> +10 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee</a> (3d6, piercing); Search DC 10; Disable Device DC 20.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The two portcullises fall at the same time when a lever 
is pulled. Each trap attacks any creatures in the squares below it when 
the lever is pulled. A PC attacked by a portcullis must then decide 
which side of the portcullis to end up on, north or south, since the 
portcullis blocks movement through the hall. (Of course, a PC killed or 
rendered dying by the trap doesn't make it to one side or the other.) 
Pulling the lever doesn't require a Strength check. Clever PCs might use
 a <i>mage hand</i> spell on the lever, causing the portcullises to 
immediately rise, but the kobolds send them crashing down again at the 
earliest opportunity.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each iron bar of the portcullis has a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hardness')">hardness</a> of 10 and 60 hit points. The bars are about 6 inches apart. See Relevant Checks for more information.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kobold Skirmishers (9):</b> See page 161 of the <i>Monster Manual</i> or use the statistics for the Kobold Skirmisher (35/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965830000">Dragoneye</a></i> miniature set. The kobolds are armed with masterwork light crossbows for Small characters, giving them a +4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attack</a> that deals 1d6 points of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>.
 Note that some of the kobolds might take cover behind corners or behind
 the table in the south. Also, keep in mind the range of the kobolds' 
darkvision when making ranged attacks (unless the PCs carry a light 
source). Six kobold skirmishers head south. Three head north with the 
kobold soldiers and kobold champion.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kobold Soldiers (2):</b> These kobolds are 2nd-level fighters. Use Table 4-16 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 and the advice on page 127 of that book to generate the kobold fighters
 or use the statistics for the Kobold Soldier (44/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966990000">Angelfire</a></i> miniature set. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kobold Champion (1):</b> This kobold is a 4th-level fighter. Use Table 4-16 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 and the advice on page 127 of that book to generate the kobold fighter 
or use the statistics for the Kobold Champion (37/60) from the <i>Aberrations</i>
 miniature set {{link href="/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966240000"}}.
 This is the kobolds' leader and the two soldiers are his lieutenants. 
As long as he is alive, the kobolds are unwilling to retreat, but should

<ul>
<li>The kobolds aren't interested in making <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_coupdegrace')">coup de grace</a>
 attacks. They just want to take the PCs' gear. If the PCs fall to the 
encounter, another band of adventurers might hear the ruckus and arrive 
in time to drive off the kobolds and heal the PCs. Then the PCs can 
track the kobolds to their lair and, with the help of the NPCs, regain 
their stolen gear.<br><br></li>
<li> This encounter becomes more dangerous if another monster lays the 
trap. Consider replacing the kobolds with goblins, orcs, hobgoblins, or 
bugbears.</li>

<p align="left"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
