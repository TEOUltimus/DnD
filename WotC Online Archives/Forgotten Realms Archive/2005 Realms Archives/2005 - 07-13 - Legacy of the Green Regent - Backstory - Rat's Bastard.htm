<p align="right"><i>The orc should have been executed. Mercy is a 
virtue, but Haargh slew one of Loudwater's finest, cutting the guard in 
half with his axe. I knew the guard since he was a boy. His name was 
Rendell. He hadn't even drawn his sword when Haargh killed him. The orc 
was given exile. It should have been death.</i></p>
<p align="right">Teseryne Truesilver<br> Daughter of Talanthe Truesilver<br> Year of Rogue Dragons</p>
<p align="left">Violence begat violence one night at the Red Boar 
Tavern. Two orcs were killed in the alley out back and passions were 
running high. An orc named Haargh led a group of his fellow orcs to the 
tavern. His brother had been one of those killed, and he wanted 
vengeance.</p>
<p align="left">As I mentioned in my previous tales, High Lord Kalahar 
Twohands had issued the Decree of Reception, which allowed the orcs into
 Loudwater. Not everyone in town agreed with this Decree, and orcs often
 get a cold reception when in town. The Red Fellowship and their leader 
Stedd Rein are particularly vocal in their disagreement with the Decree.
 Kalahar knew of the trouble at the Red Boar and posted two guards at 
the inn to keep the peace.</p>
<p align="left">So, when Haargh kicked the door to the inn down, one of 
the guards, Rendell, was there and tried to stop him saying, "The High 
Lord wants no trouble here." The orc snarled, "The High Lord can rot!" 
and killed Rendell with a single blow of his axe. Chaos erupted as the 
other orcs moved into the tavern to butcher everyone inside.</p>
<p align="left">A massacre was prevented by the quick action of the 
Order of the Jade Blade, who happened to be at the Red Boar that night. 
They interposed themselves between the orcs and the panicking patrons 
and calmed Haargh down enough to talk. They learned that he was upset 
about his brother's death, and how no one in town seemed to be doing 
anything about it. They learned that he blamed the humans at the Red 
Boar for the deaths, especially the Red Fellowship. The Jade Blade 
managed to get Haargh to back down by promising to look into the 
murders. Haargh gave them three days or he would torch the Red Boar 
Tavern to the ground.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade began their investigation the next day. 
They spoke with Fist Keshel of the Loudwater Guard, who told them that 
there were eight murders in all and they were all within two blocks of 
the Red Boar Tavern. She had only lead she had – a drunk named Hookus 
who claimed that the murderers were a drow and a demon dog.</p>
<p align="left">About this time, a strange boy from the Ivy Enclave 
approached the Jade Blade. The Ivy Enclave is the local Thayan Enclave 
and has been here for decades. Misban Rensha signed the original treaty 
when he married Thola of Thay (The Jade Blade found her tomb under the 
High Lord's Hall). When Nanathlar Greysword overthrew Pasuuk Rensha, he 
allowed the Red Wizards to stay on the condition that no Red Wizard 
within Loudwater could own a slave. However, there is more to this tale 
than just that. The Red Wizards aided Nanathlar in his rebellion, and 
the continued existence of the enclave was the price.</p>
<p align="left">The boy beckoned the adventurers to follow him to the 
Ivy Enclave, where they met with Beyvan Keth, the leader of the Thayans.
 Keth revealed the true culprit of the orc murders – a half drow named 
Dusk who could be found in the Duelists' Grotto. He asked for no 
payment, but did request that the adventurers not reveal his role. How 
do I know what was said at this secret meeting? I was there when Keth 
aided Nanathlar, and there is a lot more to the tale than is commonly 
known. More than that, I will not say.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade went in search for Dusk. Their inquiries 
attracted the attention of Sparrot the Jack. Sparrot provoked one of the
 adventures into a duel. When he was bested, Sparrot revealed that Dusk 
stayed at an old bath house called the Steam House, which was being used
 as the hideout for a gang affiliated with the Hark called the Rat 
Bastards.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade approached and found that they were 
expected. It turns out that Sparrot was part of the gang and he had 
warned them of the adventurers' approach. A halfling member of the Rat 
Bastards posed as the receptionist and allowed the freeswords into the 
Steam House. He showed them into the steam room where Dusk waited for 
them. Sparrot and the halfling joined the battle, attacking the 
freeswords from behind.</p>
<p align="left">The battle was a difficult one and a few of the 
adventurers were bleeding on the ground before it was done, but they 
slew the Rat Bastards. In the subsequent search of the Steam House, they
 found a secret passage leading down into the Earth. Down there, they 
met the "Harkson".</p>
<p align="left">Lazurak Harkson turned out to be a barghest, which is a 
demon from the Abyss that takes a goblin form when on Toril. It had 
aligned itself with the Hark because that gave it plenty of opportunity 
to kill and spread chaos. It immediately attacked the Jade Blade, 
revealing its demonic nature when it turned into a demonic wolf. Again, 
the freeswords faced a tough foe but emerged victorious.</p>
<p align="left">Once the Harkson was slain, the Jade Blade discovered 
evidence that it was the one behind the murders. The Harkson liked to 
take trophies, and it had collected bits and pieces from each of its 
kills. The Jade Blade gathered up the trophies and carried them back to 
Kalahar to show him what was behind the murders. </p>
<p align="left">They even spoke at Haargh's trial, and their testimony 
was crucial for the decision that he be given exile instead of death. I 
can understand why they did this, but I cannot agree with it. Haargh 
killed Rendell in cold blood. Anger, no matter how justified, does not 
excuse murder.</p>
