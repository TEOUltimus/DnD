<p align="left"><b>What Smites the Eye in Uthmere</b></p>
<p align="left">Most visitors see Uthmere as a tidy city of stone, beset
 by clinging damp (and nightly fogs) and all the usual smells of a port,
 but having less noise, stink, and open street refuse than most cities.</p>
<p align="left">Uth streets are cobbled rather than dirt, buildings are 
of fieldstone, and roofs are of slate or tile. The slate and tile can 
become deadly missiles in high winds, so they're inspected often by the 
Cudgels, who use a wagon akin to a scaffold on wheels; they can levy 
heavy fines if a roof is found in poor repair, so most "househars" 
(homeowners) find it cheaper and easier to pay for whatever repair work 
they claim is necessary, which the Cudgels do on the spot.[<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rl/20050914a#1">1</a>]
 Aside from stables (which have tall lofts used for hay and for rearing 
clipped-wing pigeons for eggs and as eating-fowl), all buildings in 
Uthmere rise at least three floors above the street since only shallow 
cellars are possible.[<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rl/20050914a#2">2</a>]</p>
<p align="left">Firefighting is unknown in Uthmere, but thanks to the 
damp, local building materials, and the lack of "common walls" 
(buildings that touch must both have unbroken end walls, with no beams 
or roofs spanning the join), fires that spread beyond a single building 
are rare.</p>
<p align="left">Uth buildings usually have small, narrow "light-slit" 
windows at ground level. Higher windows often sport iron-bar gratings to
 prevent stealthy entry. The gratings are slid into channels on inside 
walls and pinned there with metal "stops" that pierce a hole in the 
grating frame and pass on into a cavity bored in the stone of the wall. <i>All</i> Uth windows have stout wooden weather shutters.</p>
<p align="left">Balconies are found only on third floors and higher, and
 they tend to be metal-framed, with wood or metal slats. They're 
typically used to grow shragga (leaf lettuce) and other vegetables and 
herbs, and sometimes to hang wet washing (outside exposure only rarely 
truly dries anything in Uthmere).</p>
<p align="left">Building roofs tend to be steeply pitched to shed snow 
and rain, with corner downspouts draining into channels along the sides 
of streets. (Anyone entering or leaving a building steps between raised 
doorsill and raised cobbles over a water-run channel.)</p>
<p align="left">The tallest, grandest private buildings in the city (the
 hightowers of the wealthy) are found in northeasternmost Uthmere, nigh 
the Lords' Park, in a neighborhood imaginatively called Hightowers.</p>
<p align="left">The prevailing Uth weather is dominated by winds blowing onshore out of the northwest, straight into the mouth of the harbor.[<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rl/20050914a#3">3</a>]</p>
<p align="left">Uthmere, the shore around it, and the Dalestream for 
about the same distance as the width of the city upstream of Uthmere, 
experience nightly sea mists (fogs). These sea mists cling to the 
surface of the water and rise up to about 8 feet above it. As a result, 
the highest parts of the city (Southgate Square and the northern half of
 Northstream Uthmere) are above the mists, and the rest of the city is 
shrouded in it.[<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rl/20050914a#4">4</a>]</p>
<p align="left">Uth-folk habitually drive off damp and chill with fires 
and with stones and metal "irons" (large blocks of base metal fashioned 
with handles) that, with the aid of heavy gloves, can be carried to beds
 and to other rooms of a house. They also use "thurls."[<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rl/20050914a#5">5</a>]</p>
<p align="left">Winter means wet snow or slush in Uthmere; 
"slip-everywhere" ice coatings are frequent but short-lived. The cobbles
 of Uth streets have a smooth side and a rough side, and are turned 
rough side up when winter freezes start, and back again at full thaw.</p>
<p align="left">Uth-folk dress heavily against the damp, typically 
wearing leathers or woolens, often with hide breeches and vests. 
Waist-belts are usual for both genders and are always adorned with 
pouches, satchels, and small belt knives. (There's no law against going 
about armed in Uthmere.) If this makes them too heavy to stay up, 
diagonal baldrics are worn. Almost everyone wears boots or thick wooden 
clogs over leggings, and in their homes (and in many city inns and 
clubs, too) they don slippers to pad about on thick braided rugs laid on
 the floors for warmth. Many Uth-folk carry stout clubs (that double as 
walking sticks in times of winter ice, or when infirmity demands) to 
deal with rats.</p>
<p align="left">As overgarments, rain-shedding greased or oiled caps and
 cloaks are common. In every season but summer, knitted fingerless 
gloves are worn, with leather overgauntlets for those who must toil in 
the cold wet.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Footnotes</i></p>
<p align="left"><a name="1"></a>1. The fine for "blowndowns" is 4 sp per
 slate or tile, or "fragment thereof as large in any one dimension as 
the length of a man's hand." For any fineable blowndown that strikes a 
citizen (visitors don't count for purposes of this law), fines are 
doubled and an additional "harm price" of 1 gp is payable to the injured
 party.</p>
<p align="left">Untied dogs, street blockages due to goods or unattended
 conveyances (from huge wagons to small toy carts, which can be falling 
hazards), and throwing <i>anything</i> at anyone (or any beast) also attract Cudgel fines.</p>
<p align="left">The Lord's court can levy penalties upon conviction 
(amounts at the Lord's whim), but "Cudgel fines" are payable on the 
spot, without trial. Folk who can't readily pay are "written up," and 
the document (officially called a "vaerance," but known in the streets 
as a "bloodsheet") that is handed them is a statement of the fine, date,
 and reason. It includes the name of the Cudgel levying the fine. 
Amounts carried on a bloodsheet for more than six months are expunged by
 seizure of goods, and anyone "under a vaerance" (owing anything) can't 
legally leave Uthmere.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="2"></a>2. Deep cellars do exist, and from time 
to time they see use as a place to hide the bodies of murder victims or 
as temporary live storage for edible fish or other seafood, but they're 
largely abandoned for the same reason new ones aren't dug: persistent 
flooding. Cellars pumped dry tend to be useless for storage or 
habitation because of slimy molds thriving on the damp stone. "High 
ground" Uthmere (roughly, the northern half of Northstream Uthmere, and 
that part of Southstream Uthmere covered by Southgate Square) stands on a
 thin layer of heavy clay, overlying bedrock. The rest of Uthmere stands
 on "loose ooze," which is a variable-depth layer of river silt atop 
bedrock.</p>
<p align="left">Extensive deep cellars are carved out of solid rock in 
three places in Uthmere: a granary cellar maintained by the lordlain 
under Southgate Square for the welfare of the city (foodstuffs to keep 
Uth-folk alive in the event of famine, siege, or if outside-world trade 
must be suspended due to plague); the Lord's private storage cellars 
(and armory and garrison granary) under the walled compound that 
contains the Lord's Palace; and beneath certain private homes and 
businesses along the northernmost edge of Uthmere.</p>
<p align="left">The entrances to all of these are secret, and it's an 
offense punishable by death to cause the construction of any cellar that
 endangers the stability of an adjacent building or any part of the city
 walls (including the walls separating the Lord's compound from the rest
 of Uthmere), or any cellar or tunnel connecting the city inside the 
walls to anywhere outside the walls.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="3"></a>3. This means sailing into the harbor is
 usually easy, provided one has means for fend-poling (using long spars 
to push off against the breakwater, to avoid being driven against it).</p>
<p align="left">Leaving again, however (except during the calm that 
usually comes at nightfall), is often a matter of hard rowing, 
fend-poling, and "paying the Lord" a stiff 10 gp fee for his oxen. The 
oxen walk the breakwater trail with their handlers and pull a ship along
 to the end of the breakwater, where it can be cast free.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="4"></a>4. The mists occur because the warming 
of the stone "heat sink" of the city (by fires, other human activities, 
and sunlight on the stones), added to the warmth of decomposition in the
 Dalestream-mouth silt, always makes Uthmere warmer than the Easting 
Reach waters driven onshore by winds.</p>
<p align="left"><a name="5"></a>5. Thurls are small metal tripod 
braziers: bowls whose affixed legs hold them about 6 inches off the 
large, flat safestones they stand on. They are capped with conical metal
 hoods pierced with a ring of small apertures to let air in and warmth 
out; perfumed charcoal and small handfuls of kindling (sometimes scented
 with dried handfuls of fragrant Great Dale grasses) are burned in 
thurls. Though they're usually lit only when a room is occupied, every 
room in the dwelling of well-to-do Uthmaar will have its handy thurl, 
tinderbox, and supply of "longfingers" (tar-soaked-ended long thorns, 
straws, or split "fingers" of wood). Large shop rooms and grand chambers
 will have several, but scented oils or rings of candles are burned in 
open braziers during feasts and special occasions. Deep inverted cone 
iron braziers are used, with a floating wick for the oil, or for the 
candles either a huge central candle, or a ring of smaller ones mounted 
around the lip of the brazier, so their wax runs down into the central 
well for later recovery.</p>
<p align="left">A typical bare brazier of this type costs from 1 to 5 sp
 depending on size and style (decoration and ornamentation), and thurls 
likewise run from 2 to 6 sp. Swung as a weapon, a thurl does 1d2 damage 
(1d2+2 if hot) and a brazier 1d3 (1d3+2 if hot).</p>
