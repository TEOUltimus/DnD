Take a look at <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/950037400">Fantastic Locations: Fane of the Drow</a></i> from the <b>D&amp;D</b> Fantastic Locations series and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/884467400">Sons of Gruumsh</a>,</i> a <b>Forgotten Realms</b> campaign supplement and adventure. <i>Fane of the Drow </i>is
 a 16-page adventure booklet with battle maps, and DMs can combine the 
encounters within the product if they want a short adventure for four 
4th-level characters. Those using miniatures will enjoy the product 
since the battle maps are at the correct scale. As for <i>Sons of Gruumsh,</i> it is a longer adventure for four 4th-level characters, and it occurs in the Moonsea region of the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 setting. The excerpts below include information from the beginning of 
each book so that you can get a better idea of what you'll find inside 
each product. Warning: Adventure spoilers are ahead, so ask your 
friendly neighborhood DM to read further on your behalf. </p>

<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p align="left">This 16-page adventure booklet contains several challenging encounters that can be combined to form a short <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b>
 adventure intended for four 4th-level characters. The encounters play 
out on the battle maps included in this product. To run these encounters
 properly, you (as the Dungeon Master) need the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, and <i>Monster Manual</i>, as well as some <b>D&amp;D</b>
 miniatures. The Adventure Background (see below) contains all of the 
information you need to get the adventure underway. Although designed 
for 4th-level characters, this adventure requires only minor adjustments
 to adapt it to lower- or higher-level play.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using the Battle Maps</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Fantastic Locations: Fane of the Drow </i>includes 
four miniatures scale maps that provide exciting battlegrounds for RPG 
encounters or miniatures skirmishes. These maps allow for dynamic and 
challenging encounters, encouraging you and your players to make 
important tactical decisions while combat is underway.</p>
<p align="left"><b>For the Roleplaying Game:</b><i>Fantastic Locations </i>battle
 maps don't depict your average dungeon complex. The maps aren't meant 
to represent an entire adventure, either. Instead, the maps provide 
interesting locations for key scenes and important battles. The monster 
tactics take advantage of the maps provided, ensuring that the battles 
range over large sections of the map terrain.</p>
<p align="left">Small reproductions of the maps, with the numbered 
locations within each site identified, are printed on the inside covers 
of this booklet. For obvious reasons, your players should not be allowed
 to view these small maps.</p>
<p align="left">If you decide not to run the <i>Fane of the Drow </i>adventure, you can freely adapt the battle maps to other encounters in your own campaign.</p>
<p align="left">Some of the labels on the battle maps are intended for the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 Miniatures Game only. These include areas marked "Start Area," "Exit," 
and "Victory Area." Room tags for the RPG adventure have been 
deliberately left off of the battle maps, although they appear on the 
DM's maps on the inside cover.</p>
<p align="left">Battle map labels that apply to the roleplaying game include the following:</p>
<p align="left"><i>Difficult Terrain: </i>Squares marked with a 
light-colored triangle are considered difficult terrain. Each square of 
difficult terrain costs 2 squares to move into (3 squares if it's a 
diagonal move).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Risky Terrain: </i>Squares marked with a 
light-colored skull are considered risky terrain. Any creature that 
enters a square of risky terrain has a 25% chance of taking 2d6 points 
of damage.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Sacred Circles: </i>Any creature that stands on a 
sacred circle (wholly or partly) gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls. In 
addition, that creature's attacks are considered magic for the purpose 
of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2005%20-%2009-14%20-%20Fane%20of%20the%20Drow%20and%20Sons%20of%20Gruumsh%20Excerpts_files/dx20050901a_FaneLolth.jpg" border="1" height="282" width="400"></p>
<p align="left"><b>For Skirmish Play:</b> The maps in this product are carefully designed for fast and exciting <b>D&amp;D</b> miniatures play. You can use these maps for any <i>D&amp;D Miniatures </i>games. Starting in 2006, you will be able to use <i>Fantastic Locations </i>maps in sanctioned miniatures tournaments.</p>
<p align="left">Refer to page 16 for specifics on using these maps with official <b>D&amp;D</b> miniatures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adventure Background</b></p>
<p align="left">For the past few months, a small and relatively isolated
 dwarven fortress called Stonehelm has suffered from drow raids. 
Although the dark elves seem too few in number to approach the fortress 
itself, they have slain several dwarf miners brave or foolish enough to 
venture beyond its protective confines. Hoping to rid themselves of the 
drow threat and gain access to the valuable mithral mines near the drow 
enclave of Til'Asperna, the dwarves enlist the aid of adventurers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Choosing an Adventure Hook</b></p>
<p align="left">The player characters can become involved in the 
dwarves' plight in one of several ways. Choose the hook that best suits 
your particular group of characters:</p>
<p align="left">-- Dwarves occupying a small fortress called Stonehelm 
hire the PCs. Their farthest-ranging miners have recently encountered 
drow and goblin raiders, and the dwarves need help from adventurers to 
drive the drow and their goblin slaves away.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If You Choose This Hook: </i>The adventure assumes 
that you use this option, and you need to make only minor modifications 
to adapt the adventure to your own campaign world.</p>
<p align="left">-- The PCs are traveling through the fringes of the 
Underdark on their way to some important destination when they stumble 
upon the drow enclave of Til'Asperna.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If You Choose This Hook: </i>The adventure begins at 
Til'Asperna instead of the dwarven fortress of Stonehelm. The PCs can 
visit the adventure's four encounter areas (Mithral Mines, Drow Enclave,
 Fane of Lolth, and Tomb of Queen Peregrine) in any order.</p>
<p align="left">-- One of the PCs' friends or acquaintances disappears 
after venturing into a cave that leads to Til'Asperna. PCs who explore 
the cave (Search DC 20) discover a secret door at the back of the cave 
leading to a secret tunnel. The tunnel descends for over a mile before 
finally connecting with the Mithral Mines.</p>
<p align="left"><i>If You Choose This Hook: </i>The friend was captured 
by a goblin raiding party and taken as a slave to Til'Asperna. 
Characters can learn this information by listening for rumors around the
 dwarven fortress of Stonehelm (Gather Information DC 15). Now he is one
 of the prisoners in the dungeon waiting his turn in the torture 
chamber.</p>
<p align="left"><b>1: Mithral Mines</b></p>
<p align="left">The first section of this adventure takes place in an 
extensive area of mines and natural caverns that marks the border 
between the lower reaches of the dwarven fortress of Stonehelm and the 
drow enclave known as Til'Asperna. Til'Asperna and the mines in its 
immediate vicinity lie on the fringe of the Underdark, and the enclave 
and surrounding area have long been the sites of confrontation between 
the dwarves of Stonehelm, duergar forces from deep within the earth, and
 drow seeking to hold on to their outpost.</p>
<p align="left">The drow of Til'Asperna and their duergar neighbors 
alternate between uneasy truces and outright conflict. Currently, the 
two groups are in prolonged negotiations about this area rich in 
mithral. Both sides are quite interested in taking possession of it, but
 both are using it as a bargaining chip. According to the terms of the 
latest temporary treaty, neither side is permitted to explore or exploit
 this area. The small group of drow that controls the enclave managed to
 drive the duergar out of the area several weeks ago and force a 
short-term truce that holds still.</p>
<p align="left">Sensing a lull in the conflict between the two evil 
races, the dwarves of Stonehelm must strike quickly. The dwarves sense 
that they must prevent both the drow and the duergar from gathering 
enough might to thoroughly dominate the region or forge a lasting 
treaty. More importantly, the dwarves must keep their own fortress 
secure and therefore cannot devote their own military might to the area.
 With little recourse, the dwarves enlist some adventurers to finally 
secure the valuable mines and to drive the drow from Til'Asperna.</p>
<p align="left">The mithral mines show evidence of the drow occupation, 
from discarded weapons to the ancient magical symbols of the ruined 
teleportation circle (see below).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Journey to the Mines</b></p>
<p align="left">Once the adventurers have agreed to drive the drow from 
Til'Asperna and the nearby Mithral Mines, the first step in their 
journey takes them through the fortress of Stonehelm itself and then 
deep into the earth through a series of caverns and mine shafts.</p>
<p align="left">Read or paraphrase the following text to the players:</p>
<p align="left"><i>The journey through the mines near the dwarven 
fortress of Stonehelm is uneventful at first. The even tunnels of the 
dwarves are easy to navigate, safely reinforced, and well guarded. Dwarf
 sentries, stationed at key defensive points, eye you warily as you 
pass, but they don't hesitate to point you toward the areas plagued by 
drow raiders once you identify your purpose in their mines.</i></p>
<p align="left">If you'd like to extend the adventure, you can insert an
 encounter with one or more wandering Underdark predators of the 
appropriate Challenge Rating (CR). Some possibilities include a group of
 1d6+6 kobold miners, a pair of dire bats, a dark creeper, or a 
burrowing ankheg.</p>
