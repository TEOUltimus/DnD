<p align="LEFT">About a week ago, a group of adventurers came to 
Undermountain to engage in some exploration and treasure hunting. 
Unfortunately for them, they encountered a vampire beyond their ability 
to combat. Now they are vampire spawn under his control.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This room is where they made their last stand and where 
they died. Not too far away lies a room in which their new master made 
them construct coffins. The vampire who now controls them keeps his 
coffin elsewhere, and he plans to have his spawn help him move it up to a
 safe location in Waterdeep.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Read the text below as the PCs open the door to the room:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">You open the door to the room and a clatter indicates 
that something behind it tumbled to the floor. A helmet rolls around 
into view even as the stench of death wafts your way. Two bodies lie in 
the chamber amid stains of drying blood that spatter the floor. One is 
tightly wrapped in a blanket that has been tied about its form. A large 
brown stain around its head hints at some terrible injury beneath the 
cloth. The other body is headless and nearly naked. It seems as though 
something tore the head from its neck and then ripped at its garments 
and body. Long scratch marks furrow its flesh and its clothing and chain
 armor lie about it in tatters. Both appear to be male humans. As you 
take in the scene, a narrow black beetle crawls out of the neck of the 
headless corpse and scuttles away across the bloodstained floor.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Items also lie strewn about the room. Weapons of various
 sorts, armor, backpacks, bedrolls, and other adventuring gear make up 
most of the gear, but even a quick glance shows far too many items for 
these two to have carried. Of particular note is a scroll tube in the 
center of the room. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs enter the room, the vampires are in the 
next chamber. The vampire spawn take gaseous form when they hear the 
clatter of the helmet rolling away from the door. The vampire aristocrat
 takes the form of a bat and clings to the ceiling while he uses his 
children of the night ability to summon 1d4+1 bat swarms.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All the vampires then remain silent and still until a PC
 enters their room or the bat swarms arrive to harry the PCs. At that 
point, all four vampire spawn end their gaseousness and attack. 
Meanwhile the vampire aristocrat flutters about the room to observe the 
PCs for the first 2 rounds of combat. He seeks the PC who poses the 
greatest threat to his spawn and thus himself. When he decides who that 
is, he takes his normal form and focuses his attacks on that person.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs open up the scroll tube, it glows with the 
brightness of a torch. The scroll inside is the diary of one of the 
adventurers who is now a vampire spawn. The glowing aspect of the scroll
 comes from a <i>continual flame</i> spell cast on the paper so the author would always have light to read and write.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are the contents of the diary:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/UM_level1/UMRUM14ph.zip">Download a PDF of this player's handout.</a> (21k ZIP/PDF)</b></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">When a PC enters the room in which the vampires wait, describe the room this way if the vampires are still in it:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">This long room bears none of the carnage of the previous
 room. Instead four long makeshift crates lie against the far wall. They
 were built with detritus from the dungeon: pieces of doors, broken 
shields, and bits of cast-off armor. Nails and rope hold them in 
coffinlike shapes. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Read the following only if one of the PCs looks up.</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">Several forms hover near the ceiling. Translucent 
humanoids float close to the roof, their bodies like fog. Suddenly they 
materialize and hiss at you, clinging to the ceiling like spiders! </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If a PC enters the room after the vampires leave it, use the same description but leave out the last paragraph above.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The four boxes described above are makeshift coffins for
 the vampire spawn. When a spawn is killed, its gaseous form travels to 
this chamber and the coffin the vampire aristocrat demanded it build for
 itself. The vampire aristocrat keeps his coffin far away in another 
part of Undermountain. When he is killed, his gaseous form passes out of
 the rooms and travels away through the halls.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vampire Spawn (4):</b> Use the statistics for the Vampire Spawn (59/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966280000">Deathknell</a></i> miniatures set. If you don't have that miniature, use the statistics from the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vampire Aristocrat (1):</b> Use the statistics for the Vampire Aristocrat (57/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966250000">Archfiends</a></i> miniatures set. If you don't have that miniature, use the statistics for the sample vampire from the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The vampire aristocrat has the 
equipment listed on its miniatures card or on its Monster Manual entry, 
depending on which you decide to use. The vampire spawn have no 
equipment, having divested themselves of it after death. This equipment 
lies scattered about the room where they were killed, and in some cases 
they used it to build a coffin. It consists mainly of bedrolls, 
backpacks, rotting rations, a few mundane weapons, a couple suits of 
chainmail, and some personal items. In total it's worth about 550 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b></p>
<ul>
<li> If you like, you could have the vampire aristocrat summon other 
creatures with his children of the night ability. Also, the vampire 
aristocrat could take other forms with his alternate form ability. The 
Wolf (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965800000">Harbinger</a></i>, 37/80), Dire Wolf (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/967010000">Giants of Legend</a></i>, 25/72), Timber Wolf (<i>Deathknell,</i> 27/60), and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mi/20050915a">Dire Bat</a> (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/967380000">Underdark</a></i>, 44/60) can be useful in such situations.<br><br></li>
<li> Give the vampire aristocrat a name and background to suit your campaign. Perhaps he is a noble of Waterdeep. <br><br></li>
<li> If killed, the vampire aristocrat might lead the PCs on a merry 
chase through the dungeon as he seeks out his coffin. He could 
intentionally lead them through traps and monster-infested areas that 
pose no threat to him. <br><br></li>
<li> If the PCs are all dominated, that doesn't mean it's the end of the
 adventure. Once the vampire and his spawn feed for a bit, he stops the 
blood drain before the PCs die. He wants the PCs alive and dominated so 
that he can use them as pawns in his plans. Perhaps he has them seek 
something in Undermountain, following them through the dungeon. Maybe he
 has them go to the surface to serve his aims there. <br><br></li>
<li> The diary could reveal something interesting to the PCs, such as a 
map of part of the dungeon or the danger of a particular room.</li>

</p><p align="LEFT"><b>About the Author </b></p> Once Editor-in-Chief of <i>Dragon </i>magazine and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain.<p></p>
