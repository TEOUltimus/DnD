<p align="left"><i>At last, the true enemy of Loudwater was revealed to 
be the fallen first Green Regent. The corrupted champion of Mielikki 
sought to return to the Delimbiyr Vale. The key to his victory and 
defeat were the Heart and Mind of Karsus.</i></p>
<p align="left">Teseryne Truesilver<br> Daughter of Talanthe Truesilver<br> Year of Rogue Dragons</p>
<p align="left">The Order of the Jade Blade passed the rest of the 
winter in Waterdeep. While they waited for the thaws, Otar, the orcish 
Green Regent, explained to them the true nature of the threat that faced
 Loudwater. Centuries ago Mielikki chose a dragon by the name of 
Guev'Ressunvee to be the first Green Regent of the Delimbiyr Vale. 
Guev'Ressunvee twisted the powers given to him, becoming a cruel and 
arrogant tyrant. The Forest Lady stripped him of his mantle and cast him
 out of the world. Guev'Ressunvee plotted his return for centuries and 
found a way through the ruins of Karse. Karse was a floating city of 
Netheril that had fallen from the sky into the southern High Forest when
 that ancient empire collapsed. The Green King was using the strange, 
arcane energies of the ruins of Karse to destroy the bindings that kept 
him out of Faerûn.</p>
<p align="left">Otar said that Mielikki had come to him while he was 
comatose and explained how to foil Guev'Ressunvee. For the Green King to
 break his exile, the <i>Coalescence of Scorn</i> needed to be absorbed by the Heart of Karsus. However, if the <i>Coalescence of Scorn</i>
 were to be absorbed by the Mind of Karsus instead, the fragmented 
consciousness of Karsus, the archmage who caused the fall of Netheril, 
would realize the gravity of his sin and find a lasting peace. This 
would close the path that Guev'Ressunvee planned on using to enter the 
Realms.</p>
<p align="left">In the spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, the Jade 
Blade returned to Loudwater and the Delimbiyr Vale. Otar believed that 
the Green King would be watching him in particular. So he gave the <i>Coalescence of Scorn</i>
 to the Jade Blade and asked them to enter the Mind of Karse. Otar would
 enter the Heart of Karse to block the Guev'Ressunvee from using his 
foothold there.</p>
<p align="left">Parting ways with Otar, the Jade Blade journeyed to a 
part of the southern High Forest called the Dire Woods. At the heart of 
this eldritch woodland was a butte that rose hundreds of feet into the 
air. After several hours of searching, the adventurers found a game 
trail that wound up to a strange rock formation on the butte face. At 
the base of the trail were three large, green crystals jutting out of 
the forest floor. Our heroes recognized them as the Eyes of Guev. They 
had seen the same crystals in Undermountain and knew that they allow the
 Green King to see the area around them and summon allies there, which 
Guev'Ressunvee promptly did.</p>
<p align="left">A bone devil stepped out of each of the crystals and 
immediately began to summon more of their kind. The Jade Blade realized 
that the gems held the devils here. They shattered the crystals, which 
pulled the devils back to whatever hell they came from.</p>
<p align="left">The adventurers climbed the path, which ended before a 
twenty-foot tall carving of an ugly face with its eyes and mouth closed 
and twisted in pain. When the Jade Blade approached, a rumbling voice 
demanded answers to a series of questions regarding the fate of Karsus. 
The adventurers knew that his most hated foe was Mystryl and that he 
loved power more than his own people, which answered two of the 
questions. They were then asked to name Karsus' final words, which 
happened to be contained within the <i>Coalescence of Scorn.</i> They placed the orb in the face's mouth and the carving slid aside, revealing a tunnel into the darkness.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade retrieved the Coalescence from the carved
 face and entered the butte. Shortly afterward, they met a huge, 
disembodied eye that flew through the air. This was the Neversleeping 
Eye and was all that remained of Andoris Deranthar, an arcanist who 
administered justice and would hunt for spies in Karse. The 
Neversleeping Eye demanded that the adventurers identify what was the 
greatest thing one could serve. Our heroes deduced that the answer the 
Eye was looking for was truth. The Eye then demanded to know the 
adventurers' mission. When they answered truthfully, it allowed them to 
pass.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade continued to explore the Mind of Karsus 
and encountered an apparition that told them that they were fools for 
intruding and that they would now have time to consider their folly 
alone. The adventurers were each teleported to separate rooms where they
 fought a variety of monsters. During the combat, they were continually 
teleported from room to room so that they each fought the different 
monsters. Once all the monsters were slain, they returned to the main 
chamber and were able to move on.</p>
<p align="left">Shortly afterward, the adventurers were ambushed by 
mindflayers serving Guev'Ressunvee. They slew the aberrations and 
entered a maze made of walls of force. Mist filled the rooms and 
provided perfect cover for the destrachans, who are sightless and 
tracked the adventurers with their uncanny hearing.</p>
<p align="left">After defeating the destrachans and finding their way 
through the maze, the Jade Blade came upon a large cavern. Zacharia, who
 was once the chief constable of Karse but was now a helmed horror, sat 
on a throne in the center of the cavern. She questioned the Jade Blade 
as to why she should grant them an audience with the greatest of all 
wizards. Our heroes showed her the <i>Coalescence of Scorn,</i> and she 
agreed to let them pass. Zacharia warned them that the Mind of Karsus 
was but a fragment of the last moments of the Karse enclave and was 
haunted by a beholder. Zacharia would not permit the coalescence to 
enter until the eye tyrant was killed.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade passed through the arch and found 
themselves in a ghostly recreation of Karse. The city suddenly shook 
violently and started to fall. Wading through the panicking spectral 
citizens, the adventurers found the beholder and killed it. Zacharia 
appeared and showed them where to find the spectral Karsus. When they 
touched the <i>Coalescence of Scorn</i> to the specter, a look of shock 
and understanding filled his face, and the orb, Karsus, and the city 
disappeared. Karsus' mind was finally at rest, closing this portal to 
the Green King.</p>
