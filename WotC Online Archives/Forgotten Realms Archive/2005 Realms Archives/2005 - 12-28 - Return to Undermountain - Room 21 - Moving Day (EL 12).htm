<p align="left"> This encounter works best if the PCs' average level is 
one to three levels lower than the EL. The encounter with the roper will
 be much more challenging and interesting if the PCs must struggle to 
defeat it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This scenario assumes the PCs enter the area from the 
eastern side of the room rather than coming from the direction of the 
large caves in the southeastern section of the dungeon (check out the 
next few articles to learn more about that area). If they do not, modify
 the encounter to suit your needs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As the PCs enter the area depicted on the map, you can 
give them a chance to hear the screaming of the kobolds as they run 
through the dungeon. If they do, they have a round to prepare for what 
is coming. If they don't hear the kobolds, you can start the encounter 
right away. If they block the eastern door before the kobolds enter, the
 combat works a little differently. See the Blocking the Eastern Door 
section for a description of how this changes the encounter.</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> This wide and long rectangular chamber has three doors:
 the one you entered through, one on the opposite wall, and one on the 
wall that spans the distance between the two long walls. A hall off the 
far end of the room forms the final exit.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Suddenly, the farthest door bursts open and screaming kobolds run into the room!</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs likely think of kobolds as laughable threats, 
and they're right. In this encounter, the kobolds serve as a distraction
 that obscures the real threat: a roper.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Place twelve kobolds in the room, tracing a single-move 
running path for each of them from their starting positions shown on the
 map. Have the players roll for initiative, roll for the kobolds, and 
secretly roll for the roper. The kobolds try to avoid the PCs if they 
can, but they fight their way through if the PCs threaten areas they 
must run through to escape through the western door.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When it is the roper's turn, read or paraphrase the following:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> Another kobold runs into the room with a terrified 
wail. You note that it is slower than the others due to a pronounced 
limp as it scurries toward you. Just as you register that fact, a 
glistening gray rope whips out of the darkness of the far doorway and 
wraps about the kobold's neck! The reptilian creature instantly goes 
limp and is dragged back through the door, its bulging eyes wide with 
terror. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The roper has arrived and stands in the next room at the
 location marked "R" on the map. From the next room it attacks the PCs, 
using its enormous reach to its advantage. If a PC moves up to fight it,
 or if it drags a PC into the room, it shuts the door between itself and
 the other PCs with one of its strand attacks. It can do this because 
the dragging ability of its strands allows it to pull the door shut. If 
it wants to push a door open or closed, it must use a standard action 
like anyone else.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The roper is looking for a meal, and the kobolds make 
easy pickings. When the kobold it grabbed reaches it 2 rounds later, it 
bites the reptilian in half. If the PCs feel like saving the kobold, 
they need to work fast.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Note that spellcasters will likely have little or no 
chance of beating the roper's spell resistance. Allow a PC with 
Knowledge (arcana) ranks to make a check and learn that fact. That means
 that spellcasters must rely on spells that do not allow spell 
resistance -- typically spells cast on allies and conjuration effects.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kobolds (13):</b> Use the statistics on page 161 of the <i>Monster Manual</i> for kobolds. There have been many great kobold miniatures you can use, but the Kobold Miner (38/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/967380000">Underdark</a></i> miniatures set <i></i>is particularly appropriate.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You might also consider using Kobold Warrior (48/80) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965800000">Harbinger</a></i> miniatures set, Kobold Skirmisher (35/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965830000">Dragoneye</a></i> miniatures set, Kobold Champion (37/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966240000">Aberrations</a></i> miniatures set, Kobold Sorcerer (38/60) from the <i>Aberrations</i> miniatures set, Kobold Soldier (44/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966990000">Angelfire</a></i> miniatures set. If you like, you can use the statistics on their cards instead of those from the <i>Monster Manual</i>.
 It won't increase the difficulty of the encounter appreciably, but it 
will make the kobolds a more interesting element of the encounter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The kobolds once lived in the western part of the large 
cavern of this level of Undermountain. A change in the eastern end of 
the cavern caused many cave inhabitants to shift their habitats 
westward, and the kobolds fled their home to seek a new place to live in
 Undermountain. They had been camping in the room just outside the 
cavern and were feeling fairly safe until the roper broke in and chased 
them out.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If spoken to, the kobolds relate the reason for their 
fear ("A kobold-eating rock with arms as long as dragons!") and plead to
 be allowed to pass. If kobolds are alive and in the area once the roper
 is dead, they explain their plight in exchange for their lives and 
freedom. The kobolds won't go back to the cavern willingly or travel 
with the PCs, preferring to go it on their own in Undermountain rather 
than trust the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Roper (1):</b> Use the statistics for the Roper (56/60) from the <i>Underdark </i>miniatures set. If you don't have that miniature, use the statistics from the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The roper lived in the large cavern but it found its 
home too crowded by other creatures. As a result, it was seeking a new 
hunting range when it happened upon the kobold tribe. The kobolds make 
quick meals, so it's pleased to slaughter as many of them as it can 
snatch up with its tentacles.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs somehow parlay with the roper, it can explain
 how a larger-than-normal amount of activity in the cavern's eastern 
side convinced it to find a new hunting ground. It can describe "robed 
ones like you" moving about and claiming territory in the cavern, but it
 doesn't know specifics; even the color of their robes is a mystery as 
it saw them with darkvision.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The roper's body contains a few small 
gemstones: a ruby worth 100 gp, a ruby worth 200 gp, four rubies worth 
25 gp, a diamond worth 500 gp, and two emeralds worth 50 gp. It also 
contains a <i>gem of brightness </i>with 35 charges.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blocking the Eastern Door</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If the players react to the noise of the kobolds by 
holding shut the eastern door, the kobolds bang against the door a few 
times but are then chased north. They outpace the roper and get to the 
northern door of the room in about 5 rounds. The roper might follow 
them, taking 11 rounds to reach the northern door. If the roper can hear
 the players on the other side of the door, it instead attempts to push 
the door open while the kobolds run around. This results in an opposed 
Strength check with a PC if a PC is holding the door shut. If it can't 
get the door open in 3 rounds, it follows the kobolds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Check back for the next few articles to learn more about the cavern on level 1 and events connected to this encounter.</li>
<li> If the PCs charm a kobold or the roper, or if you allow them to 
convince one of the monsters to aid them, a monster of this encounter 
might work as a guide for the PCs. It might explain about the geography 
and inhabitants of the cavern and show the PCs how to avoid certain 
dangers.</li>
<li> Perhaps a kobold or the roper is working as a spy for another 
inhabitant of the cavern and offers to be the PCs' guide but instead 
leads them into a trap.</li>
<li> The kobolds lived in the cavern, but they might know something of 
the surrounding dungeon rooms. They could tell the PCs about other 
interesting locations nearby, or one might have a crude map scratched 
into a stirge skin.</li>
<li> If the PCs seek a particular person in Undermountain, the gems they
 find in the roper might be the remains of that person's jewelry. This 
might mean that person is dead, but maybe the person gave the jewelry to
 the roper's victim. Only the roper knows for sure.</li>
<li> You can increase the EL of the encounter by adding another roper or
 by using another race instead of the kobolds. Seven minotaurs could 
replace the kobolds, making this an EL 13 encounter.</li>

</p><p align="LEFT"><b>About the Author </b></p> Once Editor-in-Chief of <i>Dragon </i>magazine and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain.<p></p>
