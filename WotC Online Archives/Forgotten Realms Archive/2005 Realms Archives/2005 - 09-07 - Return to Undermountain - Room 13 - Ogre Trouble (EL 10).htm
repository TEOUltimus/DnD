<p align="LEFT">Note that although this is listed as an EL 10 encounter,
 it could be run as an EL 8 or 9 encounter and a second EL 8 encounter 
later due to the behavior of the ogre mage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An ogre mage named Tharrusk recently arrived in 
Undermountain via one of Halaster's gates. Tharrusk came from far to the
 east in the lands of Kara-Tur where he ruled over a small city-state of
 humans. Several of his slaves had vanished from his fortress, and, in 
searching for them, Tharrusk discovered the magical <i>portal</i> to 
Undermountain. Intrigued by the powerful magic and concerned that some 
unknown enemy was using it against him, Tharrusk himself investigated 
the halls he saw. Unfortunately for Tharrusk, the <i>portal</i> closed behind him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Having wandered the halls of Undermountain for two 
months, Tharrusk no longer believes himself the victim of some enemy's 
plot. He has seen too many strange creatures and odd manifestations of 
magic to think that someone with a grudge singled him out. Instead, 
Tharrusk thinks his appearance in this strange dungeon is a magical 
accident of some sort due to the dungeon's strange properties. Tharrusk 
hopes to find another gate through which to escape, or discover some 
creature that knows the secret to leaving what seems to him to be an 
infinite dungeon in some netherworld.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A few weeks ago, the ogre mage met a tribe of ogres and 
coerced them into taking him as leader. He was disappointed to discover 
they knew little more about the dungeon than he did, but he has settled 
for leading them until he can find a way to escape. Tharrusk has had the
 ogres collect fine things from about the dungeon so that he can live in
 some semblance of the comfort he is accustomed to, but the ogres' 
efforts to bring him tribute have netted little more than shattered 
furniture and ruined tapestries.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs enter the chamber, the ogre mage has just 
been disappointed by his minions' latest recovery (a crate of moldering 
cheese) and is sulking invisibly while he allows the ogres to argue over
 who gets to eat their "treasure."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Read the text below as the PCs approach an entrance to the room:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> Suddenly you hear several deep, growling voices 
shouting from somewhere ahead! Some of the noises they make sound like 
words, but much of it is just roaring and growling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Allow the PCs to make Listen <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_check')">checks</a>. If no succeeding PC speaks Giant, read the following:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> You can understand what's being said, but it sounds 
like an argument of some sort with several participants. Suddenly the 
roaring rises to a crescendo, something cracks wetly, and then you hear 
something scrabbling about. After that the speakers seem to move apart 
and grow quieter. Now all you can hear is lower growling sounds and what
 might be some noisy eating.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If a PC who speaks Giant succeeds at the Listen check, read the following text to that PC's player:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> You hear deep voices speaking in Giant between roars 
and growls. It's difficult to tell, but you'd guess that at least half a
 dozen beings are speaking. They seem to be arguing over some tribute to
 someone they call "King Tharrusk."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Suddenly one voice howls louder than the rest, "I end this! Tribute is mine! King no want. I have!" </p>
<p align="LEFT">You hear other voices shout in unison "No!" and "Mine!" 
along with growls. Suddenly a wet cracking noise sounds out and 
scrabbling noises follow it. The voices seem to grow further apart and 
quieter as you hear the sounds of what might be some noisy eating.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs enter the room, read the following:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> You see a large square chamber filled with ogres! 
They're standing apart from one another, each greedily stuffing 
something grayish in its mouth or licking the stuff off shattered wood. 
In the center of the chamber, near a haphazard collection of rubbish and
 ruined furniture, one ogre even laps crumbs of the gray paste off of 
the floor. The smell in the room is a pungent reek of sweat, offal, and a
 ranker smell of spoiled food.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A fight is likely inevitable, but if the PCs find a way 
to observe without being seen by the ogres, the ogres eventually finish 
eating. If this happens, a disembodied voice (Tharrusk, still invisible)
 speaks in Giant, ordering the ogres to go find better tribute. The 
ogres then pick up their things and head the PCs' way . . .</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a fight starts, the ogres simply move in to attack.
 If the PCs move into the tunnels to lessen the power of the ogre's 
numbers, some of the ogres attempt to overrun the PCs and get behind 
them while others fetch crude javelins from the room to hurl from behind
 their compatriots.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>"King" Tharrusk (1):</b> Use the statistics for the Ogre Mage (46/60) from the<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966990000"><i>Angelfire</i></a><i></i>miniature set. If you don't have that miniature, use the statistics for the Ogre Mage from the <i>Monster Manual</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ogres (7):</b> Use the statistics for the Ogre (71/80) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965800000">Harbinger</a></i> miniatures set. If you don't have that miniature, use the statistics from the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Tharrusk doesn't enter melee on behalf of the ogres. 
He's more interested in what the PCs know. As soon as he sees that the 
PCs are humanoids that seem smarter than his ogres, he hollers to his 
minions in Giant that they should strike to subdue. </p>
<p align="LEFT">At this point, any ogre not down to half its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a> complies and starts trying to grapple or strike for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonlethaldamage')">nonlethal damage</a>. Yet if any ogre suffers enough <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a> to reduce it to half its hit points or less, it abandons Tharrusk's commands and starts trying to kill the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Tharrusk is far more interested in learning what the PCs
 know about the dungeon (and if they might know a way out) than 
remaining loyal to his ogres. When four of the ogres die or start 
striking for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lethaldamage')">lethal damage</a>,
 Tharrusk (still invisible) polymorphs into a humanoid form that he 
thinks would be most welcomed by the PCs (an elf if several elves are in
 the party or a human if there are more humans). Then Tharrusk enters 
the fray on the side of the PCs, striking the ogres with a <i>cone of cold</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Tharrusk hopes to befriend the PCs by claiming he is a spellcaster from a far-away land transported to the dungeon by a magic <i>portal.</i>
 Tharrusk speaks in Common and sticks close to the truth in the hopes 
that his predicament will be familiar to the PCs. He asks many questions
 about where he is and the nature of the dungeons. If he hears about the
 city above, it piques his interest and he asks even more questions. If 
questioned in return, he eagerly and truthfully relates his story about 
his homeland to the PCs and explains everything in great detail except 
that he is an ogre mage. He hopes that the PCs will recognize something 
and tell him how far away from home the <i>portal</i> brought him. Of 
course, when Tharrusk relates how he was trying to recover his escaped 
slaves when he entered the dungeons, the PCs might begin to suspect that
 there's more to Tharrusk than meets the eye.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If allowed to do so, Tharrusk travels through 
Undermountain with the PCs and uses his "spells" to help them. 
Eventually though, Tharrusk will feel he has learned all he can from 
them and take some opportunity to attack them and take their magic 
items.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The ogres wear hide armor and wield 
greatclubs. Tharrusk wears a chain shirt and carries a greatsword. 
Beyond these meager possessions, the only item of value in the room is a
 tattered tapestry that depicts Ulbaerag Bloodhand, a Tethyrian warlord 
who conquered the feuding tribes around Blackcloak Hold, Halaster's 
above-ground citadel. Though worth 1,000 gp in Waterdeep, its value is 
impossible for a PC to correctly determine using the Appraise skill 
unless a PC can succeed at a DC 25 Knowledge (history) check, as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't have seven Ogre miniatures, use other ogres like the Ogre Ravager (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965830000">56/60 </a><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965830000">Dragoneye</a>) and Skullcrusher Ogre (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966280000">41/60 </a><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966280000">Deathknell</a>) to represent the ogres, but use the statistics from the <i>Monster Manual</i> for a normal ogre. <br><br></li>
<li> If led to the surface, Tharrusk might reveal his nature to the PCs 
and then flee into the city. The PCs then have to deal with what they've
 unleashed. <br><br></li>
<li> The gate that Tharrusk came through might open again, allowing PCs to venture to distant Kara-Tur. <br><br></li>
<li> The ogres spent a good deal of time collecting objects from around 
the dungeon. Perhaps one of their tributes to Tharrusk was an item the 
PCs are looking for, such as a key to a magic <i>portal.</i><br><br></li>
<li> The PCs might encounter one of Tharrusk's escaped slaves before or 
after this encounter. If Tharrusk is with them at the time, the 
encounter could cause Tharrusk to reveal his true nature.</li>

</p><p align="LEFT"><b>About the Author </b></p> Once Editor-in-Chief of <i>Dragon </i>magazine and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain.<p></p>
