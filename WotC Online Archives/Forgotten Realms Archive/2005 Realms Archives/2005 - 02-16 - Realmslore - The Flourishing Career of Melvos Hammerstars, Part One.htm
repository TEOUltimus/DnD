<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Upcountry Sembia</b></p>
<p align="left">Melvos Hammerstars is a typical Sembian merchant of the 
sort known in the realm as successful. He owns a tallhouse in a 
fashionable <i>darth</i> (neighborhood) of Saerloon, a <i>down</i> (rich
 compound) in the countryside, and several rental properties. His array 
of businesses, investments, and trade deals astonishes most 
non-Sembians, but it is entirely typical of many moderately successful 
folk in his country -- so a look at Melvos is a useful illustration of 
what folk are like in the prosperous realm known to many in the Realms 
as "the Land of Rich Fat Merchants."</p>
<p align="left">First, let's learn more about the landscape of <i>upcountry</i>
 (rural) Sembia. Most country-dwelling Sembians live in small roadside 
compounds consisting of a wall enclosing a dwelling, an outhouse, 
stables and sometimes a paddock, a coach-shed (which often serves to 
keep the worst wet weather off an extensive woodpile), a garden, and 
sometimes a guesthouse.</p>
<p align="left">These compounds vary from tiny, poorly built <i>steads</i>
 (with dirt-floor cottages and yards crowded with salvage from 
elsewhere, firewood, tripods for growing beans, snares to catch rabbits,
 and drying frames for furs and scraped hides) to palatial <i>downs</i> 
that enclose mansions and have large for-crop-sales vegetable gardens 
(complete with servants' huts, extensive root-cellars, and perhaps a 
barn) and <i>bowers</i> (pleasure gardens) dominated by tended trees, floral beds, little pools, statuary, benches, small (gazebo) pavilions known as <i>evenspires</i>, and turf paths known as <i>greenwalks</i>.</p>
<p align="left">Strings and clusters of such walled dwellings line most 
Sembian roads, with farms lying behind and between them. They are 
occasionally separated by back lanes leading to woodlots studded with 
small <i>arndels</i> (cabins), the preferred abodes of half-elves and 
all others desiring rustic privacy, or to the walled and gated country 
estates of the very wealthy (which are often referred to as <i>hunts</i>
 because of what most often happens therein, but always have individual,
 grandiose names, such as Blackeagles, Dragontowers, or Greatturrets).</p>
<p align="left">Along major roads, inns with paddocks stand about a 
day's travel apart. Where nature also provides enough water to serve a 
horsepond or run a mill, a <i>wayhamlet</i> usually develops. Sembia holds scores of such; they're rarely more than a cluster of cottages with perhaps a smithy, <i>allgoods</i> shop (general store), and tavern.</p>
<p align="left">Rolling hills and many trees meet the eye everywhere in 
upcountry Sembia; the only changes wrought by extensive human settlement
 are the disappearance of really tall timber (felled for mast spars and 
roofbeams) and the appearance of far more open space (the "many small 
linked fields" of the typical Sembian farm) than in the days when most 
local "open land" was the result of lightning- or 
red-dragon-breath-caused fires.</p>
<p align="left">Wolves, bears, and owlbears are becoming scarce in the 
increasingly populated Sembian countryside, but foxes, packs of wild 
dogs, and the more cunning prowling monsters are all too energetic. The 
still-extensive forests provide concealment and cross-country travel 
routes -- and the settlement provides predators with such ready food as 
chickens, goats, sheep, and young horses and cattle.</p>
<p align="left">Upcountry Sembia is a well-watered country, with many 
small streams and natural ponds. Large marshes are rare, but small bogs 
and thickets (known locally as <i>tangles</i>) are not. Signposts are few and poor, except on major roads; wandering dirt cart-lanes are the norm.</p>
<p align="left">Streams and their valleys are often the only ready ways 
through farm boundaries. Stiles are few, and farm fences tend to be 
nigh-impenetrable hedgerows of gathered, heaped stones and stumps, over 
which thornbushes and vines are encouraged to grow, and bird-deposited 
seeds are left undisturbed to sprout into thick tangles of greenery and 
interwoven vines.</p>
<p align="left">The walls of downs and country estates are usually just 
taller versions of field-barrier hedgerows, usually made of earth and 
stone rubble heaped together to have a near-vertical outer face 
(intended to be too steep to climb) but a more comfortable inner slope 
(up which successive barrows of earth and stone have been pushed and 
then dumped). Raspberry canes and thorny wild shrubs are typically 
planted on the upper slopes and tops of such walls to discourage 
passage.</p>
<p align="left">Only the walls of the hunts have dressed stone or smooth
 stucco outer facings (usually in a treacherously crumbling and 
falling-off state thanks to hard winter frosts), and only the largest 
such walls are broad enough to have guard paths along their tops. In the
 more dangerous days when walls were first being erected around 
upcountry Sembian landholdings, it was the fashion to liberally equip 
walltop paths with pit-full-of-sharp-spikes traps.</p>
