<p align="left"><b>Know Thy Watch</b></p>
<p align="left">Waterdeep has both a standing army (the City Guard) and a
 police force (the City Watch). Though they often work together, the 
average Waterdhavian or visitor to the city will most often come into 
contact with watch street patrols, and see the Guard only at city gates,
 manning the walls or boarding ships for harbor inspections, and 
overhead on griffonback.</p>
<p align="left">Down the years, watch patrols have exhibited a variety 
of ranks, uniforms, and strengths, because the watch experiments 
continually with tactics, equipment, and ways of achieving two 
impossibly conflicting aims: to <i>sometimes</i> catch miscreants by surprising them with persons they don't identify as watch officers; and to <i>usually</i>
 reassure citizens and enable them to cry for ready aid by allowing them
 to readily identify watch officers from afar, on sight, due to 
distinctive uniforms (and at night, distinctive lanterns and the like).</p>
<p align="left">Patrols pass along main streets once between bells, and 
vary their routes often. Dockside, "red-light," and known frequent-theft
 areas receive around five patrols per bell, as do known "bad" taverns 
and inns. Temples are policed lightly, because clergy are assumed to 
police their own grounds and buildings. (The term "hour" is unknown in 
the Realms, but temple bells strike more or less in unison, an hour 
apart.) Watch patrols are on foot but can call horsedrawn watch prison 
carts to carry off prisoners or confiscated goods.</p>
<p align="left">All watch patrols are armed and carry more than one 
"watch horn." These nonmagical signal horns are used to blow various -- 
and slightly altered, from time to time -- patterns of calls, to do one 
of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Summon watch reinforcements </li>
<li> Summon City Guard aid </li>
<li> Summon Watchful Order aid </li>
<li> Summon "duty healers" (priests lent by various city temples) </li>
<li> Proclaim that an alert or search is now ended</li>
<li> Proclaim that someone has been found </li>
<li> Warn fellow watch members away from a dangerous spot or delicate situation </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">To outsiders, "watchmen" (a term that some use for both 
genders, so a shopkeeper may be heard saying: "And then the lady 
watchman come running, sir, and strike me blind if she didn't . . .") 
come in three sorts: "patrolman" (male) or "patroljan" (female), 
"captain" (any officer controlling a patrol) and "commander" (any 
officer of higher rank). Many folk call every watch member "officer," 
just to be safe.</p>
<p align="left">Watch members actually hold these ranks, from lowest to 
highest: blade, sword or "armar" (equivalent to a sergeant), 
swordcaptain (patrol leader), rorden (in charge of a watchpost or 
barracks, or either five or six patrols), orsar (envoy to guilds, 
citizen groups, noble families; also serves as prisoner escorts and in 
honor guards), guardsword (duty head for shifts patrolling the city 
docks and gates), commander ("officer of the shift"), and watchlord (the
 administrative and disciplinary heads of the watch, usually three or 
four officers who hold special titles personally bestowed on them by 
Piergeiron). The Captain of the Watch holds sway over all of these.</p>
<p align="left">The watch also has special offices (such as jailer, armorer, and horsemaster) that are held in addition to ranks.</p>
<p align="left">"Civilar" is a term applied to all ranks from swordcaptains up through orsar.</p>
<p align="left">Swordcaptains and higher always wear uniforms or 
(rarely) armor with uniform tabards, and any watch member may wear 
helms, gauntlets, and leather armor if they (or a superior officer) 
deems it necessary. A watch member doesn't have the right to order an 
inferior watch member <i>not</i> to wear armor.</p>
<p align="left">Rank badges take the form of tabards; thanks to 
widespread counterfeiting, pins are no longer used except on ceremonial 
occasions. By rank, these badges are as follows (all are encircled by an
 oval line sculpted into a rolling wave at the bottom and the peak of 
Mount Waterdeep at the top):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blade:</b> diagonal slash (lower left to upper right) </li>
<li><b>Sword:</b> diagonal slash (upper left to lower right) </li>
<li><b>Swordcaptain:</b> X shape (crossed diagonal slashes) </li>
<li><b>Rorden:</b> horizontal dagger (hilt on left) </li>
<li><b>Orsar:</b> vertical open human right hand, fingers uppermost and palm showing </li>
<li><b>Guardsword:</b> two horizontal swords, upper one with hilt right, lower one with hilt left </li>
<li><b>All higher ranks:</b> two staring eyes, horizontal sword beneath them (hilt on left) </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Members of the watch enjoy a wide but legally undefined 
immunity from most Waterdhavian laws while exercising their duties. They
 can appeal any sentence uttered against them by any Black Robe 
(magistrate) to the Lords of Waterdeep, which in practice means 
Piergeiron -- who has been very lenient with watch members of long 
service and good character.</p>
<p align="left">On the other hand, watch members <i>hate</i> "bad" watch
 members and will hound a suspected bad apple until they flee the city, 
agree to all investigations, or clearly establish their innocence. Watch
 members found guilty of crimes or misbehavior are often fined by the 
watch as well as punished under law. Conversely, distinguished service 
often earns handsome retirement bonuses from the Lords (sometimes even 
outlying land or in-city buildings).</p>
<p align="left">Most Waterdhavians grumble at the watch, but obey them, 
because the watch is seen as fair (if often thick-headed) and helpful as
 well as jack-booted. (They'll unhesitatingly search for missing 
children, safeguard broken-open shops or scared persons, and so on.)</p>
<p align="left">Persons arrested by the watch are often taken to holding
 cells in the city wall towers, but the main lockup is a level of 
ironbar cells in the "dungeons" of Castle Waterdeep, with dangerous 
prisoners being handed over to the Guard for imprisonment in caverns 
inside Mount Waterdeep.</p>
