<p align="LEFT"><b>Intelligence DC 10: </b>The carvings of the mirror 
frame for the cloudy mirror hanging over the flat wall are identical to 
those on the frame that hangs in the niche near the east entrance. Allow
 a PC to make this check only if she has already seen the ghoulish frame
 near the east entrance.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Search DC 10: </b>If a PC searches the place behind 
the cloudy mirror where it seems there should be a niche, a check with 
this result allows the PC to know that<b></b>the section of wall behind 
the cloudy mirror isn't mortared to the wall and ceiling behind it, and 
it isn't stone. Also, the mirror seems attached to the wall. The mimic 
might attack a PC searching it, taking the opportunity to adhere the 
curious PC to itself. Note that dwarves and other creatures with 
stonecunning that come within 10 feet of the mimic gain a free Search 
check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spot DC 0: </b>The third niche from the east entrance
 on the north side contains an unbroken mirror, and where the fifth 
niche would be from the east entrance on the south side hangs a cloudy 
mirror on a section of wall flush with the hallway. Remember that each 
10 feet of distance imposes a-1 penalty on Spot checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spot DC 5: </b>The shards of glass on the ground are all broken pieces of silver-backed mirror.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spot DC 10:</b> Forty feet from the entrance, a dark 
brown stain lies on the gray stone floor, and some shards of glass in 
the area are similarly stained. A character who examines the stain by 
taste or closely smelling it immediately recognizes the stain as blood. 
If the PCs see the stain, and the players don't deduce this on their own
 or investigate it further, a DC 10 Intelligence check allows them to 
realize that it is probably dried blood.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spot DC 23: </b>If a PC succeeds at a Spot check to this degree, read the following text: </p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">The cloudy mirror with the carvings of ghoulish faces 
doesn't look right. The surface of the mirror appears rough rather than 
smooth, and a similar roughness appears on the wall behind it. As you 
watch, you think you see a slight movement in the wall and the mirror 
hanging on it. It's an almost imperceptibly slow pulse or sway. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Survival DC 10: </b>A successful DC 10 Survival check
 (characters do not need the Track feat) reveals that the bloodstain on 
the floor continues down the hall to the west beneath the shards of 
mirror.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Survival DC 15: </b>Someone with the Track feat who 
succeeds to this degree can deduce that the trail of blood appears to be

hanging in each niche appears to be unique. One is carved with daisy 
flowers, another with roses, and still another with the feathers of some
 bird. Two unbroken mirrors hang just ahead on your right and left. 
Mirrors like these two are clearly the source of the glass covering the 
floor. A clear mirror framed with wooden carvings of dolphins and fish 
hangs in a niche on the north side of the wall while a cloudy mirror 
with ghoulish faces hangs over a flat section of wall where it seems a 
niche would normally be.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Anyone reflected in the clear mirror for 1 round or more
 causes a reflection of a ghostly skeletal warrior to lunge from the 
niche opposite the mirror. The "ghost" appears to draw its sword and 
viciously slash at anyone reflected in the mirror for 5 rounds before it
 leaps back into the niche and through the wall. The "ghost" in the 
reflection and the mirror itself are merely a <i>programmed image</i> made permanent with a <i>permanency</i>
 spell cast here as a prank long ago by Halaster or some other wizard. 
Feel free to ask for initiative rolls and make it appear as though the 
PCs are being attacked by an assailant they can see only in the mirror.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The cloudy mirror and section of wall behind it is a 
mimic standing in the niche. It hopes to catch passersby unawares. The 
mimic was attracted to this corridor by the sound of some adventurers 
smashing the mirrors, and it killed one while the others ran off into 
the dungeon. Seeing the hall as a good hunting ground, the mimic dragged
 the body into another room to eat later and smashed the other mirrors 
in the hall to help hide the blood trail. It also removed the mirror 
frame from the niche it stands in and hid it with the body.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The mimic, who calls himself Squammulsh, sees the PCs as
 an opportunity to add to his larder. Squammulsh attacks the last PC to 
pass in a group of five or fewer. If there are six or more PCs, 
Squammulsh tries to remain hidden and does not attack unless several of 
the PCs appear to be injured.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Squammulsh wants food, not a fight to the death. If it 
adheres to and damages one PC, the mimic attempts to bargain with the 
others, speaking in Common. Squammulsh offers to let the others go if 
they let it have the PC it adhered to, but the mimic can be bargained 
into accepting the PCs' rations so long as it constitutes at least two 
weeks worth of food. (Although hostile at the beginning of the 
encounter, the mimic becomes merely unfriendly when he has a PC as a 
bargaining chip. For the mimic to accept something other than the 
captured PC as a meal, the PCs must change his attitude to friendly or 
better.) Squammulsh is familiar with the taste of wine, and it 
immediately becomes friendly and releases the captured PC if offered 
wineskin or bottle of alcohol.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If overmatched and near death, Squammulsh doesn't bother
 to flee. Instead the mimic wails piteously and begs for its life. In 
exchange for a bottle of wine and some food with each visit, the mimic 
promises to remain in the hall and not attack anyone but merely report 
on who passes through. If supplied at least once a week in this manner, 
the mimic is true to its word, but if the PCs fail to supply the mimic, 
it wanders off into the dungeon in search of food.</p>
<p align="LEFT">PCs who question the mimic about itself find little of 
interest. Squammulsh's first memories are of the dungeon, and it has 
stalked the area in search of food ever since. The mimic possesses 
little sense of direction and has a poor recollection for the layout of 
the complex since it has spent most of its life waiting in rooms rather 
than traveling about too much. It can tell the PCs about its larder and 
the discarded frame in a not-too-distant room, and it recalls a room 
with many pillars where it witnessed a fight between orcs and goblins 
some distance away, but it doesn't know in which direction the pillared 
hall lies. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Squammulsh:</b> See the <i>Monster Manual</i> for a 
description of the mimic. Lacking a mimic miniature? Bend a bit of 
aluminum foil into a 1-inch cube to represent Squammulsh.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The mimic doesn't have any treasure 
with it, but the frames hanging on the walls are worth a fair amount to 
the right buyer. The frames are 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide, and each 
one weighs 30 pounds, making them awkward to carry. A human or similar 
creature can carry only two at a time at most since two mirrors fully 
occupy both hands. Also, although the frames are made of good hard wood,
 the decorations on the frames are delicate and can be broken easily. A 
PC must take a standard action to set down a frame without damaging the 
carvings -- an action which provokes attacks of opportunity. For each 
attack or drop that damages a frame, the frame suffers a 10% reduction 
in value. Each frame has hardness 5 and 40 hit points.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The hall appears to hold sixteen frames (though one of 
them is a mimic), and each frame is worth 60 gp. Finding buyers for all 
the frames could prove difficult, especially the spookier ones, but 
their reputation as artifacts from Undermountain should garner the PCs 
full value from most. The carvings on the frames on the north wall are 
(from east to west): demonic forms, daisies, dolphins and fish 
(permanent image), birds of prey, elves hunting stags, eyes of various 
types and sizes, squirrels in oak trees, and ships on a storm-tossed 
sea. The carvings on the frames on the south wall are (from east to 
west): ghoulish faces, roses, feathers, faces in clouds blowing wind, 
ghoulish faces (the mimic), townspeople performing their crafts, 
acrobats and clowns, and the house insignias of the various noble houses
 of Waterdeep (from a century ago). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b></p>
<ul>
<li>If the PCs are looking for someone or something, the "adventurers" 
the mimic chased off might be connected. Perhaps an item in the piles of
 broken glass, in the mimic's larder, or even within the mimic provides 
some clue for the PCs to use. <br><br></li>
<li>The mimic's larder might have a map that belonged to the mimic's 
last meal. The map could reveal some other portion of the dungeon, an 
entrance or exit from Undermountain, a location in the city above, or 
some other location that might intrigue the PCs.<br><br></li>
<li>The ghostly skeleton in the <i>permanent image</i> might reveal 
something about its creator due to the accoutrements the skeleton 
carries. This might signify the presence of a great foe, it might alert 
the PCs to a real ghostly threat later in the dungeon, or it might be a 
clue deliberately left by a spellcaster in the hopes that someone would 
solve some puzzle of his devising.<br><br></li>
<li> One or several of the mirror frames could be important to a noble 
house in the city. The house might reward the PCs or have the frames 
stolen from the PCs or those to whom the PCs sell the frames.<br><br></li>
<li>The next time the PCs come to the Hall of Mirrors, the mirrors might
 be restored and the broken glass removed. These new mirrors could be 
set in the same frames if the PCs didn't remove them before. They could 
be all new mirrors, this time girded with some magic that makes them 
more difficult to remove or break. The mirrors or a mirror might be a 
magic item. The mirrors might all be illusions that distort their

<p align="left"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
