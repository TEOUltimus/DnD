<p align="left"><i>"Heroes of Loudwater, flock to my banner and let us 
do a good thing for the entire Delimbiyr. Too long has the Hark and his 
brood tormented the tradeways between Loudwater and the Sword Coast. Too
 long has it infected its plague to others. And now there is evidence 
that it wants to expand its territory into our very city. It is the duty
 to all good people to diminish this foe. I go. Who goes with me?"</i></p>
<p align="right">Stedd Rein<br> 13th of Eleint<br> Year of Wild Magic</p>
<p align="left">With these words Stedd Rein, the leader of the Red 
Fellowship, sent a call for all those noble and brave to join him to 
attack the dreaded Hark in his own stronghold – the infamous Dungeon of 
the Hark. High Lord Kalahar Twohands did not directly support Stedd's 
assault on the Hark, but did not move to block it either. When the Order
 of the Jade Blade agreed to join Stedd and take the battle to the 
villain, Kalahar gave his tactic approval.</p>
<p align="left">For those of you who are not familiar with this scourge 
upon the Delimbiyr Vale, the Hark is a legendary wererat bandit lord who
 is said to lair in a series of caves and pits under the High Moor 
called the Dungeon of the Hark. He has haunted our lands for hundreds of
 years, disappearing for a while and returning to raid anew. To my 
knowledge lycanthropy does not give a person longevity, so I suspect 
that the Hark is either a series of separate individuals claiming to be 
the Hark, is undead, has dragon's blood, or is a fiend of some sort. 
There are many other possibilities as well. Currently, the Hark favors 
goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears as his minions, some of whom have been
 affected with lycanthropy. The Hark and his band pose a threat to 
Loudwater and removing him would make the Delimbiyr safer.</p>
<p align="left">Stedd gathered his forces at the old village of 
Moorsedge, which sits at the border of the High Moor where the land 
slopes away down into the Delimbiyr Vale. It is nothing but a ruin now, 
as the Hark's forces have decimated it when they claimed the dark places
 beneath to build the Dungeon of the Hark. Stedd sent the Jade Blade to 
the Worg Warrens which would prevent the wolves from reinforcing the 
Hark, while Stedd and his Red Fellowship attacked him directly in the 
main part of the dungeon.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade found the entrance to the warrens guarded
 by goblins and a large tree with ropes hanging from the branches. They 
engaged the goblins and quickly learned that the tree was alive or 
enchanted, because it attacked them and attempted to strangle them with 
the nooses. After the initial surprise, the adventurers cut the sentries
 down and descended into the warrens where they encountered a drunken 
bugbear and a rat swarm which were both quickly dispatched. Beyond that,
 they surprised a nasty little goblin named Snig the Axe who led a 
bugbear and a group of goblins.</p>
<p align="left">The next chamber contained something unexpected – a 
group of Zhentarim led by a Banite priest. Neither side wasted much time
 with diplomacy, and after a short and vicious battle, the Black Network
 operatives were dead. Among their possessions the Jade Blade found a 
note addressed to the Hark from Felishar Ivasin, the mayor of Orlbar and
 a member of the Zhentarim. Felishar was conspiring with the Hark 
against Loudwater and the Zhentarim that our heroes slew were in the 
dungeon as ambassadors. The note hinted that there was a "young red 
dragon" in the Greycloak Mountains that would soon be within the 
Zhentarim's grasp. The note also made mention that the Hark was from a 
place called Fury's Heart, which is a different plane and the home of 
Malar among other evil gods.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade pressed deeper into the dungeon and came 
across a wererat who was bowing before a large brazier. In the smoke of 
the brazier was the image of a dark-red-skinned goblin with glowing 
green eyes who was telling the bowing wererat to prepare the worgs and 
that he is going to trick Stedd Rein into a tunnel that leads to a mind 
flayer warren while he took a different path out through the Worg 
Warrens. The Hark was coming this way!</p>
<p align="left">The bowing wererat noticed the adventurers and fled into
 the next chamber to warn Uzetuk, a hobgoblin cleric of Malar and the 
Master of the Worg Riders. Uzetuk led a counter-strike against the 
adventurers that consisted of him, the wererat, a couple goblins, and 
some disturbing aberration that was humanoid in form but had a single 
enormous eye dominating its face. The Jade Blade managed to defeat 
Uzetuk and his minions, but it cost them dearly in their supplies and 
health. Attrition was starting to take its toll.</p>
<p align="left">In a nearby cave, our heroes discovered the worgs which 
the Hark was planning on using for his escape. They slew the beasts but 
triggered a trap that caused wolf skeletons to rise and attack them. The
 undead weren't difficult, but it was more time and energy spent, and 
the Jade Blade had little of either left. After this battle, the 
adventures met the final defenders of the Hark: a hobgoblin, more 
goblins, and a bugbear. The battle went poorly for the goblins, so one 
of them opened a door to let in a pack of abyssal maws which savagely 
attacked the adventurers. Maws are some sort of horrific creature from 
another plane, and they seem to be half teeth and half appetite. The 
things chewed into our heroes and nearly swung the battle back in favor 
of the Hark's defenders.</p>
<p align="left">The battle ended and the Jade Blade was victorious, but 
only barely. They were spent. Their healing powers were used, and their 
magic was drained. They were all wounded, and had nothing left to open 
the final door and possibly face the Hark himself. They decided that 
pressing on would lead to nothing but their death. The Jade Blade 
retreated from the dungeon without seeing the Hark.</p>
<p align="left">Do not think that they failed. Oh no. The Jade Blade 
destroyed a large part of the Hark's defenses and slowed his escape. 
Stedd Rein wisely avoided the tunnel that lead to the Underdark and the 
illithids. The raid was a success. The wererat's power was broken and 
his stronghold cleansed. The River Shining would flow past lands that 
did not fear the terror of the Hark.</p>
