<p align="center"><b>Relevant Skill Checks </b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Disable Device DC 20: </b>This result can disable the portcullis trap once it is discovered.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Disable Device DC 29: </b>This result can disable the moving wall or camouflaged pit trap once either is discovered.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Escape Artist DC 30: </b>A PC who succeeds to this 
degree on an Escape Artist check can squeeze through the bars of the 
portcullis trap. See the squeezing rules on page 148 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 A Tiny or smaller creature can automatically squeeze through the trap's
 bars. A Large or larger creature cannot move through the bars.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jump DC (Varies): </b>PCs can make jump checks to 
clear the pit. PCs who delay jumping for too long might be required to 
make a standing Jump check. See the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for Jump rules.</p>
<p align="left">If the portcullis is down, a PC must attempt to grab it,
 the lip of the hallway floor, or the top edge of the fallen trap door 
to avoid falling into the pit at the end of a successful jump (an 
unsuccessful jump lands a PC in the pit). Grabbing requires a DC 15 
Reflex save. If a PC in the hall attempts to grab the jumper, the 
jumping PC gains a +2 bonus on the Reflex save. Failure results in the 
PC plunging into the pit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Search DC 24: </b>PCs must have the trapfinding 
ability to make this check. A PC with the trapfinding ability who 
searches the ceiling area near the entrance to the room finds the 
portcullis trap.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Search DC 24: </b>Non-dwarf PCs must have the 
trapfinding ability to make this check. A PC with the trapfinding 
ability who searches the floor near the entrance to the room finds the 
pit trap. One who searches near the far wall discovers the moving wall 
trap. One who searches the false door discovers it is false.</p>
<p align="left">A dwarf can make this check automatically when he comes 
within 10 feet of the false door, pit trap, or moving wall trap. You 
should secretly roll for any dwarf PCs. A success about either trap 
reveals to the dwarf that it (the floor or wall) seems unstable and that
 it doesn't seem attached to the surrounding room.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spot DC 15:</b> A PC who takes a standard action to 
peer into the dark water can make a Spot check to see what's in it. A 
success to this degree allows a PC to spy a ghoul's flailing arm or 
rotted face just before it becomes hidden by the water again. This brief
 glimpse is enough to allow a PC to know what square the ghoul occupies.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Open Locks DC 25: </b>A success to this degree can open the average quality lock in the false door.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Strength DC 10: </b>This Result allows a PC to aid another (granting a +2 bonus) in the following Strength checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Strength DC 24: </b>This check result allows a PC to 
bend one of the iron bars in the portcullis. This gives PCs trying to 
move through the bars a +5 bonus on their Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Strength DC 30: </b>A Strength check this high allows
 a PC to break one of the iron bars free from its moorings. This allows 
any PC up to Medium size to squeeze through the bars without the need of
 an Escape Artist check. See the squeezing rules on page 148 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. </p>
<p align="left">Alternatively, a PC who makes a Strength check to lift 
the portcullis and gets this result can actually lift the portcullis 
into the ceiling, but the portcullis remains up only if the PC continues
 to make the check on the following rounds or the trap is reset. A PC 
who loses his grip on the raised bars or intentionally lets go without 
them being secured is attacked by the trap as the portcullis comes down 
again. Note that if a bar is bent by the PCs, the portcullis can't be 
lifted until the bar is bent straight again.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Strength DC 20: </b>A Strength check made with this 
result while pulling on the ring attached to the false door rips the 
ring from its moorings. If a PC is using it to hang above the pit at the
 time, the PC falls into the pit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swim DC 15: </b>A PC must succeed at a DC 15 Swim check to move in the rough water of the pit. See the Swim rules in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details.</p>

<p align="LEFT">For this encounter to be most effective, you should 
describe the room as you would any other normal empty room in the 
dungeon. Here is an example:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">This small barren room has a door in the south wall opposite your entrance. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">This room is one grand trap. The door in south wall is 
false. It appears in all respects to be a normal stone door, but the 
door is built into the wall and no passage exists beyond it. It appears 
locked with an average quality lock. A PC can attempt to unlock the lock
 with the Open Locks skill or a <i>knock</i> spell, but this has no 
effect besides unlocking the lock. Pulling on the iron ring to open the 
door proves useless, but allow the PCs to make Strength checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Several traps activate once at least 20 pounds of 
pressure is put on the floor in front of the false door. When this 
happens, read the following text.</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">Suddenly a tremendous boom and crash simultaneously fill
 the room! The northern 10 feet of the floor swings downward and back 
toward the north wall, slamming against it like a door caught in the 
wind. At the same time, a portcullis crashes down blocking the exit from
 the room. An awful stench then hits your noise: an overpowering smell 
of rotted flesh and foul water. Looking into the pit that now yawns on 
the north side of the room, you see a 15-foot drop to some nearly 
opaque, almost black liquid. Something -- a creature, and perhaps more 
than one -- thrashes below the surface.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then you hear a grinding noise behind you. You can see the south wall slowing moving toward the pit. It's going to push you in!</p>
<p align="left"></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">All the following traps have a manual reset lever hidden
 behind a secret panel in a nearby room of your choice (Search DC 20 
reveals the panel). Simply flipping the lever causes the machinery to 
draw back the wall, draw up the portcullis, and lift the trap door in 
the floor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Well-Hidden Portcullis Trap: </b>CR 2; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Atk +10 melee (3d6 piercing); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 29.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Damage applies only to those underneath the portcullis. 
Since the portcullis is placed on a vertice rather than in a square, it 
is likely that only a Large or larger creature can be struck by it. A 
creature struck by the portcullis is considered pinned beneath it until 
the portcullis is lifted.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Moving Wall Trap:</b> CR 2; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; wall moves; Search DC 24; Disable Device DC 29.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The wall moves 0 feet on round of activation and 5 feet 
per round after that (moving at the beginning of the round). It stops 
moving when it meets the north wall (thus sealing the pit shut). Behind 
the leading edge of the wall lies 10 feet of solid stone, so once the 
wall moves over the pit, it's unlikely anyone in the pit will escape 
unless someone finds the lever to reset the trap.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Camouflaged Pit Trap:</b> CR 2; mechanical; location 
trigger; manual reset; DC 20 Reflex save allows a PC to grab the 
portcullis or top edge of the trap door if on the north side, or to grab
 the pit edge if on the south side; 30 feet deep with 15 feet of water 
(0 damage for fall); multiple targets (anyone in the squares of the 
trap); Search DC 24; Disable Device DC 29.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The bottom 15 feet of this pit is filled with diseased 
water. Anyone who falls in the water is exposed to blinding sickness and
 filth fever each round (see page 292 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> for details). The water also contains the creatures in this room: ghouls.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition, the water in the pit has become infused 
with the ghouls' stench, and any creature in the water or within 10 feet
 of its surface must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 
1d6+4 minutes. A creature that makes the save cannot be affected by the 
water's stench for 24 hours, but if a ghoul gets out of the water, its 
stench can affect the PCs normally.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ghouls (6): </b>Use the Ghoul miniature from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965800000">Harbinger</a></i> or the ghoul statistics presented in the <i>Monster Manual</i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Six ghouls float upright 5 feet below the surface of the
 water. They are chained by rusted leg irons to the floor of the pit. 
The ghouls gave up on breaking the chains long ago, and now they're mad 
with hunger. They attack any creature that falls in the water, using 
their natural attacks or grappling the PCs in the hopes of drowning 
them. If a ghoul grapples a PC, the PC is pulled into the ghoul's space 
due to the leg irons preventing the ghoul from moving upward. A PC can 
resist being pulled into the ghoul's space by making a Swim check that 
exceeds the ghoul's grapple check. The Swim check is in addition to the 
normal grapple check to establish a grapple.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The ghouls and any PCs in the water must follow the rules for underwater combat on page 92 and 93 in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide.</i>
 Briefly, fighting underwater causes the ghouls to suffer a -2 penalty 
on attacks and grapple checks. Damage from a ghoul's natural attacks is 
halved, but damage from grapple attacks is not halved. The ghouls must 
make a DC 15 Swim check each round or be considered off-balance (no Dex 
bonus to AC, and foes get +2 to attack it). The ghouls have total cover 
from PCs not in the water (unless the PC is subject to a freedom of 
movement effect). The dark water gives concealment to the PCs and ghouls
 who face one another in it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure: </b>Two items of note lie beneath the water and constitute the treasure: a <i>golembane scarab</i> and a <i>+1 silvered longsword</i>
 (now black with corrosion but still functional). Searching for the 
items by hand is nearly impossible (DC 35 Search check for each) but a <i>detect magic </i>spell and a few rounds of concentration readily reveals their location to the caster.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b></p>
<ul>
<li>You can increase the difficulty of this encounter by putting it in a
 smaller room, changing the type or increasing the number of undead, or 
by increasing the Search and Disable Device DCs associated with the 
traps. <br><br></li>
<li> You can decrease the difficulty of this encounter by doing the 
opposite of the suggestions above and by having the moving wall stop at

<p align="left"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
