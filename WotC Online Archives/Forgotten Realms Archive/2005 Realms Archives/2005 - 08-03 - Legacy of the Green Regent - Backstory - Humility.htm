<p align="left"><i>Dark times had come to Loudwater. Three times in the 
past month, someone had been murdered in the night. As one victim after 
another was found with their heads emptied of brain matter, terror 
gripped the populace. What was the pattern? Who would be next?</i></p>
<p align="right">Teseryne Truesilver<br> Daughter of Talanthe Truesilver<br> Year of Rogue Dragons</p>
<p align="left">Late one chilly autumn night, Lisyil Sweetwhisper 
awakened the members of the Jade Blade. Lisyil is a cousin of mine and 
serves High Lord Kalahar Twohands as his herald. Her voice is true to 
her name, and she has a beautiful fey-like face. Both shielded her from 
angry protests of the Jade Blade as she roused them and told them than 
High Lord Kalahar wished to see them immediately. Sensing the urgency in
 her voice, they set off.</p>
<p align="left">At High Lord's Hall, Lisyil presented the Jade Blade to 
Kalahar and his chancellor Rayler Drenn. Kalahar grimly confirmed the 
rumors of illithid activity within Loudwater. There have been three 
murders over the past month where the brain was removed from the victim.
 Two of the victims were officers of Loudwater while the third was a 
captured Zhentarim agent who was cooperating with authorities. Kalahar 
was concerned that the mind flayers were in league with the Zhentarim as
 the choice of victims benefited the Black Network and both groups had 
dealings with the Hark.</p><img src="2005%20-%2008-03%20-%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Green%20Regent%20-%20Backstory%20-%20Humility_files/frgr20050803a1.jpg" alt="Mind flayers lunch." title="Mind flayers lunch." align="right" border="0" height="307" width="200"><p align="left">More
 immediately, Kalahar was concerned of the safety of Stedd Rein, the 
founder and leader of the Red Fellowship. Kalahar had just dreamed that 
Stedd was in danger. Mielikki would often send him dreams when he was 
the Green Regent and this was the first he had since his reign as her 
champion ended. That she would send him the dream underscored the 
danger. He sent our heroes out immediately to protect Stedd from harm.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade hurried from High Lord's Hall to the Red 
Boar Tavern where Stedd Rein was known to stay, and it was fortunate for
 Stedd that they did so. Kalahar's premonition was accurate, and the 
adventurers arrived to find Stedd under attack by an illithid assassin 
behind the tavern. The hideous monster had already slain five Red 
Fellows, and now he held Stedd by the throat, preparing to extract his 
brain. The Jade Blade leapt to his defense and drove off the monster, 
who escaped into the darkness.</p>
<p align="left">With a shaken Stedd Rain in their care, the Jade Blade 
returned to Kalahar, who decided that Stedd would stay at High Lord’s 
Hall for his protection. Kalahar then asked the adventurers to undertake
 a new mission. He had lost contact with Vendross Thaddren, a spy who 
was keeping an eye on the Zhentarim. Kalahar was afraid that Vendross 
had been captured, and the High Lord asked the adventurers to go to the 
Fortress of the Eternal Despot, the temple of Bane in Orlbar, find out 
if Vendross was there and retrieve him if he was. Kalahar gave the 
adventurers a description as well as the sign and countersign to know 
him. </p>
<p align="left">On the way to Orlbar, the Jade Blade came across a 
merchant caravan under attack by a group of hell hounds. Our heroes 
aided the merchants and slew the beasts, which mysteriously vanished 
into smoke when they died. For those who are not aware, this is a 
taletell-tale sign that the beasts were summoned by magic.</p>
<p align="left">After the merchants departed, a group of Banites lead by
 a priest named Draeth approached our heroes. Tyrant Draeth (tyrant is a
 Banite title) was angry with the Jade Blade for some reason, and he 
verbally abused them throughout the conversation. Somehow a fight did 
not break out, but the two groups parted on poor terms. That night, the 
adventurers were attacked by fiendish dire wolves. When they were slain,
 the creatures also vanished into smoke like the hell hounds. I'm sure 
you've reached the same conclusion I have about these attacks.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade arrived at Orlbar and snuck around the 
village searching for a way into the Fortress of the Eternal Despot, 
which sits on a hill overlooking the town. They eventually found a 
weakness—a culvert that lead into the sewers beneath the temple. As they
 crawled through the culvert, they were attacked by a pair of gricks. 
Once past these beasts, the adventures slew a carrion crawler that 
awaited them deeper inside. </p><img src="2005%20-%2008-03%20-%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Green%20Regent%20-%20Backstory%20-%20Humility_files/frgr20050803a2.jpg" alt="Heart of Bane." title="Heart of Bane." align="right" border="0" height="233" width="278"><p align="left">After
 some time exploring the bowels of the temple, the Jade Blade reached 
the Heart of Bane, which is a cylindrical shaft that plunged nearly a 
hundred feet below them. The walls were pocked with tiny enclosures, 
each holding a black crystal. A walkway, seemingly composed of bone, 
stretched across the open shaft, linking the three doors into the Heart,
 forming a three-pronged star. About thirty feet below the first walkway
 was another similar walkway.</p>
<p align="left">As the adventurers entered, they were challenged by a 
DhanTe, a Monk of the Iron Gauntlet. He demanded to know why they had 
come, but was not particularly interested in their answer. He assumed 
that they had come for the spy and told the Jade Blade that they would 
die here. He clapped his hands and the walkway came to life, forming 
grasping skeletal hands that tore at our heroes. DhanTe was joined by 
three of barghests, and together they attacked the adventurers, 
determined to stop them from rescuing Vendross.</p>
<p align="left">After a difficult battle, the Jade Blade defeated DhanTe
 and found Vendross bound and gagged at the bottom of the Heart of Bane.
 He was eager to flee with the adventurers back to Loudwater. Upon their
 return, they found out that Chancellor Rayler Drenn was missing and 
presumed dead. That night, at a feast in honor of Vendross' rescue, 
Kalahar made him Chancellor of Loudwater, giving him the circlet of 
office.</p>
<p align="left">The day after the feast, Lisyil Sweetwhisper came to the
 Jade Blade with terrible news. Stedd Rein had been slain in the night. 
His skull had been gnawed through and his brain devoured.</p>
