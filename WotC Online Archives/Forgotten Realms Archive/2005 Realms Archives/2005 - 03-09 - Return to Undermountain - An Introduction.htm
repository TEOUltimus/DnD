<p align="left"><i>Undermountain? Ah, yes. A great place to have fun, 
the most famous battlefield in which to earn a reputation as a veteran 
adventurer -- and the largest known mass grave in Faerûn today.</i></p>
<p align="left">-- Elminster of Shadowdale</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2003-09%20-%20Return%20to%20Undermountain%20-%20An%20Introduction_files/ru_cover_sm.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="245" width="195">Undermountain, that seemingly endless dungeon beneath Waterdeep -- mentioned in countless <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 products, detailed in two boxed sets and several adventures, and so 
vast that such efforts barely scratched the surface of its many miles of
 corridors and acres of rooms -- remains one of the most recognizable 
locations in Faerûn. Often called the "deepest dungeon of them all," 
Undermountain has tempted countless adventurers to delve into its 
depths. Some return with tales of its horrors. Most are never seen 
again. Yet enough of those few who return come back with astounding 
wealth to entice others to follow suit and take the chance that the 
halls beneath the mountain become their tomb.</p>
<p align="left">This article series details some of the rooms and halls 
of Undermountain so that you can use them in your game. As with the many
 Undermountain products of the past, this series of articles cannot hope
 to detail every room and corridor of the vast dungeon beneath 
Waterdeep. Instead, it will detail individual rooms and encounters that 
you can use when you run adventurers through Undermountain or any 
dungeon of your own devising.</p>
<p align="left">TSR published <i>The Ruins of Undermountain</i>, the 
original boxed set describing the first three levels, in 1991. A few 
things have changed since then. Fans of the old dungeon description will
 find some new encounters, recognize some old favorites, and be 
surprised by some new twists. For those new to Undermountain, this 
introduction acts as a primer, telling you what you need to know to 
imperil PCs' lives in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> setting's most famous dungeon.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>How to Use Undermountain </b></p>
<p align="left">This articles series presents the map of the first level
 of Undermountain and describes a few rooms within it each month. These 
dungeon rooms share Undermountain as a linking theme, but you can easily
 take them out of this context and place them into any adventure of your
 making. If you want to use Undermountain as a setting for your PCs' 
adventures beneath Waterdeep, don't wait for all the articles before you
 get started. You can use the map and the first few rooms as a starting 
point for adventures you devise, and if a future room description 
contradicts your version, you can incorporate the room in another part 
of the dungeon or have the room change to fit the new description, 
presenting a surprise to your players.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>A Short History of Undermountain </b></p>
<p align="left">Over a thousand years ago, the wizard Halaster 
Blackcloak whirled to the base of Mount Waterdeep, called there from a 
distant country by chance or providence. Some say he hailed from the 
Cradlelands, the nearly forgotten empire that spread humanity across 
Faerûn and Kara-Tur from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a 
wasteland created by conflict with the gods. Whatever his origins, 
scholars record that Halaster brought with him the Seven, as his 
apprentices are known, and with their help and his power, Halaster 
summoned beings from other planes to build himself a wizard's tower. 
Halaster ringed his tower with a great wall set with lesser towers for 
each of his apprentices, and he created fields and farms to be worked by
 his apprentices and their servants.</p>
<p align="left">For a time, it seemed a good life for the Seven, but as 
the days wore on, they saw less and less of their dread master. Halaster
 continued to use fell creatures from other planes for construction 
beneath his tower, and he kept his dealings with them and the nature of 
the tunnels from the Seven. At length, Halaster's tunneling broke into 
the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels built by dwarves around a mithral 
mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The dwarves who built the dungeons, the 
Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, replaced by 
oft-times warring duergar and drow. Halaster began a crusade against 
both races, participating in wild hunts through the tunnels with allies 
called from the Outer Planes. The duergar stubbornly remained until the 
mithral was largely mined out, but then they left the drow to fight 
Halaster and his minions alone. Halaster captured or killed the 
remaining dark elves, entrapping their souls for dark magic or twisting 
their bodies and enslaving their minds. When the last of the drow were 
defeated, Halaster Blackcloak tunneled on, ever downward, continuing his
 strange obsession with delving beneath the mountain.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, when Halaster was absent for more than a year, 
some of his apprentices ventured into his tower in search of the great 
wizard. They found traps, monsters, and tantalizing hints about power 
beneath the earth. Individually they plumbed the depths of the dungeons,
 encountering evermore-deadly traps and more powerful foes. For their 
efforts, they were rewarded with riches and magic. When the Seven were 
reduced to five, Halaster appeared to his students and explained that he
 had built the tunnels to guard his experiments and treasures. He 
enlisted their aid to make his dungeons even more secure.</p>
<p align="left">What happened after that is unclear, but only one 
apprentice is known to have left Undermountain, and she fled the area, 
never to return. Halaster continued to live beneath the mountain, using 
it as a base from which he traveled to other planes and distant lands, 
entrapping strange creatures and bringing them back to live as prisoners
 or guardians in his home. In time, Halaster sought out magic to extend 
his life, and some say that it was these spells and items that finally 
drove Halaster beyond all reason. While before he had been obsessed and 
deranged, his quest for immortality seemed to drive him truly mad.</p>
<p align="left">While Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered 
himself in his tunnels, his tower fell into ruin. When Halaster was yet 
active in the outside world, his home was considered an accursed place, 
so settlers in the area largely left the crumbling tower alone. In time,
 the city now known as Waterdeep came to huddle against the mountain and
 reach down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward, it reached and 
encompassed the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to 
these early settlers, and they often punished criminals by sending them 
into its depths. So it was for many years until an adventurer named 
Durnan delved into the depths beneath the tower and returned, laden with
 riches, to tell the tale. Durnan demolished the last remnants of 
Halaster's above-ground abode and built an inn over the well he had used
 to descend into the depths. He called his inn the Yawning Portal, and 
Durnan works there to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave 
or the foolish to try their hands at the halls of Undermountain.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Reasons to Enter Undermountain </b></p>
<p align="left">If riches and power aren't enough to entice your 
players' PCs to try their luck in Undermountain, there exist countless 
other options to get them involved. Presented below are a few ideas for 
how to get their adventures beneath Waterdeep started.</p>
<ul>
<li>A nobleman ventured into Undermountain and has been gone for a week.
 Divinations revealed he is alive and held captive in the dungeon 
complex, but attempts to divine his exact location have failed. His 
house offers a tremendous reward for someone to rescue him.<br><br></li>
<li>One of the PCs' long-time foes ventures into Undermountain along 
with a captive, magic item, or holy relic important to the PCs. Their 
only hope of regaining what they've lost is to follow.<br><br></li>
<li>If the PCs rack up a great debt, someone might call in that debt and
 offer Undermountain as a means of quickly gaining enough for payment.<br><br></li>
<li>Other adventurers challenge the PCs to enter Undermountain with 
them, betting their takings from the dunegons against the PCs' with the 
group who amassed the most taking all. If the PCs refuse, the other 
adventurers call them cowards, and their bard makes up some catchy tunes
 about the party's lack of courage.<br><br></li>
<li>If the PCs run into trouble with the law or with a criminal 
organization, they might be sent into Undermountain as punishment. 
Capital punishments are sometimes commuted to just such a penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Ways In and Out </b></p>
<p align="left">Many ways lead into Undermountain and few ways lead out.
 Many seeming exits just lead farther into the maze, and many traps dump
 their victims in deeper levels of the dungeon. A future article might 
detail some of the many exits and entrances to Faerûn's largest mass 
grave, but this series assumes the PCs enter and exit by one: the well 
at the Yawning Portal Inn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Yawning Portal </b></p>
<p align="left">The Yawning Portal, famous for holding the entrance to 
Undermountain, stands in Waterdeep on Rainrun Street in the upper part 
of the Dock Ward. It's a must-see location for many visitors to the 
great city, and many adventurers use it as their starting point and 
refuge during their dungeon plumbing. </p>
<p align="left">Built on the site of Halaster's tower, the Yawning 
Portal is a rambling structure strewn with blue tapestries. Food at the 
inn is decent and prices for room and board are fair. Durnan (NG male 
Ftr18) built the Yawning Portal with wealth taken from the 
Undermountain, and he has run the inn since his retirement from 
adventuring more than seventy years ago. Now approaching a hundred years
 of age, the white-haired Durnan is nevertheless a powerful presence 
behind the bar, and many consider him an institution in Waterdeep. With 
muscles like catapult shots and a greatsword hung among the racks of 
mugs and bottles, few make trouble in the inn, and those who do quickly 
come to regret it. The local toughs and bravos know better than to set 
foot in the Yawning Portal, and newcomers to the inn receive a friendly 
welcome from other patrons along with an admonishment about fighting or 
casting spells. Durnan asks those who do come to conflict to leave the 
inn, ejecting them if they refuse. A few off-duty city guards are 
usually in the taproom, and they call on their fellows to arrest any 
brawlers, whether inside or outside. As a result of Durnan's influence 
and the attraction of the entrance to the dungeon, having dinner or a 
drink at the Yawning Portal remains a relatively safe and entertaining 
way to spend time, and many local laborers and merchants rub shoulders 
with the exotic foreigners and adventurers drawn to the place.</p>
<p align="left">The centerpiece of the taproom is a wide well with a low
 wall. This is the "yawning portal" and the entrance to Undermountain. 
The well is surrounded by everburning torches, and a large 
winch-and-pulley construction hangs a rope over a 140-foot drop into the
 dungeon. Entrance to Undermountain costs 1 gp. Durnan happily lowers 
any paying patron into the well by means of the winch and a long length 
of silk rope. Durnan doesn't like lowering more than one person on the 
rope at a time, although he'll make exceptions for Small characters and 
exceptionally light individuals. If someone insists on being lowered 
with more weight than Durnan thinks the rope can hold, the innkeeper 
asks that the party pay for a replacement for the rope in advance, and 
should it break on the way down, Durnan hollers an "I told you so" to 
the falling adventurer -- much to the amusement of his patrons. Those 
who make use of the well without paying earn Durnan's ire, and he 
refuses to raise them out of the well without having them first tie 
their wealth and gear -- everything but underclothes -- to the rope. 
Durnan then keeps the wealth and holds the gear and items until the 
adventurer can afford to buy them back at a fair price or pay 1,000 gp, 
whichever is less.</p>
<p align="left">If an adventurer returns to the well and wants to come 
back up, he must have 1 gp to pay Durnan. Those who can't pay must give 
Durnan their gear, paying Durnan 500 gp or the cost of their gear before
 he returns the items. If someone refuses Durnan's terms or attempts to 
leave without paying, Durnan either leaves them at the bottom of the 
well or forcibly puts them back down there. The 140-foot drop convinces 
most folk that embarrassment and poverty is the preferable option.</p>
<p align="left">Durnan provides other services to adventurers. In 
addition to providing food and libation, he rents rooms and storage 
lockers, and he keeps some dungeoneering essentials on hand to sell to 
those who might have forgotten something in their preparations. Use the 
prices for equipment, edibles, and inn stays as provided in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
 Durnan charges 5 gp a day for use of a storage locker, and he requires 
payment up front. He sells the items stored within if a person doesn't 
return to take them. This might seem steep, but few safer places exist 
within the city to store wealth and goods than with Durnan. Durnan also 
sells healing potions provided to him through the temple of Tymora in 
the city. He charges the price in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> 
since he buys them in bulk at a discount. Durnan doesn't provide other 
healing or help to returning adventurers, but he'll send a runner with a
 message to one of the temples for free. (He considers such a small 
service to be paid for by the PCs' entrance fee and the entertainment 
they provide to his patrons simply by choosing to delve into the 
dungeons.)</p>
<p align="left">When adventurers pay to enter the well, patrons cheer, 
share rounds of drinks, and generally give the heroes a grand going-away
 party. For those not distracted by the celebration, the scene might 
seem a bit grisly as customers at the inn and those working there openly
 bet on whether or not the adventurers will return, in what state 
they'll return, and how many might come back. Adventurers are not 
allowed to participate in this betting.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Powers of Halaster </b></p>
<p align="left">Halaster (male human Wiz25/Acm5, detailed in the <i>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting</i> and updated in <i>Epic Level Handbook</i>)
 still roams the halls of Undermountain and views them from a secret 
base unreachable from the dungeon's tunnels. In past products, 
Halaster's influence provided an explanation for traps resetting, 
monsters being replaced, and to obstruct the use of certain types of 
magic. You can use Halaster's powers in a similar manner, but such 
things can be frustrating to players, so employ such tactics with 
caution. </p>
<p align="left">These articles assume that Halaster's influence is felt in just one manner: a<i> teleport cage</i> (see <i>City of Splendors: Waterdeep</i>,
 to be released in July, for a spell description) that encompasses all 
of Undermountain. When a conjuration (teleportation) spell is cast 
within Undermountain, the spell transports all affected creatures and 
objects to another random location within Undermountain. When a caster 
outside Undermountain attempts to teleport into it, the effect redirects
 their destination to another random location reachable by the spell. 
For example, if a 9th-level wizard in Waterdeep attempted to <i>teleport</i> into the depths of Undermountain, the <i>teleport cage</i>
 would cause him to appear at another random location within 900 miles 
of the place where he cast the spell. This effect is well known, and 
Durnan warns adventurers of it before winching them down.</p>
<p align="left">Here are some other possibilities for Halaster's influence that might make adventures in Undermountain unique.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spells that alter the dungeon, such as <i>passwall</i> or <i>stoneshape, </i>fail or go wild.<br><br></li>
<li>Divination magic of various types, such as <i>scrying</i> and magic that locates objects or creatures, fails or goes wild.<br><br></li>
<li>The whole dungeon might radiate powerful obscuring magic, making <i>detect magic</i> useless as a means of discovering magic traps.<br><br></li>
<li>Traps reset after a designated a period of time.<br><br></li>
<li>Portals open at random, sometimes depositing monsters in rooms thought to be empty.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Dungeon Features </b></p>
<p align="left">This section describes assumptions about the features of
 Undermountain. See the Undermountain Cheat Sheet sidebar for statistics
 you might like to keep handy when running adventurers through one of 
the rooms described in this series of articles.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Map Squares:</b> Note that squares on the large Undermountain map represent 10-foot squares, just as they did in the original <i>Ruins of Undermountain</i> boxed set. In the maps of each room that accompany the articles, squares represent normal 5-foot squares.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Climate:</b> The temperature in the dungeons tends to
 be a little chilly, but dungeon delvers don't require more than typical
 adventuring garb. Parts of the dungeon are dank and moldy while others 
are dry and dusty. Some parts of Undermountain vary greatly from the 
norm, and in such cases, the room description will note this. Many 
sources of fresh air lead into the various levels of Undermountain, and 
unless otherwise noted, the air in the dungeons is clean apart from 
occasional dustiness or dampness.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ceilings:</b> Unless otherwise noted, ceilings in 
rooms are 10 feet above the floor. Although once constructed of smooth 
stone, most ceilings bear the cracks and pock mocks from centuries of 
age and countless battles. Unless otherwise noted, PCs can climb 
ceilings (hanging from hands) with a DC 25 climb check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Floors:</b> Most floors in Undermountain rooms 
consist of relatively smooth stone or flagstones. Neither floor type 
requires special rules for movement.</p>
<p align="left">Floors in caverns should be considered hewn stone 
floors. A character running or charging on a hewn stone floor must make a
 DC 10 Balance check or be unable to run or charge (the character can 
still act normally).</p>
<p align="left">Other floor types exist in Undermountain, and when 
necessary, their description will appear in the description of a room. 
For more information on floors, see page 60 of the <i>Dungeon Master</i>'<i>s Guide</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Walls:</b> Halaster and the dwarves and drow before 
him constructed Undermountain of walls of superior masonry. Cavern walls
 are typically unworked. Both have a Climb DC of 20, 15 hit points per 
inch of thickness, and a hardness of 8.</p>
<p align="left">Thin walls between rooms are 1 foot thick and have 90 
hit points (half normal) because they lack the support of bedrock behind
 them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Doors:</b> Unless otherwise noted, doors in 
Undermountain are 4 inches thick, 5 feet wide, and made of stone. They 
sit and hang on pins on one side, usually the left side if one pushes 
the door open. Doors open into rooms from hallways, and into smaller 
rooms from larger ones, as a rule of thumb.</p>
<p align="left">Stone doors have hardness 8, 60 hit points, and a break 
DC of 28 whether stuck or locked. All doors have built-in good locks (DC
 30 Open Lock check to lock or unlock), but keys are largely missing, 
and locks are often broken. Unless other wise noted, doors are not 
locked or barred. </p>
<p align="left">For more information about dungeon doors, see page 60 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. For more information about locks, see page 61.</p>
<p align="left">Doors line up with a 5-foot square even though the main Undermountain map indicates they would straddle a line between squares.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Secret Doors:</b> In general, secret doors consist of
 stone made to blend in with the surrounding walls. The typical secret 
door can be found with a DC 20 Search check, and it might or might not 
have a lock or even be opened from the side the PCs stand on. Remember 
that dwarves receive a free Search check to note unusual stonework, and 
elves get a free Search check to find secret or concealed doors.</p>
<p align="left">Secret doors line up with a 5-foot square even though 
the main Undermountain map indicates they would straddle a line between 
squares.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Light and Darkness:</b> Most of Undermountain remains
 unlit by any light source, but some rooms and halls might be lit by 
ancient magic or recent inhabitants. Room descriptions assume the PCs 
can see about 60 feet in darkness, so be sure to modify your description
 of the room if the PCs can see a shorter or farther distance in the 
dark. Also, recall that darkvision is in black and white.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Listen Checks:</b> Remember that PCs passing near a 
door, secret door, or hall to a room with some activity in it might have
 an opportunity to hear what's happening on the other side. Similarly, 
creatures in distant rooms or passages have a chance to hear the PCs. 
See page 78 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for modifiers to Listen checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spot Checks: </b>Spot checks function normally in 
Undermountain, but remember that PCs can see only as far as their light 
sources reveal or their darkvision allows.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Random Encounters:</b> A future article might detail random encounters particular to Undermountain, but for now, use the rules presented in the <i>Dungeon Master</i>'<i>s Guide</i>
 on page 78. You can roll for a random encounter as often as you like, 
but keep in mind the party's condition and how the number of random 
encounters can affect how populated the dungeon seems to be. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Telportation:</b> Conjuration (teleportation) spells 
transport all affected creatures and objects to another random location 
within Undermountain. When a caster outside Undermountain attempts to 
teleport into it, the effect redirects their destination to another 
random location reachable by the spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Traps:</b> Traps of endless variety litter 
Undermountain's halls and rooms. Some traps exist merely to move dungeon
 delvers deeper into the dungeon or to get them lost. A future article 
might detail traps in Undermountain; for now, use the traps described in
 the <i>Dungeon Master</i>'<i>s Guide.</i> When using traps, keep in 
mind their effect on the pace of the game; one hidden pit or arrow trap 
can cause the PCs to slow to a crawl as they check every step for hidden
 danger.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Map </b></p>
<p align="left">This poster map of the Ruins of Undermountain measures 
approximately 30"x22" and can be printed on one sheet of paper on a

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Future Articles</b></p>
<p align="left">In addition to dungeon rooms and encounters, future 
articles might detail random encounters, traps, and dungeon dressings 
particular to Undermountain. For now, use Tables 3-18 through 3-21 
beginning on page 78 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Better Adventures in Undermountain </b></p>
<p align="left">Several products will make your adventures in 
Undermountain more fun and more detailed. Check out the following books 
for excellent ideas and great inspiration to add depth and detail to 
your PCs' dungeon delvings.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting: </i>In addition to
 describing Waterdeep and the surrounding area, this book contains NPC 
statistics for Halaster and a few other noteworthy characters who might 
be met in Undermountain.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Epic Level Handbook:</i> This book contains updated statistics for Halaster Blackcloak.</p>
<p align="left"><i>City of Splendors: Waterdeep:</i> To be published in July, <i> City of Splendors: Waterdeep </i>
 details the city above Undermountain and describes the history of 
Undermountain and surrounding area in great detail. It's the perfect 
resource for a campaign in the great dungeon, and using it is an 
excellent way to have both city adventures and dungeon crawls at your 
fingertips. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Underdark:</i><i>Underdark</i> describes the 
inhabitants that dwell in the Underdark near Undermountain as well as 
giving great descriptions and advice for spelunking adventures.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Dungeon Master's Guide II:</i> Chapters in this book 
include advice about running a game and designing adventures. Ready-made
 game elements include instant traps, pregenerated locations, and 
treasures.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Stronghold Builder's Guidebook:</i> Although not designed for the revised edition of the game, the <i>Stronghold Builder's Guidebook</i>
 offers tons of great inspiration for dungeon design, from magical 
locations to magic augmentations on walls and floors that would send 
shivers down any adventurer's spine.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Lords of Darkness: Lords of Darkness </i>presents 
many different factions, large and small, that could be antagonists in 
the PCs adventures in Undermountain. Whether you want the PCs to meet 
slavers or assassins, a thieves' guild or a cabal of necromancers, <i>Lords of Darkness</i> offers many tantalizing options.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Using Undermountain with Other Campaign Settings </b></p>
<p align="left">You can use the rooms described in these articles in 
dungeons of your own devising, but you can also adapt all of 
Undermountain for use in your campaign, whether or not you run a game in
 the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Eberron:</b> Undermountain could be part of the 
depths of Sharn, or it could be a complex on the continent of Xen'drik. 
In Sharn, the wide scope of the dungeon means that it would have to be 
part of the deepest foundations of the city. In Xen'drik, you could 
raise the ceilings in Undermountain to 20 or 30 feet high and make the 
halls the work of giants and later expansions by drow. <i>Sharn: City of Towers</i> is an excellent resource for using Undermountain with Sharn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Greyhawk:</b> Countless locations exist that could 
host the halls of Undermountain. Perhaps the Undermountain map 
represents a lost level of the dungeons of Castle Greyhawk, or maybe 
Maure Castle has depths beneath the known levels.</p>

<p align="left"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
