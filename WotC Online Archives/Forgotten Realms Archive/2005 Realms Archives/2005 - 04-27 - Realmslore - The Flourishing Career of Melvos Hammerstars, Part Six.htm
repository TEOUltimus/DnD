<p align="left"><b>The Likable Lender</b></p>
<p align="left">In all of his shady business ventures, Melvos 
Hammerstars makes modest coin regularly. He knows that the greedy get 
caught. The authorities are so overwhelmed by business deceptions going 
on all around them that (unless ordered to make an example of a 
particular individual) they tend to let the small and subtle pass, in 
return for pouncing on the "big ones" (which earns them the most 
approval from superiors).</p>
<p align="left">We've seen his activities as a landlord. Hammerstars 
also indulges in what most Sembian merchants except the very wealthy 
practice on a daily basis: <i>cointossing.</i></p>
<p align="left">Cointossing is the practice of making short-term loans 
(entirely informal, with no paperwork and high interest fees). Small 
shopkeepers with cash-flow troubles have no choice but to try to find 
someone to lend them a few coins for a few days, to get in goods 
(particularly perishables such as food) they couldn't otherwise afford, 
that they must buy <i>right now</i>. (A Sembian who suspects he's being 
watched will often ask for a cointoss to pay off a debt he's being 
pressured to pay, purely to avoid revealing his own sources of income to
 spies.)</p>
<p align="left">Cointoss loan amounts are small, but the interest is 
typically as high as one-quarter of the principal. Borrowers are willing
 to accept such terms for two reasons: They can largely conceal how 
desperate their personal finances are, and such interest rates are as 
little as half what licensed moneylenders charge for short-term, 
high-risk loans.</p>
<p align="left">While there's no such thing as a Sembian moneylender 
free from greed, the extremely stiff rates they charge aren't all 
profit: moneylending is one of the activities that the government does 
tax. (They also regulate it through exhaustive contracts composed of 
clauses drawn up by government officials that licensed moneylenders are 
legally required to use; a contract is typically assembled by picking 
and choosing clauses, but the clauses themselves can't be altered by 
borrower or lender without hiring an expensive government agent to 
approve such "variances.")</p>
<p align="left">Sembia holds many moneylenders and countless investors, 
but very few private bankers now exist. During the last three decades, 
the government has been busily winnowing their ranks by granting no new 
banking licenses and revoking licenses held by individuals when they die
 (rather than allowing heirs and creditors to take over the licenses). 
Although the average Sembian views this as one more "robbery by 
government" (all deposits carry a flat 10-sp fee, regardless of amount, 
and withdrawals are likewise subject to a 20-sp fee), this change was 
actually instituted to cut down on slaughter-thefts (and the hiring of 
wizards at ever-higher fees for personal protection, or to attack 
protected persons). Such slayings were escalating to fearsome levels 
thanks to almost every city-dwelling Sembian's need to carry and store 
large sums of coinage at all times, just to engage in everyday life. The
 creation of hard-to-counterfeit magical seals government officials 
could affix to officially issued, redeemable <i>tallies</i> (we might 
call them government-issued checks or IOUs; most take the form of small,
 palm-sized electrum plaques) made possible transfers of large sums of 
money without chests of coinage being involved. Tallies can be redeemed 
only by the person they were issued to, in the presence of any 
government banker, anywhere in Sembia, and so are worthless if stolen. 
When large debts are to be paid (particularly if the debtor wants 
witnesses to the payment being made), debtors often take a tally for the
 correct amount to a government banker with the creditor, and the banker
 cancels the first tally and issues a second one to the creditor. 
(Government fees for tally transactions are the same as for coin 
deposits and withdrawals.)</p>
<p align="left">Hammerstars has built up enough money to do as many of 
the self-styled nobles in the land and other very wealthy Sembians do: 
engage in cointossing for amounts large enough that he could be said to 
be the equivalent of a private banker -- only without the license, 
contracts, and government scrutiny (of both the transactions and his 
fees, which for bankers are government-controlled). This sort of 
cointossing is backed by documents, but not government contracts: 
Instead, the borrower writes up a claim stating that the rents for a 
property, or the proceeds from the market sale of a particular cargo, or
 (if desperate) the deed to a property, are to be transferred to the 
lender, and gives it to the borrower. When the loan is repaid, the 
document is returned (or borrower and lender burn it together).</p>
