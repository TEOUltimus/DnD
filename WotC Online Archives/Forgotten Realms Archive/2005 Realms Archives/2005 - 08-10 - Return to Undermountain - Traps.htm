 thinking about putting traps in your dungeons, you might imagine 
something from one of the Indiana Jones movies. The dramatic tension of 
the trap being sprung and the tense action of the heroes trying to 
escape it make for great cinema. Unfortunately, traps in <b>D&amp;D</b> work more like designers intend them to work -- as impediments.</p>
<p align="left">An individual puts a trap in place to injure, slow, kill, or capture someone else, and traps in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 work precisely like that -- except they're often having those effects 
on your game in addition to the PCs. Traps make many players slow their 
dungeon delve to a crawl as they tentatively check every door, chest, 
and square of floor they encounter. The event is so common that the 
10-foot pole (for poking at potential traps) and taking 10 minutes to 
open a door have become clichés.</p>
<p align="left">Even if your group of players isn't the type to let a couple of traps slow them down, traps can ruin your game.</p>
<p align="left">Traps usually come in two varieties: game pausing and 
game stopping. A game-pausing trap deals some damage or causes some 
other deleterious effect that the PCs can remedy with a few rounds of 
actions and spellcasting. The trap goes off, affects a PC or two, and 
then the PCs use some of their resources to recover. The net effect of 
the trap was simply to put the real action of the adventure on pause for
 a while. A game-stopping trap kills a PC or has an effect that makes 
the players stop and rest. These traps essentially stop the game as your
 players retreat to a place of safety or leave the dungeon altogether. 
Both types of traps make the game less fun. Instead of putting tense 
action in your game, they give you aggravated and bored reaction.</p>
<p align="left">Add to all this the fact that PCs often possess the means to detect, disarm, and avoid traps.</p>
<p align="left">For these reasons many DMs avoid putting traps in their 
adventures, but what's a dungeon without devious devices to bedevil the 
PCs?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Good Traps </b></p>
<p align="left">Good traps increase the dramatic tension in your game 
and create action. They make sense in the dungeon, and they help move 
the adventure farther on its course. When thinking about including a 
trap in your adventure, think about the classic questions: who, what, 
where, when, how, and why, and then think about the action that should 
take place because of the trap.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Who:</b> Who put the trap there? The trap will work 
differently, have a special purpose, and look different depending on who
 put it in place. A dwarf's pit trap should be distinct from one built 
by drow. Considering who built the trap and having that be meaningful 
will add flavor to the encounter with the trap and inform the players 
and their PCs about the environment of the adventure.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What:</b> What kind of trap is it? Is it intended to 
injure, slow, kill, or capture? What effect is it likely to have on the 
PCs? Answering these questions will help you determine if the trap 
you're thinking of using is game pausing, game stopping, or good.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Where:</b> Where is the trap? Think about how the 
placement of the trap affects your players' mindsets. Placing a trap on a
 treasure chest might make the players suspicious of other chests they 
find in the dungeon, but that's much better than a trap placed on a 
random square in a hall, because the square in the hall makes the 
players suspicious of every place they walk.</p>
<p align="left"><b>When:</b> When was the trap placed there? Maybe the 
trap is so old that it jams when the PCs set it off, giving the tension 
of the trap without the negative repercussions and perhaps giving them 
some overconfidence. Maybe a wandering monster already set it off. When 
is it reset? Maybe the PCs have a chance to encounter the trap keeper on
 his rounds of checking and oiling traps. When does the trap come into 
play based on the pace of the adventure? If you put a deadly trap on the
 door to the dragon's lair, the players might just turn around and leave
 rather than face the dragon after getting hit with the trap.</p>
<p align="left"><b>How:</b> How do the PCs avoid the trap? How does the 
person who put the trap there avoid it? How does the trap work in the 
confines of the dungeon? If it's a mechanical trap, how does someone get
 at its mechanism when it needs fixing or resetting? How was it built? 
Answering these questions can inform the construction of the dungeon and
 your placement of the trap, and it can give you something interesting 
to tell the players when the rogue makes her Search or Disable Device 
check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Why:</b> Why are you putting the trap in the 
adventure? Why did some dungeon inhabitant put it there? Why does it 
work like you want it to work? Knowing the answer to these questions 
makes your inclusion of the trap make sense to the players' 
understanding of the world and assures you that the trap does what you 
want it to.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Action:</b> What happens if the trap is set off? What
 can the PCs do if that happens? If they just make a couple of rolls and
 take some damage, it's probably not a good trap by itself in the 
dungeon. Yet if that trap is in a room where the PCs have to fight some 
enemies, that boring, game-pausing trap can be a tactical element to the
 battlefield that the PCs and their foes try to use to their advantage. 
Traps work best when they create drama or heighten drama. A trap on a 
door or in a hallway is unlikely to do that.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Using Traps from the </b><i> Dungeon Master<b>'s Guide</b></i><b></b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2008-10%20-%20Return%20to%20Undermountain%20-%20Traps_files/fr20050810b_WaterTrap.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="233" width="241">The <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>
 presents many interesting traps, but without some creativity, all of 
them have the potential to be mere game-pausing traps and many could be 
game stoppers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Attack Traps: </b>Traps that just make attack rolls 
and deal damage work best as an addition to an encounter with something 
else. Think of them as spice added to the main course. Perhaps the PCs 
encounter a monster in a room with scything blades that swing from the 
ceiling when the PCs or the monster steps on the wrong square. Maybe the
 PCs have to run through a hall that fires poisoned darts so that they 
can escape a cave-in.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blocking Traps:</b> Blocking traps prevent the PCs' 
access to a location. A cave-in, a falling portcullis, or a sliding wall
 are all examples of blocking traps you might employ against the PCs. 
Blocking traps can make an encounter more difficult by dividing the PCs 
or giving a villain a means of escape. They can also direct the PCs 
movement through a dungeon. Be careful not to be heavy-handed with 
blocking traps. You shouldn't use them to railroad the PCs on a 
particular path.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Capture Traps:</b> Capture traps hold one or all the 
PCs trapped. A capture trap might take the form of a room that seals 
closed once the PCs enter, a burst of paralyzing gas, or any other trap 
that incapacitates but does not kill. Usually, some foes of the PCs come
 by to take them captive once the trap is set off. Be judicious about 
when to use such traps. No one taking the PCs captive would leave them 
with their equipment, and players often hate having their PCs' equipment
 taken more than having their characters die. Use capture traps rarely.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pit Traps:</b> Try not to use pit traps in a combat 
encounter unless the pits are relatively easy to get out of or they add 
to the encounter by giving those who fall in the pits something else to 
fight. If the PCs encounter a pit trap while walking through the 
dungeon, use the trap as a means of propelling the adventure forward 
instead of pausing it. Perhaps a secret door is at the bottom of the 
pit, or maybe a past victim of the pit lies at the bottom with a partial
 map of the dungeon. Think of pit traps as an appetizer for the main 
course of your adventure.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Saving Throw Traps:</b> Traps that require a saving throw and then deal damage are like attack traps. Use them as spice in an encounter.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Using Traps from the </b><i>Dungeon Master<b>'s Guide II</b></i></p>
<p align="left">The <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide II</i> presents several new traps. Many fall into the categories noted above, but a few offer some interesting alternatives.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Booby Trap:</b> The booby traps make great spice in 
an encounter. In particular, the knockback trap becomes a lot more 
interesting if there's a pit or fire into which a PC can be knocked.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fire or Water Summoning Trap:</b> These traps are 
encounters all by themselves. Using these traps as a pattern, you could 
have a cave-in trap that summons an earth elemental.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Haunting Trap:</b> The haunting trap presents a great
 way to bring into the rules the spooky atmosphere of a place frequented
 by undead. Several haunting traps throughout a haunted location could 
make it seem very unnatural and unnerving.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Turret:</b> Like the fire summoning trap, the 
spell turret trap can be its own encounter complete with monsters. Such a
 trap might even cast several summoning spells and bring in guardian 
creatures to delay the PCs while the real guards come running due to the
 sound of combat.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Classic Traps of Undermountain </b></p>
<p align="left"><i><img src="2005%20-%2008-10%20-%20Return%20to%20Undermountain%20-%20Traps_files/fr20050810b_trapcards.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="318" width="200">Ruins of Undermountain</i> presented several new traps on handy reference cards. Many of the traps from that product now appear in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>
 but under different names. Here are updates to the current rules for 
the rest of the traps. You'll find trap statistics first (if any), 
followed by descriptions and other information.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Falling Door Trap:</b> CR 2; mechanical; touch 
trigger; manual reset; Atk +10 melee (4d6 bludgeoning); multiple 
targets; DC 15 Reflex save avoids being caught under the door, assuming 
the affected creature can move to an adjacent unaffected square; 
creatures caught under the door can be freed by a DC 20 Strength check 
or they can free themselves with a DC 20 Escape Artist check; Search DC 
20; Disable Device DC 20.</p>
<p align="left">The falling door trap takes effect when someone pulls on
 the handle to open the door. The 10-foot tall door falls toward the 
opener and affects any creatures in the squares in front of the door and
 the square beyond that square.</p>
<p align="left"><b>False Bait Pit Trap:</b> The false bait pit trap 
combines an obvious pit trap with scything blade traps in the wall. The 
PCs encounter the obvious signs of a pit trap, such as a slab of stone 
different from others in the dungeon, but they can see what looks like a
 narrow ledge of safe stone around the cover of the pit. If the PCs edge
 around the pit, the hidden scything blade traps come out of the walls 
to strike the PCs while they are balancing on the narrow safe area. PCs 
who fail their Balance checks due to damage suffered fall onto the pit 
trap and suffer its effects.</p>
<p align="left">To replicate this trap, simply combine two traps from the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide:</i>
 the CR 2 pit trap (now CR 1 because it is so obvious) with the CR 1 
scything blade trap. This makes the traps an EL 2 encounter.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Green Slime Door Trap:</b> CR 4; mechanical; touch 
trigger; manual reset; never miss (character covered in green slime; 1d6
 Con); onset delay (1 round [to scrape off]-- see page 76 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> for more information); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20.</p>
<p align="left">Tampering with the door causes hatches on it to open and spill out green slime in the square in front of the door.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inhabited Pit Trap:</b> This pit is inhabited by a swarm! Simply combine any pit trap from the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>
 and any swarm to create a scary pit-trap encounter. It works best if 
the pit is 10 feet wide. Use the CR of the pit and swarm you choose to 
determine the EL.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Kissing Maiden Trap:</b> CR 2; mechanical; location 
trigger; manual reset; Atk +12 (3d6 bludgeoning); unavoidable bull rush 
attempt by Medium creature with 18 Strength; Search DC 22; Disable 
Device DC 19.</p>
<p align="left">When a PC steps on a hidden pressure plate, a portion of
 the floor slides away and a post pivots up from the floor to slam into 
the character (think of stepping on a rake). They're called kissing 
maidens because many of the posts are covered in an iron sculpture of a 
woman. Smaller versions set at about waist height for a human often have
 metal heads cast to look like rams' heads.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Leghold Trap:</b> The leghold trap is similar to the 
animal traps used by hunters but sized for a human. Use the rules for 
the hobbling trap presented in <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide II.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Mobile Pit:</b> A mobile pit works like any other pit trap, but it's more like a <i>portable hole,</i>
 and a victim of the trap falls into in an extradimensional space. The 
pit then moves through the dungeon, whisking a trapped creature to a 
predetermined location. Although unintelligent, mobile pits might even 
travel a regular route like a patrolling creature. Mobile pits can move 
at different speeds, but most travel at a regular speed of 30 feet per 
round.</p>
<p align="left">Simply apply the mobile quality to any pit trap. You 
should increase the CR of a mobile pit by at least 1 and maybe by 2 or 
more depending on how fast it moves and toward what dangers it carries a
 victim.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pit with Bladed Chute Trap:</b> CR 3; mechanical; 
location trigger; manual reset; DC 20 Reflex save avoids; 30 ft. deep 
(3d6 slashing, 3d6 fall); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20.</p>
<p align="left">This narrow pit has blades in the wall that cut a victim as he falls and that make climbing out of the pit perilous.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Punishment Pit Trap:</b> Those who fall in a 
punishment pit are attacked by mechanical arms in the bottom of the pit.
 To make a punishment pit, simply put the CR 5 moving executioner statue
 trap from the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> at the bottom of whatever pit trap you use. Combine the CRs according to Table 3-1 in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide </i>to figure out the final EL.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Reverse Gravity Pit Trap:</b> Those who fall in a 
reverse gravity pit strike the bottom only to be flung to the ceiling 
and dropped to the bottom again. Combine whatever pit trap you like with
 the reverse gravity Trap from the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide.</i>
 Figure out the final average damage from the multiple falls and 
increase the CR of the lowest-CR trap by 1 per every 7 points higher the
 average damage is than the combined average damages of both traps. Once
 you do that, combine the CRs according to Table 3-1 in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide </i>to figure out the final EL.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Snare Trap:</b> CR 1; mechanical; location trigger; 
manual reset; DC 25 Reflex save avoids; creature pulled up to ceiling 
suddenly and held there until it makes a DC 15 Escape Artist check or 
until the cord holding the PC suffers 3 points of slashing damage (the 
metal cord has hardness 8).</p>
<p align="left">A snare trap works like an animal snare. A PC caught in the trap is hauled upward by his foot to the ceiling.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stone Restraints Trap:</b> CR 2; magic device; location trigger; no reset; spell effect (<i>stony grasp</i>,
 7th-level wizard, +11 grapple check against victim, attempts to grapple
 and pin for 14 rounds, grappling arm has AC 18, hardness 8, and 28 hit 
points); Search DC 28; Disable Device DC 28.</p>
<p align="left">The stone restraints trap (or <i>stony grasp</i> trap) causes the walls or floor to grow an arm and grab its victim. It's effectively a <i>stony grasp</i> trap. See <i>Complete Arcane</i> for a description of the <i>stony grasp </i>spell. To affect multiple creatures, place multiple traps in the area.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Puzzle Traps</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2008-10%20-%20Return%20to%20Undermountain%20-%20Traps_files/fr20050810b_sphinx.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="220" width="257">This
 article deals with typical dungeon traps; puzzle traps are a horse of a
 different color. Puzzle traps are usually obvious and often guard some 
location or object in an adventure. They're called "puzzle" traps 
because the PCs often have to figure out the puzzle of how to dismantle,
 disarm, or circumvent them.</p>
<p align="left">Puzzle traps can make great encounters on their own, but
 unless you put a fair amount of thought behind one, it easily can turn 
into a game-pausing or game-stopping trap. With a puzzle trap, you need 
to make sure that every PC can contribute to the solution.</p>
<p align="left">It's often best if the "puzzle" isn't a riddle or a 
logic game that the players must figure out. A riddle or logic puzzle 
might work if everyone in your group likes such things, but it's likely 
that either one person will swiftly figure it out or the whole group 
will be stymied.</p>
<p align="left">Instead, consider a puzzle that relies on the 
characters' abilities. For example: Perhaps the cleric and fighter have 
to push something heavy while the wizard levitates the rogue to an 
otherwise inaccessible lock.</p>

running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about
