<p align="left">Inside, over piping-hot food and delicious drinks, the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">PCs</a>. can hear a little about the village and about the ruins to the east.</p>
<p align="left">Not far east of this village sits the site of the old 
village. That village was built centuries ago, or so the stories go. It 
lasted for quite a while. No one is sure how long, but local legend 
agrees that a war was fought in the area and that the fighting led to 
the destruction of the old village. All that remained was the village 
square and a few buildings that surrounded it. These buildings were in 
surprisingly good shape given the destruction wrought around them.</p>
<p align="left">Decades or centuries later, the village, which had been 
moved away from the exact older village site for unknown reasons, 
started encompassing the ruins of the old one. The old buildings were 
torn down one fair day, leaving the square open to the winds, and the 
villagers planned the construction of new structures. </p>
<p align="left">The night after they had torn down these older 
structures, however, people reported hearing voices in the old square 
and seeing the old buildings sitting intact. In the morning, the ruined 
buildings were standing where they had been, and all signs of the new 
construction were gone. This went on for weeks, without explanation. 
Clerics, scholars, and sages came and examined everything. They reported
 hearing the voices, but saw no one. And they saw the old buildings fade
 into ghostly, and then material, existence. The people became too 
spooked to live near the old ruins, and they moved the whole village to 
its present spot. But some say that at night you can still hear voices 
in the old village square. Also, a few of the more superstitious 
villagers have reported seeing ghostly forms in the square.</p>
<p align="left">Further, three people from the village have gone to the 
old ruins at night and have not returned. Two were the children of the 
blacksmith, and one was the ranger son of a local farmer. Though the 
villagers made careful searches of the entire area on the days following
 the disappearances, the missing people were never found. Because the 
searchers discovered no traces at all of the missing people, everyone 
has a pet theory about what happened. For instance, some suspect the 
children have simply run away, while others believe some evil force 
snatched the two. Similar theories abound about the missing ranger.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Ruins</b></p>
<p align="left">If the adventurers decide to check out the square, you 
can use the following description, broken up or paraphrased as necessary
 as the PCs explore.</p>
<p align="left">The square itself is about 50 feet across, with an old 
dry fountain in the center. The fountain, which is about 10 feet across,
 has the remains of a statue of a human female in the center, and one 
small arch flows gracefully from the top of her pedestal to the rim of 
the fountain. The stone from the other arch lies scattered in the 
fountain basin. A large open expanse surrounds the fountain, and, at the
 north end, timbers that once supported a platform of some kind sink 
into the ground. The timbers are broken off at ground level, so they are
 not easy to see (Spot <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 17). Four broken stone benches stand around the fountain, but they are hardly usable now.</p>
<p align="left">Walls of ruined buildings surround the square, and 
rubble remains of those walls that fell over. The stone walls that still
 stand once supported structures that are missing now, but one can see 
where the remaining walls would have been, and thus how large each 
structure was. By examining the remnants of the structures, you can see 
that five streets of varying widths came into the square.</p>
<p align="left">DMs may want to ask for DC 15 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">Search checks</a>
 (and allow dwarves to use stonecunning) to notice that while the ruins 
are indeed ruins, the destroyed stonework doesn't look weathered -- the 
destruction looks fresh.</p>
<p align="left">During the day, nothing interesting happens here. The 
ruined walls can be torn down, the fountain destroyed, or the earth 
plowed up. However, anyone here at night sees a very strange sight. As 
the sun disappears below the horizon, a ghostly image of the ruins 
begins to appear. This image is not visible if the ruins are intact, but
 the image appears over any changes that have been made to the area. For
 example, if one of the walls is torn down, a ghostly wall appears in 
its place. If a tent is placed where the old wall was, the ghostly image
 forms in the tent.</p>
<p align="left">As the night progresses, bodiless voices drift in the 
square. They are indistinct but sound like a large number of people 
talking in normal voices, with all the voices overlaid. Sometimes one 
even sees flickering ghostly forms moving around in the clearing, but 
these glimpses are brief. As the night progresses, the ghostly images of
 the ruins become more solid, and any changes or additions become more 
ghostly. By dawn, the ruins return to their original state and any 
modifications disappear. Objects in the same space as the returning 
ruins disappear. Any objects sitting in open space in the ruins remain 
where they are.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Story Behind the Ruins</b></p>
<p align="left">Dungeon Masters have a few choices regarding the story 
behind the odd happenings in this area. For those who want an 
opportunity to deal with time travel and have a few ideas regarding 
options for getting characters back to their home time (if that is 
desired), read A Twist in Time. Otherwise, DMs can use the option called
 A Malfunctioning <i>Portal</i>?</p>
<p align="left"><b>A Twist in Time</b></p>
<p align="left">The secret to the strange stories in this area 
originates during the time the ruins were first created. As local rumor 
suggests, a battle raged in the area, but most of it happened a few 
miles away. However, a spillover skirmish between powerful mages moved 
through this area. The resultant release of magic destroyed the village 
and caused an unexplained rift in time that connected the past to the 
present. The particular past is 591 DR, just after the time of the 
destruction of the village, and the people are assessing the damage and 
what to do next. If the voices could be made distinct, that is what a 
listener would hear: people discussing the battle and the devastation 
and what to do next. The strange magic opens the connection every night,
 bringing the ruins (but not living creatures) forward to the present, 
where they replace anything that is "in their way."</p>
<p align="left">None of this explains what happened to the three people that are missing from the village, though. They were victims of a <i>portal</i>-like
 effect centered on the fountain. If one stands in the fountain at 
midnight on certain nights (perhaps during a certain moon phase that 
matches the one that existed at the time of the destruction of the 
village), one is transported back to the time of the voices and the 
overlap period. The creatures and any possessions they carry appear in 
the fountain in the distant past. The fountain is working at that time 
period (one of the few things to survive the destruction), so a bath is 
the first surprise that any travelers get. When they arrive, they see a 
few people still out talking, and these people view the newcomers with 
suspicion due to the magic used in the battle that destroyed their town.
 The villagers of the past are otherwise friendly or neutral in 
disposition. </p>
<p align="left">The second big surprise is that getting back is very difficult. This is not a <i>portal</i>
 in the normal sense, and so the return trip must be done by exchange. 
Specifically, if someone from that fateful day is standing in the 
fountain at midnight, and if someone is standing in the fountain in the 
present at midnight during the appropriate phase of the moon, the two 
are exchanged in time. Other than figuring out this exchange, one would 
have to find a powerful wizard who could develop magic to breach time (a
 nearly impossible task), or exist long enough to catch up with one's 
former life.</p>
<p align="left"><b>A Malfunctioning <i>Portal</i>?</b></p>
<p align="left">Back in the past (591 DR), an eccentric wizard created a clever (and rather small) <i>portal</i>
 framed by the fountain's arching structure as a means to get around a 
bit faster. She had a tower being built nearby, and she didn't mind 
getting her feet wet for the time being. However, when the battle raged,
 the wizard was called to fight, and she died while defending the area 
against another very powerful magic-user. The release of magic between 
the two dying spellcasters destroyed the village and affected the <i>portal</i> oddly -- it now acts as a malfunctioning <i>portal</i> (see page 61 in the <i>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting</i>).</p>
<p align="left">In addition to the now-faulty <i>portal</i>, other 
strange things started happening. People in the present who enter the 
area at the right time can hear the voices, which are actually people 
talking just after the time of the destruction of the village when the 
inhabitants are assessing the damage and figuring out what to do next. 
If the voices could be made distinct, that is what a listener would 
hear: people discussing the battle and the devastation and what to do 
next. The strange magic opens the connection every night, bringing the 
ruins (but not living creatures) forward to the present, where they 
replace anything that is "in their way."</p>
<p align="left">None of this explains what happened to the three people that are missing from the village, though. They were victims of a <i>portal</i>-like
 effect centered on the fountain. If one stands in the fountain at 
midnight on certain nights (perhaps during a certain moon phase that 
matches the one that existed at the time of the destruction of the 
village), the malfunctioning <i>portal</i> affects those standing within 5 feet of the intact arch. When the <i>portal</i>
 has a normal result, creatures and any possessions they carry appear at
 the destination point (which the DM can choose so as to tailor the 
locale to her campaign). Otherwise, use Table 2-2 on page 61 of the <i>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting</i>. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sole Inhabitant</b></p>
<p align="left">The three people who were lost from the village died (either due to the passing of time or unlucky mishaps with the <i>portal</i>),
 but only the farmer's son became a ghost and started haunting the 
ruins. This ghost is the form that one occasionally glimpses in the 
square, and he is restlessly trying to find a way home. He may choose to
 interact with the PCs if they stay in the ruins area for at least 2 
hours. His name is Fronn, and he came to realize how he was transported 
via the fountain; though he died, his spirit remained behind at the site
 of the <i>portal</i>. Because of this, he tries to keep other people out of the fountain during the times that the <i>portal</i>
 is active. The villagers have not encountered him because none of them 
come here at night anymore, nor do they stay very long even when they 
come during the day. Fronn materializes only near midnight, and only if 
creatures are in the ruins. Since his method of keeping people out of 
the fountain involves scaring them, he is likely to be perceived as an 
enemy at first. He defends himself if attacked, but he'd rather return 
to the Ethereal Plane than hurt someone.</p>
<p align="left">Note: If the time option is chosen, Fronn could have 
started out as a farmer and gained his skills over time in the past. If 
he dies due to a <i>portal</i> malfunction, then he walked into the 
effect as a 9th-level ranger. Some tweaking of his personal history 
(including some back story as to why he became a ranger) may add some 
interest to the setting.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Manifestation (Su):</b> Fronn's ghost dwells on the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_EtherealPlane')">Ethereal Plane</a>,
 and as an ethereal creature, he cannot affect or be affected by 
anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, he partly enters
 the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal there. A 
manifested ghost can strike with his touch attack, a ghost touch weapon,
 or a manifested weapon. A manifested ghost also remains partially on 
the Ethereal Plane, where he is not incorporeal. He can be attacked by 
opponents on either the Material or Ethereal Plane. Fronn's 
incorporeality helps protect him from foes on the Material Plane, but 
not from foes on the Ethereal Plane. When manifested, the ghost can be 
harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, 
spells, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spelllikeability')">spell-like abilities</a>, or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_supernatural%20ability')">supernatural abilities</a>.
 He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms and has a 50% chance to 
ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects, 
such as magic missiles, and attacks made with ghost touch weapons). When
 manifested, he can pass through solid objects (but not force effects) 
at will. His attacks ignore <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalarmorbonus')">natural armor</a>, armor, and shields, though <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_deflectionbonus')">deflection bonuses</a> and force effects work normally. He always moves silently (cannot be heard with Listen checks unless desired).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion:</b> Fronn may have one or more animal companions, but he has none at this time. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If exposed to any effect that 
normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, Fronn takes no damage with a successful saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Favored Enemy (Ex):</b> Fronn gains a +4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a>
 on his Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when 
using these skills against giants. He gains the same bonus on weapon 
damage.</p>
<p align="left">Against elves, he gains a +2 bonus on these skill checks and on weapon damage rolls.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Incorporeal Subtype:</b> Fronn can be harmed only by 
other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, spells, 
spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities; immune to all 
nonmagical attack forms; 50% chance to ignore any damage from a 
corporeal source (except for force effects, such as <i>magic missiles,</i>
 and attacks made with ghost touch weapons); can pass through solid 
objects (but not force effects) at will; attacks ignore natural armor, 
armor, and shields (though deflection bonuses and force effects work 
normally); moves silently (cannot be heard with Listen checks unless 
desired).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rejuvenation (Su):</b> Fronn's ghost that would 
otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts in 2d4 days with a 
successful level check (1d20 + 9) against DC 16. To prevent him from 
rejuvenating, Fronn's physical remains must be found and buried in the 
village's cemetery. (If the DM chooses to make the <i>portal</i> a 
malfunctioning one, she is encouraged to pick out a likely spot that may
 have caused Fronn's quick death; keep in mind that he is a 9th-level 
ranger at the time of the <i>portal</i> malfunction if the time option is not chosen.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swift Tracker (Ex):</b> Fronn can move at his normal 
speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He 
takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the usual -20) when moving at up to
 twice normal speed while tracking.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Turn Resistance (Ex): </b>Fronn is treated as a 13-HD undead for the purpose of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_turnundead')">turn</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rebukeundead')">rebuke</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_commandundead')">command</a>, or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bolsterundead')">bolster</a> attempts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> Fronn is immune to mind-affecting effects, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_poison')">poison</a>, sleep effects, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_paralysis')">paralysis</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_stunned')">stunning</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_disease')">disease</a>,
 death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it 
also works on objects or is harmless. He is not subject to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_criticalhit')">critical hits</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonlethaldamage')">nonlethal damage</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydamage')">ability damage</a> to his physical ability scores, ability drain, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_energydrain')">energy drain</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fatigued')">fatigue</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_exhausted')">exhaustion</a>, or death from <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_massivedamage')">massive damage</a>. He cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if he is willing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Woodland Stride:</b> Fronn may move through natural 
thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his normal speed
 without suffering damage or other impairment. However, thorns, briars, 
and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to 
impede motion still affect him.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Corrupting Gaze (Su):</b> Fronn can blast living 
beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30 feet. Creatures that meet 
the ghost's gaze must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 17) or take 2d10 
points of damage and 1d4 points of permanent Charisma drain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Moan (Su):</b> Fronn can moan as a standard
 action. Every living creature within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a
 DC 17 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, 
necromantic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully
