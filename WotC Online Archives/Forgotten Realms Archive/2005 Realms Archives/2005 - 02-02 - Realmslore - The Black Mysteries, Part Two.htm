<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left"><i>First, take a look at thaebra and maeraede.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Thaebra:</b> Thaebra ("THAY-bruh") is a dark blue, 
sticky paste that glistens when smeared onto a surface, but soon dries 
and hardens. Despite its blue color, Thaebra doesn't leave a stain. To 
make it, one boils the roots of certain plants found in the Shaar and 
adjoining lands (a tall, broadleaf grass; a small bright yellow 
ground-flower; and a tumbleweed, though precisely which ones are 
closely-guarded secrets) together in the same cauldron, stirring 
constantly.</p>
<p align="left">Hardened thaebra is very like dried hummus or badly set 
plaster, and it can be scraped or rubbed off flexible surfaces such as 
cloth and flesh. Heat, flame, and impacts do nothing to ignite it -- you
 must drop maeraede oil on it (see Thaebra-Maeraede Firebirth 
Alchemical).</p>
<p align="left">Merchants sometimes sell thaebra as a cosmetic because 
if smeared on skin, left for the better part of a day, and then removed,
 it takes most dyes and stains with it. It can also bleach to white any 
known hair, of any hue, when washed in water that contains as much 
powdered thaebra as will fill a fairly small human palm. Thaebra usually
 costs 8 gp for a small, palm-sized pot (4 ounces). This price can 
double easily if both buyer and seller know of the combined combustible 
qualities of thaebra and maeraede (see maeraede), and the buyer reveals 
any urgency of need.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Maeraede:</b> Maeraede ("may-urr-AE-dd") oil, a 
brownish-orange, translucent, odorless distillate of the leaves of a 
swamp-weed found in the coastlands of the Inner Sea, is usually sold as a
 purgative. In most mammals even as little as four drops taken orally 
causes immediate and violent vomiting and diarrhea, accompanied by 
debilitating cramps that seldom last more than 3 rounds (DC 25 Fort save
 to avoid; failure means the creature is nauseated for 1d4 rounds). This
 unpleasantness always swiftly ends the effects of light drunkenness, 
and often entirely expels poisons, parasites, and food taints from a 
mammal. A dose of maeraede taken after the initial exposure to an 
injected poison or diseases grants the imbiber a +1 circumstance bonus 
against the secondary effect of the poison or disease. (This latter 
effect varies widely from individual to individual, or maeraede would 
cost much more.) Maeraede oil goes for 4 gp for a finger-sized vial 
containing about 1 ounce. This price can double easily if both buyer and
 seller know of the combined combustible qualities of thaebra and 
maeraede (see thaebra), and the buyer reveals any urgency of need.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Thaebra-Maeraede Firebirth Alchemical: </b>A mere 
sprinkling (three or more drops) of maeraede oil on thaebra causes a hot
 white flame to instantly arise. If the thaebra has been applied to wood
 or cloth, it sets such substances alight in 2 rounds (unless water or 
other oils are splashed on its flame during the 1st round, which 
extinguishes that patch of thaebra forever). A thaebra fire causes an 
intense sensation of heat but no actual damage during the 1st round, but
 1d4+2 points of damage per round thereafter when ignited in contact 
with flesh (or clothes directly worn by a creature), with the flames 
persisting for as many rounds as there is thaebra to feed them. A smear 
of thaebra that weighs a quarter pound is about as large as a modern 
hamburger patty and will burn for 2 rounds. Each additional quarter 
pound extends the burning time 1 round, but doesn't generate any more 
heat. For example a half pound of thaebra burns for a total of 3 rounds,
 dealing 2d4+4 points of damage.</p>
<p align="left"><i>The next most often seen firebirth alchemical pairing is ardrent and osbra.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Ardrent:</b> Ardrent ("AR-drent") is a purple-brown 
powder derived from ground-up "leap-bugs" (locustlike hopping insects 
all too common in lands around the Shining Sea) and is usually sold in 
1-pound"handsacks" for 1 cp. Nothing likes to eat it, and it resists 
molds and rotting.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Osbra:</b> Osbra ("OZ-brah") is the dried, powdered 
form of the bitter, swift-to-rot tuber known as the tlardra 
("Tuh-LAR-druh"). This mauve-skinned, "crooked sausage"-shaped shallow 
wild plant grows in lands south of the Lake of Steam. Humans consider it
 inedible but sometimes feed it to pigs and captive snakes, who seem to 
find it very nourishing. Tlardras rarely fetch more than 1 cp/lb., but 
osbra (which is sometimes used as a long-lasting, "fast" mauve dye in 
garment-making) is usually sold in carved wooden "slide-top" flat 
coffers that hold 4 ounces, for 1 sp/coffer.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ardrent-Osbra Firebirth Alchemical:</b> Since both 
ardrent and osbra are found in powdered form, peddlers easily hide them 
among the vials of spices they offer for sale. The two powders ignite 
only when mixed together (at least 1 ounce of ardrent, but only a 
between-the-fingers pinch of osbra is required) and the mixture is then 
moistened with the spittle of any mammal (human saliva is most commonly 
used).</p>
<p align="left">An ardrent mix smolders for 2 rounds (during which it 
gives off smoke, due to a reaction with the air around it and not actual
 combustion), and then flares up in the 3rd round. If water or cold is 
applied to the mix at any time during those 2 rounds (and the cold 
effect must be intense enough to deal at least 1 point of damage), the 
mix becomes inert and can never ignite. In the 3rd and 4th rounds, the 
mix deals living creatures in direct contact with it 2d4 points damage. 
Damage falls to 1d6 points in the 5th round, 1d4 in the 6th, and then 
ends. Except when in contact with warm, dry material that readily 
ignites, ardrent-mix fires rarely spread or persist, so such mixes can 
burn holes, run along seams, and the like.</p>
<p align="left">Many other, rarer alchemicals are known, but Order 
members and other clergy of Kossuth try to keep all details of them 
secret. Observations confirm that many of these are powders that can be 
thrown into existing fire sources (such as lit braziers in temples to 
the Firelord) to produce specific effects, most often fierce, 
short-lived jets of flames that gout in particular directions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Black Flame Symbols</b></p>
<p align="left">The Order of the Black Flame uses a few nonmagical 
designs as markers so that they can silently impart information. These 
symbols seldom change, but a ring of dots (some doubled or trebled) 
often surround them. These dots have meanings that <i>do</i> change -- 
and are widely suspected to tell Order members that the symbol they 
encircle is false, or has an additional or altered meaning.</p>
<p align="left">Black Flame symbols are usually drawn on doors, 
sometimes in cobrascale ink (12 gp per 1-ounce pot), which is invisible 
except when heated by a torch, whereupon it flares into coppery orange 
brightness, only to fade the moment the heat source is withdrawn. The 
true formula of cobrascale ink is a secret known only to certain 
families in the Thayan tharch of Priador (and, of course, their ruling 
zulkir) and may have nothing at all to do with cobra scales.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Specific symbols used by the Order of the Black 
Flame, and more about their Mysteries, follow in the next installment of
 this column.</i></p>
