<p align="left"><i>He was insane—absolutely insane. I can't imagine any 
other words to explain it. Why would any rational person unleash a 
plague on the innocent and unsuspecting? He was a rabid dog and had to 
be put down.</i></p>
<p align="right">Teseryne Truesilver<br> Daughter of Talanthe Truesilver<br> Year of Rogue Dragons</p>
<p align="left">The trouble began at the High Moon Market in Loudwater. I
 know, because I was there shopping for spiced oranges that had just 
arriver from Tethyr. The Order of the Jade Blade was there as well which
 was fortunate.</p>
<p align="left">Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed three orcs 
arriving at the marketplace. A few years ago this would have started a 
panic, but not long ago High Lord Kalahar Twohands issued the Decree of 
Reception. The decree allowed orcs into town as a way to minimize the 
impact of the gray migrations of the orcs out of the High Forest. These 
orcs were shrouded in cloaks and smelled pungent and sticky. They 
started begging from the townsfolk saying that they needed help and a 
shaman.</p>
<p align="left">One of the orcs started gagging, and the cloak fell from
 his shoulders. He was covered in large, seeping pustules. The gagging 
turned into vomiting almost pure blood. Everyone backed away as the 
pustules swelled and then erupted spraying puss and foul smelling fluids
 onto those nearby. I thought I was going to be sick right there when 
the orc literally exploded, flinging steaming, yellow ooze everywhere. 
The remains of the orc melted into the ground, leaving a mass of 
decaying ooze, hair and blood. It was the most disgusting thing I've 
ever seen.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade immediately stepped in and calmed the 
panic. While they did that, I ran to get Prior Athosar of the Houses of 
Morning. Athosar discovered that the orcs suffered from a variant of the
 slimy doom disease. The disease was extremely contagious and, even 
worse, was something for which we had no herbal cure. While Athosar 
could say prayers to cure disease, too many people were exposed to catch
 all of them. An epidemic was imminent.</p>
<p align="left">The adventurers of the Jade Blade stepped forward and 
offered to track down where the orcs came from. They began following the
 back trail of the orcs. Many townsfolk remembered seeing them come in 
through the eastern gate. Beyond the gate, the tracks headed upriver. 
The group of orcs was once much larger, and the Jade Blade kept passing 
exploded corpses as they traveled further away from Loudwater.</p>
<p align="left">On the outskirts of the Grey Highlands, the adventurers 
encountered more evidence of the disease. A half-dozen diseased orcs ran
 at them in a savage attack, whereupon they promptly exploded from the 
disease. By this point, I strongly suspect that all the members of the 
Jade Blade had the slimy doom.</p>
<p align="left">While they were still scrapping the ooze off their 
clothing, one of the Jade Blade adventurers noticed that they were being
 watched by an orc crouching among the brush some distance away. They 
cautiously approached the orc to learn who she was and what was 
happening with the orcs. Their efforts were successful, as the orcish 
druid had no wish to fight. Her name was Kah'Liik, and she had managed 
to avoid the disease thus far. She had kept her distance from the other 
orcs and insisted that the Jade Blade stay away as well.</p>
<p align="left">Through a conversation shouted back and forth, the 
freeswords learned from Kah'Liik that the disease was being spread by 
insect bites from a swarm of locusts. She was away from camp when the 
locusts came and so survived. The locusts all since died, but not before
 infecting the other orcs. The locusts came from a cave some distance to
 the north and she gave our heroes directions.</p>
<p align="left">The cave turned out to be a twisted burrow of passages, 
probably created by umber hulks. They found the remains of thousands of 
dead locusts, whose shells coated the floor like a carpet that crunched 
under the adventurers’ feet. A hole in the ceiling led up to another set
 of caves, where the freeswords found Kranler Dhenta, held captive in a 
pit. Kranler was diseased and driven mad from torture. He raved that he 
was sent here to serve "the master," and that the master made him eat 
bugs. Our heroes pulled him from the pit and took him with them.</p>
<p align="left">The master awaited the Jade Blade in the next room. The 
master was Drahmin Stonesplinter, a druid insanely obsessed with 
diseases and vermin. He built a laboratory of sorts to refine his 
contagions, including the slimy doom that he had unleashed upon 
Loudwater. Our heroes slew him and destroyed his experiments, including 
the crate of writhing beetle larvae that were infected with the disease.
 In his laboratory notes, Drahmin detailed the process of how he created
 the virus and was infecting vermin and eventually the orcs.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade returned with the notes and Kranler to 
Loudwater, where healers restored his sanity. He was a member of the 
Zhentarim who got caught stealing from his superior and had been sent to
 Drahmin as punishment. Drahmin used him as a test subject for the 
diseases that he was creating. Kranler had some interesting things to 
say about how the Zhentarim were funding Drahmin's research. Krenler is 
still with us in Loudwater and loyally serves High Lord Kalahar.</p>
<p align="left">Athrosar and the town's healers pored over Drahmin's 
notes and found that they could make a cure but it required violet 
lotus, a rare herb that only grows in marshes along the Dragon Reach. 
The very next day, a Sweetwater Trader merchant caravan arrived from 
Orlbar carrying a large quantity of the violet lotus. They were willing 
to sell but only a premium. So Highlord Kalahar emptied the town's 
treasury buying the herb. The healers worked quickly and the epidemic 
was averted.</p>
<p align="left">It was incredibly lucky that the herb just happened to be passing through town. Don't you think?</p>
