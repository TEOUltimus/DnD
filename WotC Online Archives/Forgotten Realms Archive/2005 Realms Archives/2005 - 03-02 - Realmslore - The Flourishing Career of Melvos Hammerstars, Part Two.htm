<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left"><b>Hall and House</b></p>
<p align="left">The down owned by Melvos Hammerstars stands on the north
 side of a dirt lane called the Thelnwalk, about half-a-day's ride (when
 the lane is free of both snow and mud) east of its moot with the road 
joining Mulhessen and Saerb (a route known locally as "the Rattlebones 
Ride" because of its bumpy surface, caused by the well-buried logs that 
formed its original cross-all-bogs roadbed). The Thelnwalk runs east off
 the Mulhessen-Saerb road at about its halfway mark, near the 
not-on-most-maps wayhamlet of Olturret.</p>
<p align="left">The Hammerstars down is of middling size and consists of
 a shade-garden-with-many-tended-trees bower, a stables with a rear gate
 opening onto a wild forest crisscrossed with trails Hammerstars uses to
 take guests riding or to hunt boar and deer (and his servants use 
regularly to enrich their tables with snared rabbits and grouse taken 
with slung stones), and a house large enough to offer seven bedchamber 
suites, with a servants' wing and a large central hall for dining and 
dancing. In any Sembian city, a house of such size would be considered a
 mansion -- though its architecture would undoubtedly feature more 
haughty ornamentation.</p>
<p align="left">Melvos uses this country retreat for the same things 
most successful Sembian merchants do: entertaining trade partners (or 
merchants he's courting to become trade partners) with feasts and 
revelry (primarily drinking, hunting, and dallying with hired local 
"professional" companions; these three activities are often undertaken 
at once, the hunting of companions -- for amorous activities, not 
slaying and eating -- being known as "lacerunning"); relaxing (which 
usually really means hunting, drinking, plotting, and lots of sleeping);
 and various illicit or frowned-upon activities (such as trading or 
repackaging smuggled or stolen goods for resale, torturing or holding 
kidnapped-for-ransom trade rivals, and negotiations concerning unlawful 
goods or trade practices -- such as slavery involving kidnapped Sembian 
citizens, organized thieving within Sembia, and so on).</p>
<p align="left">It should be noted that Sembian law holds Sembians 
accountable for honoring trade agreements and contracts between Sembians
 anywhere in the Realms, but is entirely silent -- and even actively 
disinterested -- in the activities of Sembians outside the borders of 
Sembia (plus Sembian harbors and coastal waters). In other words, 
Sembians can openly trade in slaves, hire brigands and even private 
armies, and break all manner of laws outside Sembia, and Sembian courts 
and society care nothing about it -- unless or until such activities 
spread to harming other Sembians anywhere, or take place (even 
partially) inside Sembia.</p>
<p align="left">Imaginatively enough, Melvos calls his down Hammerstars Hall -- as opposed to Hammerstars House, his tallhouse in Saerloon.</p>
<p align="left">Most city-dwelling Sembians of the middle classes dwell 
in tallhouses, which are built in rows or terraces with their windowless
 side walls touching the side walls of neighboring tallhouses. Such 
structures are named for their tall (three to as many as six aboveground
 floors, the average being four), narrow (usually only 
one-room-and-a-passage wide) proportions. Most streets in Sembian cities
 are crowded with them.</p>
<p align="left">In the poorest areas, crumbling tallhouses are entirely 
given over to rental accommodations. Each room is usually let to a 
single person, who (if lacking a family) often subleases to up to six 
other roommates. Cooking-hearths are shared (or braziers are used on 
balconies also hosting clothes hung to dry), and sanitation consists of 
water buckets lugged from the harbor or common well-pumps, and 
"nightsoil" buckets casually dumped off the balcony into the street, or 
lowered to a passing nightsoil wagon.</p>
<p align="left">In better areas, tallhouses have cesspools and indoor 
jakes, and are rented out by the floor, usually to shopkeepers who both 
dwell and keep their shops in the uppermost cellar and at street level, 
and to families who dwell on the floors above. Sometimes tenants living 
on the upper floors run quiet businesses therefrom, such as scribe-work,
 <i>longtongue</i> work (what we would call either referral services or private investigators), <i>warmshoulders</i> services (what we might call hostess-offered prostitution), and <i>readykettle</i>
 establishments (offering one or two persons a hot meal, a ready bed 
without intimacy, and small-items storage with utter discretion -- which
 affords paying guests, particularly visitors with shady business 
connections, a place to run to and hole up for a day or two).</p>
<p align="left">As income and social levels increase, shops and 
upper-floor businesses grow fewer; more and more tallhouses are occupied
 entirely by their owner or a single renter, or are split between the 
owner and a single tenant. The wealthiest Sembians, of course, can 
afford mansions or even walled compounds within cities, but Melvos 
Hammerstars is far from being one of those.</p>

 the taxes and fees of Sembia, plus gain some tips on how Melvos and 
other typical merchants avoid them.</i></p>
