<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="LEFT">After warning patrons of the tavern that a snake will 
magically appear among them, Darvith Raldemarr calmly explains that 
before he takes the lid off the chalice, the questioner should ask their
 question -- only one query each night, per person -- of both himself 
and his daughter. It should concern a future decision as to an 
investment or deed that might or might not make the questioner 
wealthier, never something from the past or involving the honesty or 
performance of someone else. The questioner can cry it aloud for all to 
hear, or whisper it in both Raldemarr ears at once -- and each 
questioner can choose to have the Raldemarrs call out the reply or 
whisper it in confidence.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"The chalice will then be unhooded," Darvith adds, "and 
the Holy Serpent will bring the Reply of the God to one of us. The snake
 <i>will</i> be poisonous, but if not struck, menaced, or obstructed, 
and able to see both of the Anointed (humble father and daughter, 
standing before you) as we murmur the right prayers, all will be well."</p>
<p align="LEFT">"The Holy Serpent will travel to one of us, and we shall return it directly to the chalice. All shall be quite safe."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Many tavernmasters are familiar with the Raldemarrs and 
their holy cup -- and if they've heard of no great results from it, 
they've seldom seen harm from it, either. So long as a slithering snake 
doesn't panic patrons, spectacles are always welcome. And Darvith has 
none of the desperate air of a festival charlatan -- if no one seems 
moved to ask a question, he'll shrug, pray to the chalice, and order 
tankards for himself and his daughter. The chalice sits gleaming, 
however, until he departs -- and it's a rare alehouse crowd that doesn't
 have <i>someone</i> willing to part with a copper for a Holy Reply (even as a joke).</p>
<p align="LEFT">So it begins. The questioner is allowed to inspect the 
empty bowl before the lid goes down. The coin drops through the slot 
without any metallic clink, the Raldemarrs pray, one of them unhoods the
 chalice and sets the lid down right beside it, both of them kneel and 
bare their chests and murmur unintelligible prayers -- and a glittering,
 fanged snake rears up out of the bowl, opening its jaws wide to hiss!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then it glides down the chalice to the lid, circles it 
once, and slithers straight to one of the Raldemarrs, climbing them to 
rear back and viciously fang the offered human chest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Shuddering and gasping in obvious pain, the bitten 
Darvith or Taleene then tenderly cradles the Serpent, murmuring thanks 
to it and a prayer to the god. They then pass the snake to their 
unbitten partner for gentle return to the chalice (which is rehooded to 
await the next question, for the Serpent won't vanish again "until 
morning").</p>
<p align="LEFT">The bitten Anointed then delivers the Holy Reply to the 
questioner, sometimes with the blood drawn by the serpent's bite 
trickling down their front.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Impressive enough -- and a complete sham. Darvith and 
Taleene make enough from the coins it brings to pay for food, drink, 
caravan escort, and rooms, allowing them to sell their sundries only at 
good prices, and never out of desperation.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The domed lid of the chalice is hollow, with a shallow 
upper chamber filled with sticky sap that coins stick to (and so they 
don't rattle around when the lid is lifted; when one of the Raldemarrs 
heats the lid later, the sap becomes liquid and releases the coins). So 
offerings go in and "vanish."</p>
<p align="LEFT">A larger chamber below it in the lid (which has a richly
 engraved, flat inside bottom, not a concave one) has a collapsible 
floor (triggered by any two of the small, apparently ornamental studs 
around its edge; the graven lines of the design conceal its seams) that 
drops a snake hidden inside the chamber into the bowl of the chalice.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Raldemarrs "milk" the trained snake regularly of its
 poison, and the family also has immunity to its venom (as well as that 
of two other types of snakes). Both of them know much regional lore, 
lost and buried treasure tales in particular, and simply invent Holy 
Replies.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A Waterdhavian noble had the chalice constructed for 
him, and then he abandoned it upon learning its secrets were widely 
known in Scornubel (home of the long-dead smith who fashioned it). Much 
of its reputation is due to Darvith diligently spreading rumors about it
 for two decades now.</p>
<p align="LEFT">He began working this act with his wife, but she retired
 to Elturel to rear snakes when her health and looks started to fail, 
and Darvith's eldest daughter took her place.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>So ends the tale of the Chalice of Serpents.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The next installment of this column will commence a 
brief exploration of the Black Mysteries -- that is, particulars about 
the Order of the Black Flame that remain mysterious to all who don't 
happen to be Order members.</i></p>
