 pillar, tries to jump off a pillar, or takes damage while balancing on a

can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the board and hang beneath it to 
avoid hitting the water. See page 67 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more details.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Climb DC 15: </b>Climbing the side of a pillar is considerably easier than climbing a wall (which is DC 20).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jump DC Varies: </b>PCs can step to adjacent pillars,
 but other distances require a Jump check. A pillar edge is 1 foot 
inside its square, thus no jumping distance is less that 7 feet. 
Remember that standing jumps double the DC. See page 77 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information.</p>

look like rubble from the ceiling or like a pile of broken floor pieces.

<p align="LEFT">Several goblins call this section of Undermountain home.
 They've taken advantage of dungeon terrain to create a defensible 
resting area. A water-filled pit yawns below an area once occupied by 
slate floor. Within the pit stand several pillars while other broken 
pillars lurk beneath the water. The area might once have served as a 
natural cistern, or perhaps a pit trap once guarded the hall but has 
since been lost. In any event, the goblins guard their position 
fiercely.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PC aren't carrying any light sources, the goblins
 need to make Listen checks to learn of the PCs before they enter the 
range of the goblin's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_darkvision')">darkvision</a>
 (60 feet). Assuming the goblins know the PCs are coming, they hide 
behind the barricades they've made out of dungeon detritus and peek over
 the tops or through cracks. In such a case, make Hide checks for the 
goblins.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The goblins don't initiate an attack until a PC has 
jumped onto a pillar, gone into the water, or otherwise come close to 
them. Their goal is to stay behind cover and throw javelins at the PCs. 
They focus attacks on balancing or climbing PCs to make them fall in the
 water. They largely ignore swimming PCs unless the PC causes them 
damage or no more PCs are active and out of the water.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a goblin runs out of javelins (each carries 5), it 
retreats and allows another goblin to take its place. If they all run 
out of javelins or are taking too many casualties in the fight, they 
retreat to total cover and hope to make a stand in melee against the 
PCs. The goblins behind the walls wait to relieve a fallen comrade or to
 take their place as throwers when one runs out of javelins.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Should the PCs attempt to parlay, the goblins make a 
show of listening, even going so far as to offer a board for the PCs to 
cross. As soon as a PC is in a vulnerable position above the water, such
 as when crossing over a board, the goblins kick out the board and 
attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Pillars:</b> The pillars once held a floor above the 
water. Now that floor lies beneath the water, and the pillars remain 
standing. The goblins use wooden boards to cross the pillars, keeping 
unused boards in their sleeping area. The top of each pillar is rough 
and slippery, requiring Balance checks (see the Relevant Checks 
sidebar). Jumping from pillar to pillar might lead to a fall to the 
water 10 feet below. Adjacent pillars would be a 5-foot adjustment, but 
the need for keeping balance makes the 5-foot adjustment impossible. 
Thus, even a step to an adjacent pillar requires 10 feet of movement.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Break-Away Ledge:</b><i></i>CR 1/3; mechanical; touch trigger; no reset; unavoidable fall to the water; Search DC 15; Disable Device DC --.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A section of floor remains attached to the wall over the
 water. Having fallen prey to another such section already, the goblins 
know it to be unstable and avoid stepping on it. When a character puts 
weight on the floor section, it detaches from the wall and dumps the PC 
into the water.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Barricades: </b>The goblins have created barricades 
out of rubble, rotting boards, and other dungeon detritus. They stand 
roughly 2-1/2 feet tall and provide the goblins standing behind them 
with cover (+4 to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">AC</a>). Although made of strong materials, the barricades are poorly constructed. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Barricade:</b> 1 ft. thick; hardness 9; <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hp</a> 25; break DC 11.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Goblin Skirmisher (8):</b> Use the statistics for the Goblin Skirmisher (31/60) from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965800000">Harbinger</a></i>miniatures set<i>. </i>If you don't have that miniature, use the statistics from the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Water:</b> No dangers lurk in the water (unless you 
put them there), and the water is perfectly potable (if you don't mind 
the idea that a goblin might have fallen into it once or twice). The 
goblins keep the water clear of bodies and other refuse since it serves 
them as their source of fluids.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> An <i>elixir of sneaking</i> bobs in the water, left here by a past victim of the goblins. It floats cork up near one of the walls.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b></p>
<ul>
<li> Although technically an EL 3 encounter, you should consider using this encounter against lower-level PCs. A <i>wand of magic missile</i>
 can make short work of the goblins, forcing them to hide around the 
corner rather than throw javelins at jumping PCs, and a 3rd-level PC is 
likely to have better bonuses on the relevant skill checks. This 
encounter will be more fun for you and the players if there's more risk.
 However, 1st-level PCs might find this combat very difficult. If so, 
you can reduce the EL by diminishing the number of goblins and 
artificially reducing the Jump and Balance DC.<br><br> This encounter 
could be a goblin guard post protecting the rest of the tribe. The five 
rooms beyond this one are separated from the rest of the dungeon and 
make a great lair for the goblins or some other creature that uses the 
goblins as guardians.<br><br></li>
<li>You can increase the EL of the encounter by adding more goblins. Other cool goblin options include the Goblin Warrior (<i>Harbinger,</i> 32/60), Snig the Axe (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966250000">Archfiends</a>,</i> 8/60), the Silent Wolf Goblin (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966240000">Aberrations</a></i> 3/60), and the Goblin Adept (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966280000">Death Knell</a>,</i> 4/60).<br><br>
 You can also increase the encounter difficulty slightly by having some 
of the broken pillars lying a foot or two beneath the water's surface. 
Then a PC or goblin that falls into one of those squares takes 1d6 
points of damage.<br><br></li>
<li>You could change the encounter by making the area around the pillars
 be a dry pit or have it be filled by some other material such as 
diseased water or even acid.<br><br></li>
<li>Consider adding a monster to the water beneath the floor. Perhaps 
there's a sea cat in the water, which the goblins periodically feed but 
keep hungry. The monster might have gotten into the water through some 
now-closed link to the ocean, or perhaps Halaster put it there on a 
whim.<br><br></li>
<li>The watery area beneath the floor could lead to a heretofore undiscovered section of Undermountain -- even an entire sublevel.</li>

</p><p align="LEFT"><b>About the Author </b></p> Once Editor-in-Chief of <i>Dragon </i>magazine and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain.<p></p>
