<p align="left"><i>While it works best in the plains or foothills, this 
locale really can go anywhere in the Realms. It could be close to the 
known home of dragons, such as the Forest of Wyrms or the Lizard Marsh 
in the Western Heartlands, or the foothills of the Deepwing Mountains in
 the Vilhon Reach. It could also fit very well into the plains of the 
Shaar or the Shining Plains. Even far-flung Vaasa could host this unique
 site. However, secret dangers make this place dangerous for lower-level
 heroes. This locale is suitable for four 12th-level player characters.</i></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2003-23%20-%20Adventure%20Locales%20-%20The%20Dragon%27s%20Skeleton_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p align="left">The road winds through the wilderness toward a known 
local curiosity. Stories in the nearby villages tell of the giant 
dragon's skeleton and the ruins beneath it, and these same tales hint at
 dark secrets of magic and brutality associated with the site. Dark 
rituals to Tiamat are performed there, say some. Others speak of 
lizardfolk tribes that have lived there and raided the nearby villages 
in years past. And others speak of a foul half-dragon wizard that 
resides in the ruins, planning dark deeds against the villages. These 
stories, and the nature of the site itself, pull a great many people to 
come and see this wonder of the Realms, and at one time some even stayed
 to study the bones and the ruins. No one in the last few years has 
disappeared at the site, or even suffered any harm. Nowadays people see 
the strange sight and continue on their way; the sages have studied and 
gone, so the bones are left in peace at night.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Getting to the Skeleton</b></p>
<p align="left">Anyone in the region can describe how to reach the site,
 and some even hire themselves out as guides to the gullible. The road 
reaches a fork; to the left the road goes to the skeleton, and the right
 leads around it and on toward the next village. Trackers searching at 
the intersection see a great many tracks going toward the right road, 
though very few tracks go toward the left fork and the skeleton site.</p>
<p align="left">Taking the left fork, one walks about a mile around some
 trees and a rock pile, and comes upon a strange sight indeed. The 
skeleton of a dragon sits in the center of a clear area about 600 feet 
across.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Worn Remains</b></p>
<p align="left">Most of the dragon's bones still arch upright, piercing 
the air, with the massive head lying on the ground facing the traveler. 
Many of the features that once marked the face have worn away with time 
and weather, leaving only empty eye sockets, a long nose, a few teeth, 
and a pair of curved horns. The neck winds backward to the massive 
torso, which sits on the ground with the ribs embedded in the earth. The
 space underneath the torso is over 100 feet across and 150 feet long, 
which some say makes it the most massive dragon ever to live on Toril. 
The remains of a tail stretch away across the plain; what remains 
clearly indicates that the tail was probably 150 feet long as well. 
Nothing remains of the wings or legs, though shattered bone fragments 
litter the entire area and have worked into the soil.</p>
<p align="left">Within the torso, one sees the ruins of at least 12 
buildings and a main square of some kind. The buildings look to be about
 120 years old, and though they appear to be decaying with time, they 
are in decent shape. Most still have roofs, and the stone walls look to 
be laced with bones. Excavation would show that at least three towns 
have been built on this spot, and abandoned, since the great creature 
fell to the earth. Even the remains of a fortification wall surround the
 skeletal ribs (very minimal, but one can tell a wall stood there once).
 The ruins have been picked clean, and they now serve as only a 
curiosity.</p>
<p align="left">No one knows how long this dragon has been here, or what
 killed it, or even what kind of dragon it is. Some sages (of a 
religious bent) theorize that the remains belong to some dead god, while
 others think that it might have come to this world through a <i>portal</i> and then found itself unable to sustain its life here. No <i>portal</i>
 to another world exists nearby, so those sages are hard-pressed to fill
 in the gaps of their theory, but one bright fellow suggested that the <i>portal</i>
 was destroyed in some magic cataclysm ages ago. The rural folk who have
 lived nearby for generations don't presume to theorize anything; the 
creature is dead, so they don't have time for worrying about where it 
came from. All they care about is that the peace that usually marks the 
area remains intact, and, until recently, that was its most notable 
feature -- though the nearby neighbors haven't yet discovered that this 
has changed. No longer are the ruins the safe curiosity that they once 
were.</p>
<p align="left"><b>New Residents</b></p>
<p align="left">Just a couple of days ago, new occupants arrived at the 
ruin site. Kaflaa, a half-dragon (deep) half-troglodyte and his band of 
gifted troglodytes found themselves forced out of their Underdark home a
 month or so ago, and they have been looking for a new place from which 
to exact revenge and gain power. The ruins seemed perfect to Kaflaa, who
 has draconic heritage of his own. He and his minions moved into the 
lower levels of the ruined buildings, and they have cleared enough room 
for themselves. They now occupy two former cellars of adjacent buildings
 in the ruined city; these cellars were built before the current ruins 
existed, which means they are effectively two levels down. From a cellar
 dating to the current ruins, a secret trapdoor leads down to their new 
base. Further, they have dug themselves an escape tunnel that goes 
westward and emerges in a clump of thick brush about 50 feet away from 
the skeleton.</p>
<p align="left">Kaflaa and his minions come out only at night, and they 
spend the nights scouting the nearby territory. Since hardly anyone 
ventures out at night alone in this rural community, they have learned a
 lot without being discovered. They know the populations and locations 
of the surrounding communities, as well as what resources the 
communities are likely to have. They steal cattle to eat, but have only 
done so once and the owner has not even noticed that the cow is missing 
yet (since he has several hundred head and pays little attention to 
them). If encountered, the troglodytes would likely try to regroup and 
handle any adversaries together. They especially want Kaflaa, their 
powerful leader, to be present for any battle.</p>
<p align="left">During the days, one or another of the troglodytes 
watches the ruins and what visitors do there. So far no one has 
approached where they are hiding, and the band is ready to dispatch 
anyone who does. Troglodyte stench would be an obvious giveaway even if 
no troglodytes are seen. They attack if they feel they will be 
discovered. In this case, they come at intruders from the cellar and 
from the secret escape tunnel, hoping to pin them down.</p>
<p align="left">Kaflaa plans to remain in hiding for another month and 
build his supplies, and then begin to strike at caravans and farmers to 
spread terror. Eventually he plans to assume control of the region and 
attract more of his race to his banner. If his plans succeed, he will 
lead his army against the hated duergar and drow that drove him from the
 Underdark.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion Benefits:</b> Each ranger gains the following benefits from his companion. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Link (Ex):</i> The ranger can handle the viper as a 
free action or push it as a move action. He gains a +4 bonus on all wild

<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i> The ranger may have any spell 
he casts upon himself also affect the viper if desired. The viper must 
be within 5 feet of him at the time of casting to receive this benefit. 
If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting
 the viper if he moves more than 5 feet away and does not affect him 
again even if he returns before the duration expires. The ranger may 
also cast a spell with a target of "You" on the viper (as a touch range 
spell) instead of on himself. The two can even share spells that do not 
normally affect creatures of the animal type.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Favored Enemy (Ex):</b> Each ranger gains a +4 bonus 
on his Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using
