<p align="left"><b>Listen DC 14: </b>This result allows the PCs to hear 
the distant murmur of the Yawning Portal's taproom above the shaft. If a
 PC beats the DC by 10 or more, she can discern what someone is saying, 
likely getting scraps of different conversations about their chance of 
success and whatever other business or entertainment the individual 
patrons are focused on. If someone whispers up above, the DC increases 
by an additional +15.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (Geography) DC 10: </b>One of the stones in
 the wall bears an uncanny resemblance to the shape of Cormyr's borders.
 This is important only if the PCs discover the words scratched on the 
back of the shield (see below).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Search DC 10: </b>One of the shields has the words, 
"Crevice by the stone shaped like Cormyr" scratched into its back with a
 knife. It was left as a hint to the whereabouts of the gold coin left 
lodged in the crevice by someone hoping to use it to pay Durnan for the 
trip up. Having the hint provides a +10 bonus on a Search check to find 
the coin. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Search DC 25: </b>A well-hidden secret door lies in the north wall. It can't be opened on this side except by magic or force.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Search DC 25:</b> A Search check result this high 
discovers 1 gp lodged in the wall behind one of the shields. It was left
 by a dungeon delver to pay for his return journey up the well. 
Unfortunately, he never returned to claim it, as the 40-year-old minting
 on the coin attests.</p>

<p align="left">Several inches of sand covers the floor of this roughly 
square room. Broken and dented shields hang on stone walls covered with 
chalk and charcoal graffiti. The ceiling looms a mere 10 feet above you

but a 30-foot-diameter hole in the ceiling forms a chimney that rises up
 over a hundred feet.</p>

<p align="left">This is the bottom of the well, and the hole above leads to the Yawning Portal (described in Return to Undermountain: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ru/20050309a">An Introduction</a>).
 The shields decorating the walls are worthless, although some bear the 
mark of noble houses and dwarf clans. The writing on the walls consists 
of dire warnings, snippets of popular songs and poetry, and the crude 
commentary common to graffiti everywhere. It's written in Common, Elven,
 Dwarven, Halfling, Gnome, Orc, and Goblin. (DMs should feel free to add
 regional languages to suit her campaign.) Many people have written in 
Common that "'So-and-so' was here." These were often left as proof of 
fulfillment of a bet or a dare to spend a night in Undermountain.</p>
<p align="left">The writing could say almost anything you like. Here are a few of the more memorable inscriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Durnan is a bastard. I swear by Gruumsh that when I get out of here
 I'll stuff his throat with gold pieces until he chokes. -- Slurg" 
(written in Orc)<br></li>
<li>"Hesod -- Went to check out a strange music only Jayce can hear. Have a few drinks until we get back." (written in Common)</li>
<li> "It's been two days. Leave a message if you have returned. -- Hesod" (written in Common) </li>
<li> "It's been two weeks. I can wait no longer. I seek you out myself. 
None of our 'friends' would come with me. If you are not with me when 
you read this, then I am dead. Avenge my death on those who abandoned us
 in our time of need. -- Hesod" (written in Common)</li>
<li> "Many swords come here. Do not stay." (written in Goblin)</li>
<li> "Here there lies a secret door,<br> but you will not find it or,<br> you won't be able to open it,<br> and then you'll rot here in this pit.<br> Ha ha." (written in Common on the secret door)</li>
<li> "Beware the she-wolf and her night hounds. They killed Sarth." (written in Common)</li>
<li>"You came here unbidden, now you'll die in this midden." (written in Common)</li>
<li>"Tymora, remember me." (written in Common)</li>
<li>"Durembar Ironshanks was here and killed more orcs than he could 
count." (written in Dwarven) "That means eleven." (written in Elven)</li>
<li>"Beware the eastern passages. The Metal Mage has made them his home, and he is not to be trifled with." (written in Common)</li>
<li>"When you hear screaming, go the other way." (written in Halfling) "Coward!" (written in Halfling in another hand)</li>
<li>"Sorci Laughmantle died somewhere in that maze. She wears a 
heart-shaped brass ring. If you find her, say a prayer over her bones. 
We didn't have time." (written in Gnome)</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Some inhabitants of Undermountain know that this room is a place 
where adventurers enter the dungeon. Most creatures avoid it for that 
reason, but a desperately hungry monster might wait just outside the 
room. <br><br></li>
<li> The sand in the room could disguise a deadly threat. <i>Libris Mortis: The Book of Undead</i>
 contains the swarm-shifter template, which allows an undead to take the
 form of a swarm. The sand swarm form might be particularly useful, 
allowing an undead to lie in wait in the sand of the floor. The template
 can be applied to any corporeal undead with an Intelligence score, and 
it adds +1 to the undead's CR. A ghoul might be appropriate for a 
low-level party, but <i>Libris Mortis</i> presents many other great options. <br><br></li>
<li> The writing on the walls might provide a hint about a trap or puzzle encountered later in the dungeon.<br><br></li>
<li>The writing on the walls might have something written by an old friend or foe the PCs didn't expect to see in Undermountain. </li>

<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
