<p align="left"><i>"Bane's power knows no borders." Or so his servants 
claim. It is a frightening thought. The Lord of Tyrants seeks to extend 
his dominion over the Delimbiyr Vale and the caverns below; and, as we 
found out, over both the living and the dead.</i></p>
<p align="right">Teseryne Truesilver<br> Daughter of Talanthe Truesilver<br> Year of Rogue Dragons</p>
<p align="left">The call came again in the middle of the night. Lisyil 
Sweetwhisper awoke the members of the Jade Blade to inform them that 
High Lord Kalahar Twohands wished to see them immediately. Quickly 
dressing, the adventurers hurried to the High Lord's Hall to find out 
what was so pressing.</p>
<p align="left">Kalahar received another dream from Mielikki. The Jade 
Blade's earlier experience in the Heart of Bane, in the Fortress of the 
Eternal Despot, caused another premonition from the Lady of the Forests.
 A great evil was hidden in that place, but the details from the dream 
were flitting away from Kalahar. </p>
<p align="left">Chancellor Vendross Thaddren had uncovered information 
about the Heart of Bane. The fane housed phylacteries of those who died 
fighting against the Dark God. Each black crystal had a soul trapped 
within it. As if this was not bad enough, Vendross's research revealed 
that a chamber beneath the Heart of Bane housed an evil artifact called 
the <i>Scepter of Eternal Dominion,</i> which holds power over souls who
 died in opposition to Bane. Vendross cautioned that a watery death 
waited any who sought to recover the scepter.</p>
<p align="left">Kalahar wanted this tool of the Banites removed for the 
safety of both Loudwater and all that was good in the Delimbiyr Vale, so
 he asked the Jade Blade to return to Orlbar and retrieve the scepter. 
He also wanted our heroes to avoid a watery death, so he gave the 
adventurers <i>potions of water breathing</i> to help them on their quest.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade journeyed back to Orlbar and the Fortress
 of the Eternal Despot. Once again, they opted to use the culvert to get
 inside the temple. But this time the Zhentarim had taken steps to 
prevent access, trapping it with a powerful spell. The adventurers were a
 trifle incautious and set off the trap, which summoned a pillar of 
flame down onto them, burning some of them badly.</p>
<p align="left">The rest of the crawl through the culvert was uneventful
 and they found themselves in the Heart of Bane shortly thereafter. No 
sooner had they stepped out onto the bone walkway when they were 
accosted by two priests of Bane—the Tyrants Venrik and Greaves. The bone
 walkways helped the priests by lifting them from one walkway to the 
next while ripping and tearing at the adventurers. The tyrants summoned 
fiendish monsters to aid them, then cloaked themselves in mist before 
joining the fight. The battle was confusing as the priests constantly 
moved about thanks to the walkways; but the Jade Blade eventually killed
 them.</p><img src="2005%20-%2008-17%20-%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Green%20Regent%20-%20Backstory%20-%20Tyranny_files/frgr20050817a1.jpg" alt="Sunken Temple of Bane." title="Sunken Temple of Bane." align="right" border="0" height="196" width="300"><p align="left">With
 the deaths of the two tyrants, the Jade Blade could explore the Heart 
of Bane at their leisure. They found a secret door that opened to a 
spiral stairway leading down to a vast cavern dominated by a lake. On 
the narrow shore they found a marker with the clenched fist symbol of 
Bane and words written in the tongue of fiends. It read "Bane's dominion
 knows no border".</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade drank their potions and dove into the 
lake. The murky water made it difficult to see, but at the very bottom 
they found a hole in the lakebed. Next to it was another marker with the
 symbol of Bane. It was written with the words "Hatred is the path to 
power. Tyranny is the way to rule." Regrettably, the marker was trapped 
and touching it unleashed another blast of infernal power on our heroes.</p>
<p align="left">The hole led to the Sunken Temple of Bane. It was 
flooded, dark, and deserted. The adventurers explored the water-filled 
passages, which were decorated with murals depicting worshipers of Bane 
as well as strange human-fish crossbreeds emerging from a portal to 
greet the worshipers. While they swam through the halls, they were 
attacked by a water elemental and by restless, mad spirits of tyrants of
 Bane who had become allips. In addition, they were attacked by a school
 of the human-fish crossbreeds that I have recently learned are called 
scum. They fought off all these threats and delved deeper into the 
temple.</p><img src="2005%20-%2008-17%20-%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Green%20Regent%20-%20Backstory%20-%20Tyranny_files/frgr20050817a2.jpg" alt="Aboleth in the Hall of Devotion.." title="Aboleth in the Hall of Devotion.." align="right" border="0" height="337" width="250"><p align="left">The <i>Scepter of Eternal Dominion</i>
 was hidden in the last and largest chamber of the Sunken Temple, called
 the Hall of Devotion. Floating in the water over the large stone altar 
that was obviously used for sacrifice was a primeval fish-like monster 
called an aboleth. The horrid thing reached out with its mind and seized
 control of two of the Jade Blade, forcing them to attack their 
companions. Our heroes reacted swiftly and countered the compulsion with
 a ward that protected the enslaved adventures from evil and prevented 
the aboleth from exerting control. With its most fearsome power 
neutralized, the aboleth did not last long against the vengeful blades 
of our heroes. </p>
<p align="left">With its last ounce of malice and strength, the aboleth 
knocked over the sole pillar that held the hall's roof up. Without the 
support, the Hall of Devotion started to collapse in on itself. As the 
pieces fell away, the adventurers noticed a hole in the roof that led up
 and out into the River Greyflow that flowed above them. The Jade Blade 
desperately searched for the scepter, which they found hidden beneath 
the altar. Their prize in hand, the Jade Blade swam out of the 
collapsing hall into the river and finally to the surface and fresh air.</p>
<p align="left">The Jade Blade made their way back to Loudwater where 
they turned the scepter over to High Lord Kalahar and Vendross Thaddren.
 Kalahar was quite pleased and instructed Vendross to secure the scepter
 so that it would not fall into Banite hands. The High Lord thanked the 
Jade Blade for their service and rewarded them handsomely.</p>
