<p align="left"><b>Taxes, Fees, and Avoiding Them</b></p>
<p align="left">In addition to business license fees, per-animal-stall 
stabling license fees, and "gate passage" or "docking" goods taxes, most
 Sembian cities collect an annual "head tax" from residents regardless 
of whether or not they provide any desired services in return for it.</p>
<p align="left">Such taxes typically range from 1 sp for the rent of a 
single tallhouse room or ownership of the tiniest of hovels, up through 1
 gp for the tenant of a tallhouse floor, to 3 to 5 gp levied against the
 owner of a tallhouse. Taxes for mansions of any sort start at more than
 triple these amounts (18 gp annually is about the cheapest such tax 
levied; most are 25 gp and up for a grand house, and 45 gp or more for 
anything with extensive grounds and outbuildings).</p>
<p align="left">So although Melvos Hammerstars could certainly afford a 
large mansion, he neither wants to advertise his success so boldly (to 
thieves and trade cabals who might want to "squeeze" or "pluck" him, by 
acting in concert against his mercantile activities until losses force 
him to sell things to them) nor to pay such "ruinous" taxes. So he keeps
 to his tallhouse, and lives quietly -- but very actively -- therein, 
visiting his down in the countryside every tenday or so, for up to six 
nights at a time, in the warmest four months only (unless diseases, 
unrest in the city, or the hostility of personal trade rivals makes 
longer absences advisable).</p>
<p align="left">Hammerstars House stands on the east side of Sundultarm 
Street, in one of the better darths in northwestern Saerloon -- a 
neighborhood known as Windhowl. This neighborhood gets its name due to 
the noises created when anything stronger than a breeze blows through 
the many spires, rooftop statues, and ornamentations of its tallest and 
grandest structures.</p>
<p align="left">Sembia charges fees for land deed transfers, registering
 ships, and for nigh on a hundred other little things, but there's no 
general income tax, or anything levied on private business transactions.
 Like most Sembians, Melvos Hammerstars is aware of all applicable taxes
 and details of the regulations regarding their enforcement, and he 
adroitly arranges his affairs to escape most of them. A good way to 
instantly enrage a Sembian is to try to expand interpretations of when a
 particular tax applies or becomes payable.</p>
<p align="left">Profits are highest, of course, on goods imported or 
exported without paying gate passage or docking fees (particularly for 
the sorts of goods, such as weaponry or magic, for which the highest 
fees are levied). Almost every Sembian old enough to walk and talk has 
been guilty of avoiding handing over some coins by under-reporting 
amounts of goods (paying the rightful fee for two hundred and forty-two 
pots but actually shipping two hundred and forty-eight), but fewer risk 
false claims (covering weapons with a deep layer of pots and claiming 
the entire wagon or ship hold is full of pots) or omit reporting entire 
vessels. This probably isn't due to any lack of boldness or surfeit of 
honesty, but merely to the fact that fewer Sembians own or can afford to
 rent more than one merchant ship, or move enough pots (or weapons) to 
make the boldest deceptions worthwhile.</p>
<p align="left">Most Sembians, Melvos Hammerstars very much among them, 
have no interest at all in paying the government more than the 
unavoidable minimum of fees and taxes, and they operate in a mercantile 
environment where privacy about one's own affairs (except when boasting 
about triumphs and chortling over pratfalls seasons after they become 
mere history) is both good practice and everyday habit.</p>
<p align="left">Most "good traders" (the Sembian term for anyone with a 
head for business, which is at least nine out of every ten Sembians) 
have quite a few secrets they're anxious to keep hidden from the 
authorities, trade rivals, neighbors looking to make a few silver by 
selling information about what they've seen and heard, and family 
members.</p>
<p align="left">In this respect, Melvos Hammerstars is very much a good 
trader. He doesn't bother to conceal his wine-blending business (of 
rough Dales vintages, into kegs for export around many Inner Sea ports 
as cheap but refreshing "throatslake") or his sideline tile-roof-fixing 
business in Saerloon, his investment in the cobbler's shop run by the 
son of a friend (Olanthiir's Fine Feet, on Scorneel Street), or his part
 ownership, via a <i>coinring</i> of nine investors (we might say <i>syndicate</i> or <i>holding company</i>) called the Sundul Full Palm, of two rental tallhouses on Pranthar's Street.</p>
<p align="left">However, he keeps very quiet about his other interests 
-- the "few little forgotten things" that bring in five-sixths of his 
income.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Next time take a look at some common practices in 
Sembia -- including some sly ones -- in which a typical merchant such as
 Mervos engages.</i></p>
