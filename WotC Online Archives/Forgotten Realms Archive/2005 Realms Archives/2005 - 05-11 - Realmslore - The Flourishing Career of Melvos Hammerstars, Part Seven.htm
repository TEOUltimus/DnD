<p align="left"><b>The Tireless Trader</b></p>
<p align="left">With his personal wealth quietly established in 
Saerloonian trading circles through his discreet performances in the 
larger sort of cointossing, Melvos Hammerstars has enough "street 
credit" (Sembians say "metal enough," from a line in an old, largely 
forgotten play, <i>Morlos the Mad Merchant</i>: "There's metal enough in his bottom for him to hold down <i>that</i> throne") to engage in <i>scrip trading.</i></p>
<p align="left">Scrip trading is where real money can be made in Sembian
 society. It's the daily grease that keeps Sembian commerce running. 
Unlike market-stall buying and selling of real goods, scrip trading is 
buying and selling paper documents (a very limited form of what we might
 call futures trading), and it works like this:</p>
<p align="left">If a "smallmerchant" by the name of Tharvos has 
invested, say, a 50-gp share in a cargo of lanterns coming by ship from 
Tsurlagol, but can no longer comfortably get along without that money 
(or no longer wants to buy those lanterns for his shop), he can go to 
certain dockside clubs (this practice began in taverns, but the Sembian 
love of privacy and safety soon caused traders' clubs to be established,
 with doorguards and entry rules) and offer to sell his share.</p>
<p align="left">Someone like Melvos Hammerstars, if interested, will 
offer 45 gp or so. Tharvos loses 5 gp, but gets paid the balance on the 
spot. Melvos now owns the share and can resell it for a higher amount 
(the scrip provided to Tharvos by the ship's captain, fleet owner, or 
trading coster says "50 gp" nowhere on it, but instead gives an amount 
of lanterns, some specifics as to their origin, construction, and 
quality, and a season or even a month for their arrival), or gather it 
with other scrips in hopes of cornering that year's market in such 
lanterns and perhaps driving up the price of each lantern by arranging 
temporary shortages of supply.</p>
<p align="left">Most scrips are for small amounts of goods and aren't 
hoarded for price-rigging, but merely bought and resold. Desperate 
sellers may end up with two-thirds or even less of what they originally 
paid, and some Sembian traders make a living just on the difference 
between what they pay for a scrip and what they sell it for, without 
ever actually handling any goods. As more than one ruler or senior 
courtier has commented (again employing an old quotation): "This is a 
leap into madness, but we see no lack of leapers!"</p>
<p align="left">Some wealthy Sembians have begun to buy and sell 
property deeds in this manner, and forgers have set to work -- forcing 
the Sembian government to establish both detailed neighborhood deed 
registries and <i>license-triads</i> of license-carrying local officials to oversee such sales.</p>
<p align="left">License-triads are trios of government officials chosen 
to represent different professions and levels of wealth, and for their 
personal dislike of each other. Their existence is intended to make 
bribing or blackmailing an official too difficult and expensive for most
 Sembians to contemplate.</p>
<p align="left">Sembian licenses are metal (usually tin, but sometimes 
zinc or even electrum) plates, pierced to be hung on wrist- or more 
often neck-chains, and stamped with the "Raven and Silver" device of 
Sembia and the official's name, title, and personal registry number. 
(Lawkeepers are given registry lists with "secret" questions entered for
 each name, so they can challenge anyone carrying a license for the 
correct answer, to have some means of exposing impostors).</p>
<p align="left">Melvos Hammerstars trades mainly in scrip for wines, spirits, and small <i>sundries</i>
 cargoes. Sundries are relatively nonperishable everyday items and 
supplies, such as lanterns, blank ledger books, inks, decorative locks 
and latches, windowpanes (small rectangles of glass mounted in metal 
frames that have fluted edges with rings attached, so panels can be 
slid-fastened together, and rods passed through the rings like 
window-bars to give an assembly of panes some stability, the ends of the
 rods being attached to larger frames), and weatherpouches (leather 
satchels made with toggle-thong-fastening overflaps to keep carried 
items -- usually documents -- as dry as possible).</p>
<p align="left">Melvos always tries to buy and then sell, making a 
modest profit on the difference, so as never to end up actually owning 
any goods when ships dock. He has a fear of getting caught with 
worthless, or <i>hardtar,</i> items, which are difficult to sell or, by 
their nature, to store. So he avoids more risky and high-profit cargoes 
such as ale, foodstuffs, fashion garments, and herbs (herb cargoes are 
notorious in Sembia for often providing a hiding-home for drugs and 
poisons, and the authorities keep watch over those dealing in them).</p>
<p align="left"><i>More examples of trading, along with some special secrets of our example merchant Mervos, await you in next week's article.</i></p>
