<p align="left">This chamber is a three-story ice prison. Halaster uses 
it to contain his "criminals" -- monstrous denizens of the dungeon that 
have tried to escape to the surface too many times. Many of the cells 
currently hold creatures. Halaster keeps the interior of the cells 
magically warm, and no creature contained within requires food or water 
while so confined. Of course, the prison walls are merely made of ice, 
and prisoners can break through them to escape, but Halaster takes care 
to imprison only those creatures that his helmed horrors can defeat. 
Having witnessed other creatures' escape attempts, the current prisoners
 simply languish or pace about in their cells, waiting for the day when 
Halaster's whim at last allows them to leave. Halaster keeps most of 
these criminals here for a few weeks before releasing them back to the 
dungeon. Most are happy to escape and accept the more expansive prison 
of Undermountain as their homes. Others persist in trying to leave 
Halaster's realm, and these Halaster toys with, imprisoning them again 
or letting them get close to a way out before snatching them back and 
placing them deeper in the dungeons than before.</p>
<p align="left">It amuses Halaster to allow others to enter the ice 
prison of their free will. He has instructed his helmed horrors to deal 
with them as they would escaped prisoners. Should things go awry and 
prisoners escape due to this open-door policy, it hardly bothers the Mad
 Mage. Escapees merely flee into Undermountain where he can watch and 
enjoy their foibles.</p>
<p align="left">The PCs can enter the ice prison through a single 
passage shut off from the rest of the dungeon by two sets of double 
doors. When the PCs approach the first set of double doors, read or 
paraphrase the following text. </p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">A chilly moistness emanates outward from this huge set 
of stone double doors. The two of them span the hall, each being nearly 5
 feet wide and 10 feet tall. The doors bear no ornament or decoration 
beyond utilitarian handles and a few words in Common, "Enter not ye who 
would live to leave." </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">These doors aren't locked or trapped and bear no magic. 
They stand as mute warning to those who would proceed farther. If the 
PCs open the doors, read the following text.</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond the doors are another set of double doors, and 
the cold trapped between the doors increases dramatically. Unlike the 
previous portal, this second set of double doors bears elaborate 
carvings of what could be stalactites but must be icicles considering 
the motifs of snow piles and snowflakes. Several long and thick stone 
icicles droop all the way down the door, resembling bars on a cage. A 
snowflake in the center of one door bears a dark keyhole. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">These doors are trapped to further deter the foolish. 
Halaster doesn't mind an occasional amusing intrusion into his prison, 
but he doesn't want the constant invasions of creatures wandering the 
dungeon. The trap also serves to deter creatures that can't read the 
warning on the first door.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Double Doors:</b> 4 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 60; break DC 28; Open Lock DC 30 (lock* [good]: hardness 15; hp 30).</p>

<p align="left">A creature affected by <i>mindfrost </i>feels an intense cold and an excruciating headache, but there is no outward sign of the effect.</p>

<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">Ice covers the floor of the huge, dimly lit chamber, and
 it forms walls as well as rooms, which line the exterior of this area. 
In the center stands a huge pillar of ice at least 15 feet thick. Inside
 it, about 15 feet above the floor, orange lights waver behind thick 
ice. The warping effect of the ice makes it impossible to tell the 
light's source, but the lights hover in what could be another chamber in
 the ice pillar. Some of the rooms are sealed by similar ice formations,
 though no light shines in these other areas. Instead, the ice-sealed 
rooms have dark shapes moving behind them. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the PCs decide to investigate the strange light more closely, read the following to the players.</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">A dim purple radiance shines through the ice, as well as
 around and below the orange glow. Both the brighter orange light and 
the dimmer lavender luminescence set the pillar aglow and sends a dim 
radiance across the chamber. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The orange brilliance comes from the flaming swords of 
five helmed horrors standing in the room beyond the wall. The purple 
radiance is the eerie light that shines within their hollow armored 
forms. Halaster placed the helmed horrors here to guard his prisoners. 
The prisoners lurk within their cells; they're the dark shapes moving 
behind the ice doors.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ice Pillar:</b> The ice pillar is hollow inside and 
has an opening 10 feet up from the floor on the side opposite the 
entrance to the ice prison.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ice Pillar:</b> 1 ft. thick; hardness 0; hp 72; break DC 30.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Falling Ice Wall Trap:</b> CR 5; mechanical; location
 trigger; repair reset; DC 20 Reflex save avoids if the PC is free to 
move to an adjacent square not affected by the trap; falling ice wall 
pins those beneath it (8d6, crush); multiple targets (pins all 
characters in the designated squares); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 
24.</p>
<p align="left">When a creature enters the ice prison and moves out of 
the designated squares, this trap activates and seals the entrance. Any 
creatures still in the designated area are damaged and pinned. A DC 20 
Escape Artist check allows a PC to slip out from under the wall. The ice
 wall is 5 feet thick and weighs 2,000 pounds. (This weight is spread 
out across the wall.) The PCs can work together to lift the ice wall. 
Each contributes double his maximum load in lifting power (pinned PCs 
can't contribute). If this is enough to exceed half the wall's weight, 
they can shift it enough to reduce the Escape Artist DC to 15 for pinned
 creatures. If the PCs can equal or exceed the wall's weight, they can 
lift it a few feet off the floor to free pinned creatures. The ice wall 
can't be moved away from the door due to the construction of the trap. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Ice Wall:</b> 5 ft. thick; hardness 0; hp 180; break DC 30; Escape Artist DC 20 or 15 (see above).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cell Door Trap:</b> CR 2; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Atk +10 melee (3d6, bludgeoning); Search DC 24; Disable Device DC 29.</p>
<p align="left">When a creature enters a cell, its ice door, which 
weighs 600 pounds, falls. Damage applies only to those underneath the 
cell door as it falls. Since the cell door is placed on a vertice rather
 than in a square, it is likely that only a Large or larger creature can
 be struck by it. A creature struck by the cell door is considered 
pinned beneath it until the portcullis is lifted. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Cell Door:</b> 1 ft. thick; hardness 0; hp 72; break DC 30.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cells: </b>Each cell has a 20-foot-high ceiling.<b></b>Halaster's
 powerful magic makes the prison cells habitable for any creature. 
Creatures within a cell with a closed and intact cell door need not 
breathe, eat, or drink while they remain in the cell. Upon leaving it, 
they are only as hungry as they were when placed inside. The temperature
 in the cell is about 50 degrees despite the surrounding ice. For the 
purposes of dispelling, these effects have a caster level of 30.</p>
<p align="left">A closed cell makes for a great place for the PCs to 
rest while in Undermountain. Of course, if the PCs destroy Halaster's 
helmed horror guards, it isn't long before he replaces them with 
something worse . . .</p><b>Helmed Horrors (5): </b> Use the statistics for the Helmed Horror (37/60) from the <i>Underdark</i> miniatures set or the statistics presented on page 175 of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/177380000">Lost Empires of Faerûn</a></i>. The helmed horrors all wield flaming weapons due to their weapon power ability. <p align="left">When
 the ice wall trap triggers or when the PCs otherwise make themselves 
apparent, the helmed horrors air walk out of the side of their icicle 
guard room and attack. They attack from one side, hoping to herd one or 
more PCs into one of the open cells. They never set foot on the ground, 
always air walking at least a few inches above it so they are never in 
danger of slipping on the ice.</p>
<p align="left">The helmed horrors strike for lethal damage, a tactic 
meant to convince a fleeing prisoner that going back into a cell is 
preferable to death. If a PC is near a cell doorway, a helmed horror 
might attempt to bull rush the PC inside.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prisoners: </b>The monsters imprisoned in the cells 
begin to attack or break the doors to their cells as soon as the PCs 
start fighting with the helmed horrors. The prisoners see the PCs' 
intrusion as their best opportunity to escape. Of course, once they 
escape their cells, the monsters are still locked in the prison with the
 PCs due to the ice wall trap. Negotiations with some of the prisoners 
are possible if the PCs didn't attack them during the fight with the 
helmed horrors, but the prisoners aren't very trusting of the PCs or 
each other. Place the prisoners in any of the closed cells, one per 
cell.</p>

is part of the treasure. The rest is 13,000 gp worth of coins and 
equipment inside the ice pillar. This treasure represents the items and 
wealth of escaping prisoners killed by the helmed horrors. Roll randomly
 on Table 3-5 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> using the 13th-level treasure entry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b></p>
<ul>
<li>The cells might hold an NPC the PCs are looking for, or a long-term NPC enemy might reside within one.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs might release to freedom a monster that they must later face
 in the dungeon. This option works best if the monster has a personality
 and name that the PCs learn. Several of the prisoners would work well.<br><br></li>
<li>If the PCs decide to rest in a cell, they might encounter Halaster 
himself. The Mad Mage won't be happy with the destruction they've 
wrought, and he gleefully transports them to another place in the 
dungeon. </li>
</ul>

</p><p align="LEFT"><b>About the Author </b></p> Once Editor-in-Chief of <i>Dragon </i>magazine and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain.<p></p>
