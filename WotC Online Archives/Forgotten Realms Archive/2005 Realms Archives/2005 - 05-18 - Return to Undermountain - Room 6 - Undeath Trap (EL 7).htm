<p align="left">A cacophony comes from the closed stone door before you,
 and its sound grows louder as you approach. Grinding shrieks of metal 
contrast with staccato booms and crackling noises. It sounds as if a 
tremendous battle is taking place in the room beyond. In fact, a 
particularly close explosion shakes the door on its hinges, causing a 
cascade of dust to puff from its seams. </p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The sounds continue indefinitely. When the PCs open a 
door to the room (or look in by some other means), read the following 
text:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">You peer into the room before you, and it resembles what
 an artist might depict when illustrating a layer of the Abyss. Jets of 
flame explode from the floor at random intervals and electricity 
crackles down from the ceiling to strike iron plates in the ground. 
Metal also whirls throughout the room as scythe blades and spikes 
project from the ceiling and floor and then whip away to hiding again. 
Amid all this chaos, a squat pillar stands in the rear of the room, and 
atop the pillar lies a jeweled chest. Great spiked chains bind the chest
 shut and tie it to the column. Below that, the roasted bones of some 
humanoid lie nearby, serving as a testament to the deadliness of the 
chamber. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The players will likely look for some pattern or trick 
to getting by the traps. If their PCs study the room for a while, read 
this:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">Four different traps activate in each square of the 
room: spikes, scythes, fire, and lightning. Over the course of about 6 
seconds, all four trap types activate once in a square, but their order 
or interval during that period is impossible to predict. You're certain 
no pattern exists to the traps' activation, but their random activation 
provides a measure of safety. Standing in place for too long would mean 
certain death, but if a person just keeps moving, it seems possible to 
avoid much of the danger. Also, there appears to be a safety zone 
immediately around the pillar. No traps affect a 5-foot radius area 
around it. </p>
</td>
</tr>

<p align="LEFT">At this point, ask the PCs to make an Intelligence check. If a PC gets a 14 or more, read the following text:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">After a quick mental calculation, you realize that 
someone moving through a square risks only one chance in three that a 
trap goes off. Multiple traps could go off at once, but such occurrences
 are very rare. </p>

<p align="LEFT">Halaster (see Return to Undermountain: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ru/20050309a">An Introduction</a>)
 designed this room as a vast trap to guard the treasure on the pillar. 
The fire, electricity, spikes, and scythe blades project at random 
intervals into each square. The bones by the pillar are all that remains
 of Sorci Laughmantle, now a ghost and one of the creatures in the room.
 Sorci isn't apparent at first glance (she is on the Ethereal Plane); 
she attacks once someone reaches for the treasure chest or the spiked 
chain (read Treasure below for a description of the chain).</p>
<p align="LEFT">This encounter is a puzzle encounter that can turn into 
an interesting fight. The players may devise a number of ways to get the
 chest from the room without entering it, and that's okay. The point is 
to get them to fight in the trapped room, not make them take tremendous 
damage getting to it. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Trying to lasso the chest won't work; the traps destroy the rope. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">Spells</a> such as <i>knock, open/close,</i> and <i>telekinesis </i>might
 prove very useful in moving the chest. However, the spiked chain is the
 real treasure, and it is firmly bound by a ring set in the pillar that 
the PCs can't see from the door. PCs might also try to get rid of the 
traps in the room. They could attack the spikes and scythes or dispel 
each fire and electricity trap. This should swiftly prove too dangerous 
and time consuming to be a good solution. Disabling each of them is an 
even poorer option since a PC may get hit by one of the traps, thus 
disrupting his concentration on the task. Buffing up one PC with spells 
and sending her in or sending in a summoned monster is probably the best
 option. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Regardless of how the PCs proceed, the real encounter 
starts when someone stands near the pillar to either get at the chest or
 spiked chain.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><b>Traps: </b></i>Each time a character enters or 
flies above a 5-foot square in the room, roll 1d10 for each type of 
trap. Consider rolling four d10s, each of a different color and each 
representing a single type of trap. On a roll of a 1, the trap 
activates. If a character remains in a square or above one for an entire
 round, all four traps automatically activate. If more than one 
character is in a square or above it when a trap activates, the trap 
affects all the characters in the square. You must be in a trap's square
 to disable it. The effects of the traps are detailed below.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A trap that has activated once in a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a>
 should not activate again that round. Thus, if one PC passes through a 
square and gets attacked by the fire trap, that fire trap should not 
affect another PC that passes through the same square in the same round.
 You can keep track of this by remembering which trap activated and 
removing its d10 the next time you roll in that round. Although that 
might sound complicated, the rarity of trap activation and the attention
 surrounding it should make it easy.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Sorci manifests as soon as someone enters the safe zone 
around the pillar and reaches for the chest, or as soon as someone moves
 the chest or chain from the pillar. Her goal is to prevent the chest 
and spiked chain from leaving the room. So she attacks a PC near the 
pillar or any PC with the chest or spiked chain. Her best tactic might 
be to use malevolence to take control of a PC and use him to fight his 
allies. Sorci is heedless of the traps whether she is attacking <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_incorporeal')">incorporeally</a> or using the body of a PC.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sorci was a young noblewoman who ventured into 
Undermountain with friends on a lark. She died trying to get at the 
chest, and her friends wouldn't risk retrieving her body. Now she haunts
 the chest and spiked chain, attacking those who try to get at the 
treasure she desired in life.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Someone who searches her bones (DC 10 Search check) can 
find a scorched brass ring in the shape of a heart still around one of 
her fingers. A very clever player (or a PC who makes a DC 15 
Intelligence check) might remember reading something about that in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ru/20050309b">Room 1: The Bottom of the Well</a>.
 Her gnome companion's writing on the wall in that room holds the secret
 to Sorci's permanent defeat: If someone simply says a prayer for Sorci 
while standing over her bones, she immediately disperses with a happy 
sigh and grateful look. If already defeated, this prevents Sorci from 
rejuvenating and seeking revenge on the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure: </b>The jeweled chest is a pretty fake. Its
 gems are merely cut glass, and it's worth 10 gp. Inside the chest is a 
leather bag filled with twenty gems of various colors. Each gem is 
flawed and worth only 10 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The true treasure is a <i>+1 adamantine spiked chain.</i>
 The chain is wrapped around the chest and pillar several times, and an 
iron ring set in the pillar's back holds it in place. (A DC 14 Use Rope 
check unties the spiked chain.) Each spiky link of the chain bears a 
different word in Infernal that is a synonym for wound. When touched by a
 creature, the chain glows red and sheds light like a <i>light</i> 
spell. Halaster took this spiked chain from a chain devil named 
Hexatron, imprisoning the fiend elsewhere in the dungeon and using his 
weapon to bait the trapped room.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The spiked chain once belonged to a chain devil named Hexatron. The
 PCs might meet him elsewhere in Undermountain, or he might come looking
 for his weapon.<br><br></li>
<li>You can increase the difficulty of the encounter by increasing the 
frequency of the trap activations. If you use d8s instead of d10s, a 
trap activates roughly 40% of the time, and multiple traps activate more
 often. Similarly, d6s cause at least one trap to activate 50% of the 
time a creature enters a square, and using d4s causes it to happen 70% 
of the time, with multiple traps activating being even more likely.<br><br></li>
<li>You can increase the difficulty of this encounter by putting the PCs' goal farther across a room.<br><br></li>
<li> You could use this trap room with a different encounter. You could 
use other incorporeal undead, such as shadows, or you could have the 
traps not be immediately visible and have a villain pull a lever that 
activates them as he flees the room.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs might be asked by the Laughmantles to retrieve Sorci's 
remains. Alternatively, the remains might belong to someone the PCs 
know.</li>

<p align="left"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
