<p>Read the following as the party passes through the double doors:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> The large, double doors open into a vast, 
darkness-filled chamber. The darkness does not allow a complete view of 
how wide it actually is. Barely visible are two columns of aged and 
chipped stone rising 12 feet to the ceiling. To the west is a stout 
wooden door. On the east is a short passage that ends in a blank wall. 
Running from the center of the double doors is a rotted carpet; 
occasional patches of color amid its ruin indicate that it was once 
blood red in hue. At the far end of the room, you make out the presence 
of a light, such as that emanating from a hearth fire.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The room itself has no furnishings, nor any light 
source, until the PCs come to the northern third of the chamber. The six
 columns toward the entrance hold fading runes of an ancient and archaic
 nature. Most represent warding symbols with no power left in them and 
others are indecipherable due to age. The carpet is so worn away it does
 nothing to muffle footsteps. Carved upon the trigger block for the 
secret door is the Dwarven word that means "to open."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once the party comes within viewing distance of the southernmost of the northern columns, read the following text:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"> The aged stone and tattered carpet end at the edge of a
 plush red carpet that has golden runes traced into its edge. The two 
northernmost columns are made of shining brass and have relief carvings 
of flames running the entire length of them. Spread throughout the area 
beyond are multiple fine furnishings, including a darkwood desk and 
chair with magnificent carvings adorning them. A hearth stands in the 
center of the northernmost wall, and a fire spreads a comforting light 
about the area. Above it sits a bejeweled longsword mounted upon an oak 
backboard.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The most peculiar feature of the area is the large 
red-skinned, horned humanoid sitting in the chair in the center of the 
area. Dressed in fine silks of varied colors, he speaks in a deep 
baritone, "I welcome you, mortals. Come to chat with an old riddler?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Halaster originally created this room as a means to test
 his seven apprentices for when they eventually, he knew, would come 
looking for him. As one of his earliest additions to the Underhalls, he 
sectioned it off from the rest of the complex by two well-hidden secret 
doors. In this room he summoned, bound, and put into service a genie, or
 more specifically, an efreeti. After his apprentices finally gathered, 
Halaster decided to leave the genie imprisoned as both an obstacle and 
reward for those who decided to delve into his underground fortress.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Contained in a modified <i>binding</i> circle and <i>wall of force,</i> the mad wizard bound the genie to grant 101 <i>wishes</i> before he would be freed. (Review the efreeti's spell-like abilities and the <i>wish</i> spell before running this encounter; Mov'Harath is still bound by daily limitations.) Before he could grant these <i>wishes</i>
 though, the person must answer a constantly changing riddle. After many
 centuries, failed attempts at answering riddles, and the occasional 
success, the efreeti, called Mov'Harath, is down to just one riddle to 
be answered. Here is where things turn difficult.</p>
<p align="LEFT">During the Time of Troubles, a battle broke out in 
Waterdeep with Myrkul's minions. Some of the City Guard that died in 
that battle rose again as curst. One of these unfortunates, Brelson, 
wandered many years in and around the City of the Dead, Waterdeep's 
graveyard, looking for a way to return to life. With no luck in his 
endeavor, the undead almost gave up hope, until he overheard one of the 
few adventurers to have returned from Undermountain telling of a <i>wish</i>-granting
 genie. This was his chance. After passing through the Yawning Portal 
disguising his true nature, he spent many weeks on the upper level of 
the dungeon looking for this elusive genie. Little did he suspect that 
when he found him, there would be a riddle to answer to gain his reward.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For the past eleven years, Brelson has stayed here in 
the genie's room trying to answer his riddles. As of yet, thanks to his 
low <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Wisdom')">Wisdom</a>
 scores (6 and 2 respectively), he has yet to correctly answer it. After
 all, the riddles originally were meant for aspiring wizards of quick 
wit and great intellect. In his frustration, and due to the chaotic 
nature of all curst, he has pleaded adventurers that correctly answer to
 save him from his undeath as many times as he has slain them to keep 
the genie's last <i>wish</i> for himself.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most of the preceding information can be gleaned in 
conversation with both Mov'Harath and Brelson. As a rule, determine 
beforehand Brelson's demeanor before the party enters the room. 
Typically, he approaches them from the darkness before they reach the 
northern half of the room inhabited by the efreeti. He has a 50% chance 
of being quite docile initially; otherwise he is depressed or arrogant 
and even violent to the characters. He also has the standard 5% chance 
per combat round of suddenly acting irrationally.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Mov'Harath has become very perturbed by his predicament over the past eleven years. With only one <i>wish</i>
 left, adventurers have consistently gotten the riddle wrong, fled 
Brelson's wrath only to be hunted down and killed, or defeated Brelson 
only to have him regenerate and annoy the genie with his continued 
presence.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sample riddles are provided here:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Fires of destruction praise my touch yet mourn my tears,</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Though I am unseen you see my travels,</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>My voice is as quiet as a mouse, yet louder than thunder's roar,</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>I tread the very mountains with ease yet water is as impassable as stone.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Answer: Wind.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>You feel my kiss when you first see light and know my embrace as darkness falls,</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>I am king to no one, though everything bows before me,</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Empires fall before my might, but the most delicate flower's blooming I cannot stop.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Answer: Time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the characters decide to take on the riddle, only one answer and <i>wish</i> can be granted, so they have only one opportunity. The riddle itself appears as shimmering words upon the <i>wall of force</i>
 that runs between the four large pillars at the northern end of the 
room. If correctly answered, the genie's bonds are broken, but it still 
takes 3 rounds for the magic to fully dissipate. Then the genie is once 
again free to act and use all of his spell-like abilities (minus any he 
used earlier). By answering, the party basically has three options:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Help the Curst</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the event the characters correctly answer the riddle,
 they may wish for the curst to be returned to life. Mov'Harath actually
 takes offense to this if he has told the party his story of the past 
eleven years with Brelson. To him, the party has just aided his would-be
 captor. Once the barriers are down, Mov'Harath attacks the party and 
curst alike.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Despite being free of undeath, and because he spent so 
long in his condition, Brelson's alignment remains chaotic neutral and 
he still has the chance to act irrationally. He could thank the party 
and offer his services, flee at the first sign of danger from the genie,
 or even flee so that he can later assassinate the party to prevent word
 of his own heinous acts ever reaching outside ears.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Help Themselves</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs make a <i>wish</i> that helps themselves 
only, Brelson becomes enraged and attacks the party for 2 rounds. 
Fearing the genie's retribution, he flees during the third round but 
promises vengeance on the party for leaving him in his sorry state.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Help No One</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If the party decides not to attempt the riddle, Brelson 
has a 50% chance to become withdrawn and depressed; otherwise he is 
extremely hostile to the PCs. Leaving Mov'Harath trapped certainly does 
nothing to engender respect for these "cowardly mortals." If ever freed,
 Mov'Harath could come after the party while simultaneously planning his
 revenge on Brelson, if he yet survives, potentially doubling the 
party's enemies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mov'Harath: </b>hp 90; see page 114 of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">Monster Manual</a></i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Brelson (male curst fighter 6): </b>hp 65; see page 165 of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/177380000">Lost Empires of Faerûn</a>. </i>You should add a level, replace the leather armor with a breastplate, and replace the bastard sword with a <i>+2 bastard sword. </i>Additionally, make adjustments for his Wisdom of 2.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The only treasure is the breastplate and <i>+2 bastard sword</i> used by Brelson.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins </b><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs could have heard the same rumors that Brelson had heard about a <i>wish</i>-granting genie located in the upper levels of Undermountain.<br><br></li>
<li> A lone adventurer tells of a creature guarding a genie who, after 
being destroyed by his party, kept returning to hunt his group down. 
This sole adventurer is the only survivor of that group, and he is 
offering a large reward to anyone who helps him gain vengeance.<br><br></li>
<li> A cleric of Lathander recently returning from Undermountain swears 
by his god that he encountered a creature that resembled his dead older 
cousin, whom he lost in the battle with Myrkul fifteen years ago. After 
the undead creature was turned, the priest lost track of him.<br><br></li>
<li> Because of his regenerative powers, the curst could make quite a 
reoccurring villain for the party if they didn't help him regain his 
life.<br><br></li>
<li> Helping Brelson could certainly earn Mov'Harath's enmity, putting 
the party at the top of his revenge list just under Brelson himself.<br><br></li>
<li> If the party could not correctly answer the riddle, they could still find a way to save Brelson from his current state.<br><br></li>
<li> If they returned Brelson to life, the adventurers could help Brelson atone for his past crimes as an undead.</li>
