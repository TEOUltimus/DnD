<p align="left"><b>The Silent Landlord</b></p>
<p align="left">With some of the terms and daily environment surrounding
 Melvos Hammerstars covered, we can begin to examine just a few of his 
thousands of business ventures. It should be remembered that nearly 
every Sembian possessing wits and physical fitness enough to be in 
business for themselves has a similar array of such interests.</p>
<p align="left">As mentioned earlier, Hammerstars openly engages in the 
following Saerloonian business interests: wine-blending, running a crew 
that fixes tile roofs, what we would call a "silent partner" investment 
in a cobbler's shop, and through the Sundul Full Palm coinring, part 
ownership of two tallhouses on Pranthar's Street that return rental 
income. These "public" (that is, revealed to government agents, <i>not</i> to anyone asking him questions in a tavern or on the street) activities bring in only a sixth of his income.</p>
<p align="left">Hammerstars earns the majority of his coins by many means. One such is being a landlord.</p>
<p align="left">In the name of a deceased former business partner, 
Darmeer Horath, Hammerstars collects the rents on three Saerloonian 
tallhouses. One is a very seedy "by-the-room" building near the docks, 
and (using names not his own) Hammerstars rents three rooms in it as 
various unseen boots (absent) tenants, and subleases each of these rooms
 to up to six lodgers. These coins cover his daily living costs (mainly 
food). Long ago, Horath made an arrangement with Tarmrose &amp; Sons, a 
certain Westgate-based importing firm (actually engaged in smuggling 
drugs and spirits), that this decaying tallhouse would be their official
 city offices, so they could pretend to be a Sembian firm and avoid 
heavy import duties on their "cover" cargoes. Tarmrose pays the annual 
ownership head taxes for the building through a <i>traveling factor</i> 
(third-party trade agent from Westgate), and in return Hammerstars gives
 him the entirely anonymous use of a suite in one of the other two 
tallhouses as a hidey-hole when he has need of it. So Tarmrose need 
never come within half the city of his offices -- if the authorities 
ever become suspicious of his cargoes.</p>
<p align="left">Horath died "on caravan" outside Sembia, and the 
authorities aren't yet aware of his demise. They're looking for him, for
 unpaid taxes -- but then, they're looking for a <i>lot</i> of people 
for unpaid taxes. Hammerstars pretends to be Horath's hired rent 
collector, but to be himself waiting for Horath to pay him for this 
service. He has (forged) deed-claims ready for the day when the 
government tries to seize the buildings (which they can do for Sembians 
who die without heirs, despite creditors -- but <i>not</i> despite deed-claimants).</p>
<p align="left">Thus the rents from this Manynets Lane tallhouse are 
untaxed profit for Hammerstars, who does no maintenance on the place. He
 can't get windstorm or <i>tumbledown</i> (building collapse) <i>surety</i>
 (insurance), but does have a fire bond -- and a covert standing 
arrangement with a nearby street gang (whom he pays watch-money to, 
every tenday, for spying on the doings of his tenants and the neighbors)
 to set fires in the ruins should the tallhouse ever collapse.</p>
<p align="left">The second and third rental properties stand on the far 
more respectable Bellmaur Street. One is entirely given over to nicely 
furnished half-floor suites that command monthly rents of as much as 12 
gp. The only Hammerstars "funny business" here is a single suite out of 
its four floors stands empty for either his use as a hidey-hole or 
meeting place for shady negotiations, or as a place he can rent to 
business acquaintances (for <i>very</i> steep fees) if they ever need a hidey-hole in a hurry.</p>
<p align="left">The other tallhouse has a seamstress on the ground 
floor, and three stories of expensive full-floor rental living suites 
above. The trick here is that the seamstress, Lharal of the Needles, is 
not just a seamstress: she's the madam of her own high-coin brothel, 
located on the floor immediately above hers. Lharal pays taxes as a 
seamstress, but the bedwarmers upstairs pay none, and she "forgets" to 
notice her share of their takings -- just as Hammerstars splits that 
share with her in return for paying the head tax for an entirely 
fictitious renter of that floor, and overlooking what's really going on.
 Should he or a business friend he wants to cozen show up to share beds,
 they pay no warming fees.</p>
<p align="left">Melvos is careful to pay his full taxes promptly on all 
properties he openly and personally owns, and he does what most 
struggling-up-from-lowcoin Sembian merchants do: buy buildings adjacent 
to his own whenever they become available, in hopes of someday selling a
 large block of land at a handsome profit to someone who wants to put up
 large tallhouses or a mansion.</p>
