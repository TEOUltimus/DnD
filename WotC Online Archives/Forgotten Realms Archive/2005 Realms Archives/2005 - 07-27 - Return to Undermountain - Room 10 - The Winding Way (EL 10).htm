<p align="LEFT">This encounter works best if the PCs are a couple levels lower than the EL. An area-affecting spell like <i>lightning bolt</i> or <i>fireball</i>
 can make quick work of the ophidians on the causeway. If this happens 
and the PCs are having an easy time with the encounter, consider having 
more ophidians climb up from below.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs look into the room, read this text:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">A damp causeway covered in puddles of water stretches 
across this chamber to a doorway on the far side. To either side of the 
causeway lies a long drop into darkness. From the gloom below you can 
hear water splashing. To either side of the causeway stand walls that 
reach 20 feet up to the ceiling above. The walls on either side of the 
causeway have holes large enough for a man to crawl into. It's hard to 
tell from your vantage point, but it seems like the holes don't go far 
into the wall before they turn downward.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Note: The drop is so deep that even a dwarf's darkvision
 cannot reveal what would stop a fall, so DMs should mention this if a 
party member has such vision. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Have the players make Listen checks and Spot checks. A 
PC that succeeds at the Spot check is not surprised when the ophidians 
slither onto the causeway. Read the following text:</p>
<table bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">Suddenly several snakelike beings slide up onto the 
causeway from its sides. Even as they do so, their skin changes color 
from the grays and black of the damp stone to a ruddy orange. They draw 
swords and hiss a challenge at you.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">PCs who failed their Spot checks are surprised, but the 
ophidians make no immediate move to attack. Instead, the first one waves
 with his sword in a threatening and challenging manner for the PCs to 
approach. The ophidians are guarding their mistress, a bright naga in 
counsel with two clerics of Bane several rooms away.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The ophidians speak Common but they can't be reasoned 
with or tricked unless someone speaks to them in Yuan-ti and claims to 
be a member of that race. This gives them pause, and successful Bluff 
and Intimidate checks convince them to lead the PCs to the bright naga 
and the clerics. The cowed ophidians explain the workings of the 
causeway and its dangers, and they escort the PCs, some going ahead to 
alert the bright naga of the "yuan-ti" visitors and others moving ahead 
and behind the PCs. Should the PCs keep this ruse going, it confuses 
both the naga and the clerics of Bane, allowing the PCs the element of 
surprise.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs talk for too long or start spellcasting, the 
ophidians nearest the entrance move to attack and the other ophidians 
file forward, all of them being curiously cautious to step in the 
diagonals. This gives their movement across the causeway a serpentine 
appearance that could be mistaken for their natural inclination, but a 
DC 15 Sense Motive check reveals they're trying to avoid certain areas 
of the walkway. Stepping in those areas (marked with an X on the map) 
results in the activation of a trap. See "Water Rush Traps" below for 
more details.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The two clerics of Bane have come to the bright naga's 
lair to convince her to undertake the ritual to become a banelar naga 
(see page 72 of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/965660000">Serpent Kingdoms</a></i>).
 If the naga converts to worship of Bane, they intend to use her and her
 ophidian minions to guard a secret temple to Bane being carved out of 
Undermountain. Even now, they have hired adventurers working to clean 
out an area of monsters so that they can construct defenses and 
repurpose that area of the dungeon. The two clerics and bright naga come
 running as soon as a water rush trap is set off. They arrive in 4 
rounds and enter the combat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Water Rush Traps:</b> CR 1: mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; Bull rush +6; Search DC 15; Disable Device DC 20.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each square marked with an X on the map is the trigger 
for hundreds of gallons of water to come rushing out of a hole in the 
wall to spray across the causeway over the two adjacent squares to the 
east. Thus, as someone moves across the causeway to the west, water 
sprays through the squares behind that person with each step onto a 
trapped square. The trapped squares cause a rush of water only when 
first depressed. Therefore, any creature stepping on a trapped square 
causes a rush of water when it first enters the square, but the water 
then ceases until the weight is removed and then put on the square 
again. It takes 10 pounds of pressure to cause a rush of water.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A creature in a square through which a rush of water 
passes is subject to a bull rush attempt. The water pushes with a +6 
bonus on the opposed Strength check. If the water wins, the PC is pushed
 back 5 feet. If the water wins by 5 or more, the PC is pushed 10 feet. A
 PC pushed off the causeway may make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the 
edge. Failure results in a fall to the water below (see Falling or 
Diving Off the Causeway).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The ophidians, clerics of Bane, and bright naga all know
 how these traps work and what squares are safe to step on. They use the
 traps to their advantage, staying off the trapped squares until a foe 
steps forward into the spaces the water would spray through. Whether a 
PC moves in front of or beside his foe, the PCs' foe need only 5-foot 
adjust to a nearby square to set off the trap and send a water rush to 
push the PC off the causeway. Of course, a PC might tumble or simply 
move around an ophidian, a tactic they are at first unprepared for, but 
then they stand side-by-side to block the causeway and step on and off 
the trapped squares to use the water against the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Make sure to keep track of the PCs' movement on the 
causeway. They too can set off the traps, and if they are not careful, a
 PC might end up accidentally setting off a water rush trap so that it 
affects another PC.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Falling or Diving Off the Causeway </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The water 70 feet below the causeway is 30 feet deep, so
 any creature falling off the causeway takes 3d6 points of damage plus 
1d3 points of nonlethal damage. A creature deliberately diving off the 
causeway can make a DC 20 Swim or Tumble check to take no damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The ophidians have long practice turning falls off the 
causeway into dives. Due to their ability to take 10 on Swim checks 
despite distractions, the ophidians never suffer damage for falling or 
diving off the causeway. However, if affected by something that 
penalizes a Swim check (such as diminishing the ophidian's Strength), an
 ophidian must roll a Swim check when falling from the causeway because 
taking 10 will not be sufficient.</p>

<ul>
<li> If the PCs don't succeed in killing the clerics and the naga, the 
clerics use the PCs' intrusion to reinforce the naga's need for more 
power and protection. She agrees to the ritual that will make her a 
banelar naga, and the clerics of Bane assign her first task as a 
disciple of Bane: Hunt the PCs down and destroy them.<br><br></li>
<li> The clerics of Bane are building a secret temple beneath Waterdeep!
 Perhaps one of the clerics carries a note to this effect that alerts 
the PCs to the danger. The PCs might need to find a group of adventurers
 somewhere else in Undermountain and convince them they're doing the 
work of the church of Bane, or they might have to defeat a group of 
mercenary adventurers that knows and does not care that they're working 
for evil. Alternatively, maybe disguised clerics of Bane hire the PCs to
 clear out an area of Undermountain under some false pretense.<br><br></li>
<li> If you'd like to make this encounter tougher on the PCs, consider turning the bright naga into a dark naga (<i>Monster Manual</i> page 191). A CR 8 dark naga would raise the EL to 11.</li>

<p align="left"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon, 
running pell-mell through traps and past monsters because what chases 
them is worse. When he wrote that, Matthew was thinking about 
Undermountain. </p>
