<p align="left"><b>Listen DC 22: </b>Whether through the secret door to 
the south or the normal door to the west, a character can hear the orcs 
whispering by succeeding to this degree on a Listen check. Beating the 
DC by 10 or more allows a PC to hear that the orcs are arguing about

distance from the nearest door, the DC increases by +1.</p>

<p align="left">The floor about the door is strewn with caltrops, and 
the walls of this dusty room bear engravings of robed figures bearing 
staffs, wands, scrolls, spellbooks, and other symbols of arcane 
spellcasting. It also holds three snarling orcs warriors! Already on 
their feet when you enter, they draw their weapons and shout at you in 
their crude language.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Three orc warriors rest in this room. Their squad was on
 patrol in the northern part of level one of the dungeon when three 
trolls attacked it. These three fled through the tunnels along with two 
companions, and a troll stayed close on their heels. A trap claimed one 
orc, and the troll stopped to eat it. The remaining four orcs continued 
to flee, and they finally decided to rest in this room. Confused by 
their long flight through the dungeon, the orcs sent their least injured
 companion to scout and get their bearings. She hasn't returned. Now 
healed and ready to continue, the orcs are settling an argument about 
what to do by playing a game of knucklebones. One orc wants to set out 
together to find their tribe; another wants to find a way to flee to the
 surface, fearing that the tribe won't accept them after their cowardice
 and long absence; and the third wants to look for their scout.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Although eager for the outcome of their contest, the 
orcs are worried about being trapped in the room (they don't know about 
the secret door), and they keep an ear cocked for sounds outside their 
room. (DMs may want to allow the orcs to make Listen checks of their 
own.) If confronted by PCs who outnumber them, the orcs try to frighten 
them off, shouting in Orc and brandishing their weapons. The orcs attack
 wounded PCs or a number of PCs of equal or smaller number. In either 
case, the orcs attempt to flee if the fighting goes poorly, jumping over
 the caltrops and heading north and west.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Orc Warriors (3):</b> hp 5 each; <i>Monster Manual</i> page 203 (or use the statistics for the Orc Warrior miniature from the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/965800000">Harbinger</a></i>set). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The PCs can collect the orcs' equipment
 and three bags worth of caltrops from the floor. In addition, the walls
 of the room are carved with cleverly hidden spells. Wizards can learn 
these spells and copy them into their spellbooks according to the rules 
in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. The spells are <i>arcane eye, binding, hold portal, light,</i> and <i>arcane sensitivity</i>. <i> Arcane sensitivity </i>, presented here, appears in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/179290000">Shining South</a></i>, a sourcebook for the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>
 setting. This book contains tons of great spells, monsters, magic 
items, and plot ideas that you can easily adapt for your campaign.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Adventure Hooks and Tie-Ins</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You can make the encounter more difficult by using tougher orcs. A 
number of orc miniatures could provide a greater challenge to your 
players' PCs. Here are a few: Orc Archer (CR 1, <i>Harbinger</i>), Orc Berserker (CR 1, <i>Harbinger</i>), Orc Spearfighter (CR 2, <i>Harbinger</i>), Orc Brute (CR 1, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/967010000">Giants of Legend</a></i>), Orc Champion (CR 7, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966250000">Archfiends</a></i>), Orc Raider (CR 3, <i>Archfiends</i>), Mountain Orc (CR 2, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966240000">Aberrations</a></i>), Orc Sergeant (CR 3, <i>Aberrations</i>), Orc Savage (CR 2, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndmin/966280000">Deathknell</a></i>). <br><br></li>
<li> One of the spells on the wall could be a spell long lost to wizards
 and unknown to sorcerers. When the PCs cast it or talk about it in 
public, a group of evil wizards sets about stealing the spellbook from 
the PC wizard.<br><br></li>
<li> The spells on the wall are an excellent way to introduce spells you
 want your players' PCs to cast. Also, granting them knowledge of a 
spell they wouldn't cast (such as a spell with the Evil descriptor) can 
prepare them to face its use by an NPC at a later point. <br><br></li>
<li> If the PCs talk to the orcs, the encounter can end without 
bloodshed. The orcs want only to be left alone, and they leave if 
allowed. This might make the orcs friendly to the PCs during a later 
encounter, possibly winning them allies in a later battle with orcs. </li>

<p align="left">Once editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon Magazine</i> and now a game designer at Wizards of the Coast, <b>Matthew Sernett</b> wrote in a <i>Dragon</i> editorial that there's nothing in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 he likes better than when the adventurers flee through the dungeon,
