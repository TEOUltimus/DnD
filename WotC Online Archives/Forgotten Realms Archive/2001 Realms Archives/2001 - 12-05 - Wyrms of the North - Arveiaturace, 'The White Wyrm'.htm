<p class="size2"><img src="2001%20-%2012-05%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Arveiaturace,%20%27The%20White%20Wyrm%27_files/dragon_231_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">The
 inquisitive (not to mention foolish) explorations of the famous 
traveler and author Volo, filtered through Elminster, have yielded 
details of another dragon of the North: Arveiaturace the White Wyrm, 
known to sailors and minstrels alike as Iceclaws, thanks to her habit of
 drifting low over ships sailing off the Sword Coast and plucking up 
crew members for quick snacks.</p>
<p class="size2">This ancient white dragon is feared by all sailors who 
ply the shipping lanes of the Sword Coast, except for those who dismiss 
her as a legend -- until it's too late. The Flying Hunt of Nimbral and 
several aerial patrols from Evermeet have fought her in midair and 
forced her into flight on occasion, but most ships are helpless against 
her diving attacks -- and when crews scramble down into their holds to 
escape her snatching claws, she's been known to land on a ship and tear 
it apart like a child opening a gift. What makes Arveiaturace so deadly 
is her past: She was the steed of a wizard, Meltharond Thone, who 
captured and tamed her. Over the centuries of her servitude, her hatred 
for him turned slowly to love, and she was plunged into melancholy when 
at last, longevity magic failing, he died (sometime around 1326 DR).</p>
<p class="size2">When she is especially lonely or going into battle, 
Arveiaturace straps the wizard's old palanquin on her back, and takes to
 the skies with his skeletal figure riding between her shoulders. A web 
of desperate magics spun by Meltharond in his waning days keep his bones
 whole and floating in proper relation to each other, so the wizard's 
skeleton sits upright and turns its head to look in whichever direction 
Iceclaws is looking. An observer could be forgiven for thinking 
Meltharond is a lich or some other sort of undead, but the dragon is 
truly alone, save on the rare occasions when she mates with the white 
dragon Arauthator -- occasions during which Meltharond's skeleton is 
left at home, sitting and eternally looking at nothing.</p>
<p class="size2">The wizard may be no more than bones now, but his 
legacy has kept his faithful steed alive in the face of attacks from 
strange dragons, elves, and humans seeking to rid themselves of her 
hunting, and her own offspring as well, whom she drives from the Icepeak
 to fend for themselves as soon as they grow bold enough to try to slay 
her and take over her lair. Meltharond's magical boons are twofold: he 
crafted her a <i>ring of spell triggering</i> that allows her to trigger
 the wands, rods, and staves he left behind, and he taught her such rare
 and useful magic as she does know. She knows how wizards hurl magic, 
what tactics they employ, and how to recognize some popular battle 
spells (such as <i>fireball</i> and <i>lightning bolt</i>) by their 
castings. This and a familiarity with various wands, rods, and staves 
makes her crafty in battle against mages. One such tactic is flying low 
in the troughs of waves, so as to entice a wand-wielding wizard to waste
 magic by firing at a glimpse of her, only to have his attack absorbed 
or turned aside by the roiling waters. (In seas of 5 ft. or more, 
consider this one-quarter cover. In seas of 10 ft. or more, consider 
this one-half cover.) Another is toppling masts down atop mages standing
 on decks trying to work spells.</p>
<p class="size2">Arveiaturace is more intelligent -- and vastly more 
sensitive -- than most white dragons, but she has all the savagery and 
snarling hunger for revenge of her kind. She grew so used to the company
 of Meltharond (who chatted with her constantly, treating her as an 
equal despite the spells that prevented her from attacking him) that 
she's now governed by loneliness and has been known to spare sailors and
 others she snatches if they don't like wizards, don't attack her, and 
have the quick wits to shout out a desire to talk (or demonstrate an 
ability to sing) before she bites the life from them.</p>
<p class="size2">Several humans have escaped from a snatching by 
Arveiaturace having endured nothing more than a month or so of 
conversation with the terrifying, always-suspicious, and vigilant 
Iceclaws. If captives refrain from attacking her or stealing anything of
 Meltharond's that still lies about his rooms, largely as he left it 
(including many items of magic and spellbooks, some accounts say), 
they'll be taken to the locale of their choice on mainland Faerûn as 
soon as they admit to any loneliness. It is from such former guests that
 the wider world knows details of the White Wyrm and her lair.</p>
<p class="size2">It would be a mistake to conclude from this that 
Arveiaturace is gentle, kind, or has a soft spot for humans. She is 
clearly looking for a companion she can trust, but evil wizards who 
would refrain from cheating her, doing her other harm, or trying to 
enslave her -- and yet share her love for destruction and acquisition of
 treasure -- are just as clearly all too rare. Her loneliness drives her
 to answer the calls of the white dragon Arauthator to mate, but the 
White Wyrm deals savagely with intruders who sail too close to the isle 
where she lairs, and she has been known to leave her territory to hunt 
down adventurers who have entered her lair and then gone elsewhere in 
Faerûn.</p>
<p class="size2">Arveiaturace is more patient than most white dragons, 
but when roused to battle, she loves to lose all self-control and slay 
and destroy until nothing remains to withstand her. She knows the winds 
and waves of the Sea of Swords and Sword Coast (and the Trackless Sea 
east of a line from Uttersea to the Wave Rocks and the northern shores 
of Lantan) better than any other living entity, and she is adept at 
sinking ships and at plucking things from masts, decks, and the waves 
without slowing down or tumbling into even the roughest seas.</p>
<p class="size2">Arveiaturace seems bent on devouring a hungry dragon's 
share of all Sword Coast seafarers and in making dragons and lesser 
races alike terrified of venturing north of Ruathym. On rare occasions 
she will use her skills to rescue shipwreck victims or retrieve floating
 items -- if rewarded with generous amounts of gems and treated with 
respect, as an equal and not some semi-intelligent, easily-manipulated 
beast.</p>
<p class="size2">Over the years, she has developed a relationship of 
mutual respect with Laeral, the Lady Mage of Waterdeep, and with the 
seafarer and shipwright Old Aldon of Mintarn, but the White Wyrm is 
spoken of with awe and fear in Candlekeep: She once heard from a captive
 that a certain sage of that establishment had written disparagingly of 
Meltharond. She arrived unannounced to tear the roof from the main 
building, snatch up the writer, and set straight his views on the dead 
wizard. It's reported that less than a month later, Laeral of Waterdeep 
personally delivered a freshly printed tome from Candlekeep entitled <i>The High History of the Mighty Mage Meltharond</i>
 to the White Wyrm, and stayed with the dragon for more than a tenday, 
talking day and night through. She has refused to answer queries as to 
just what was discussed, but sailors have noticed that the White Wyrm 
now seems to turn a blind eye to vessels sailing near Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Arveiaturace's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Iceclaws makes her lair in a frigid complex of caverns 
high up in the eastern face of the Icepeak, an isolated island south of 
the Sea of Moving Ice and west of Fireshear. They lie beside smaller 
chambers that were once the sanctum of Meltharond Thone. In fact, 
Arveiaturace dug her caves so that she could carefully remove the walls 
along one side of the wizard's rooms, to allow her access to them with 
snout and claw without destroying them with her bulk.</p>
<p class="size2">The rock of the Icepeak is soft, crumbling easily under
 a dragon's claws or a climber's boots alike, and Arveiaturace took the 
time to sculpt out spaces large enough for her to turn easily in, beat 
her wings, and sprawl at ease. Unfortunately, such huge caverns are 
inherently unstable; bits of the roof keep falling when she brushes them
 with an upraised wing, or when she lands heavily. (Ice at the three 
entry caves often makes her skid as she lands.) Eventually the White 
Wyrm may find herself at the bottom of a roofless ledge, with a fifth or
 more of the Icepeak that was once above her gone.</p>
<p class="size2">Outside each cave entrance is a sheer drop onto jagged 
rocks, and few creatures dare to dwell on the Icepeak with a hungry 
white dragon. There are rumors of gnome tunnels that reach up from deep 
under the sea into the heart of the Icepeak. Also, the more foolish sort
 of adventurers come visiting the island all too often, drawn by tales 
of the back wall of the deepest of the White Wyrm's caverns: the wall 
that glitters from roof to floor with heaped diamonds. Some believe 
these tales to be true, although a few also mention a side cavern 
crammed with Arveiaturace's other treasure, all tumbled carelessly 
together: suits of armor, coins, all gems except diamonds, weapons, and 
other things that look important or valuable, perhaps even magic items 
(Iceclaws ignores likely-looking items that she seizes, using only 
things of magic she knows to have belonged to Meltharond). At least one 
stone golem lies stiffly among the heaped wealth, its origin and means 
of control unknown. Adventurers hearing talk of the Icepeak lair in 
dockside taverns up and down the Sword Coast are warned that a hill of 
cracked and gnawed bone fragments has built up on the rocks below the 
caves of the White Wyrm -- and that almost all of those bones belonged 
to human adventurers before they provided Arveiaturace with a meal.</p>
<p class="size2">One of the wands crafted by Meltharond can generate <i>unseen servants</i>,
 and the White Wyrm often makes use of these forces to manipulate small 
items that are beyond her personal reach or Dexterity, but it is thought
 that no creatures serve Arveiaturace in her lair or elsewhere, and that
 she avoids formal alliances or ties that can summon her to battle.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Arveiaturace's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From the Icepeak, Arveiaturace holds sway over a 
territory that stretches along the Trackless Sea east of Evermeet from 
Tuern and the Sea of Moving Ice (where long-necked monsters lair under 
the ice and erupt to do battle) in the north to the shores of Lantan in 
the south, and east to take in the coastal shores and headlands from 
Tethyr north to Mount Sar beyond Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2">Arveiaturace has been known to make forays into the 
Crags and northern Neverwinter Wood, but other dragons (notably the 
green dragon Claugiyliamatar) dispute her right to freely enter this 
region. The topaz dragon Iltharagh (who dwelt near the mouth of the 
Iceflow) fought several vicious territorial battles with Arveiaturace in
 the skies over the city of Luskan -- inconclusive struggles in which 
both dragons were badly wounded and had to retire to their lairs for 
long periods of recuperation. Since Iltharagh's recent conversion to a 
dracolich (assisted by the Cult of the Dragon, who provided the dragon 
with steady food, lair-guards, and worshipers), however, the former 
topaz male hasn't bothered to defend any territory of its own.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Arveiaturace</b></p>
<p class="size2">Humans are the favorite prey of the White Wyrm, and she
 spends most of each day hunting over the waves, plucking meals from the
 decks of ships and using her wings to flip over vessels that menace her
 with ballistae, fiery missiles, or spells. She drinks from freshwater 
cascades and lakes in the mountains of Ruathym, on Gundarlun, and on 
northern Alaron and the Korinn Archipelago. When on these long hunting 
forays, Arveiaturace has been known to curl up and rest atop heights on 
Barth (tallest crag of the midsea islets known as "the Teeth"), Tonter 
(the most seaward of The Singing Rocks), Ulduth (the more southerly of 
the two seabird-haunted Weed Rocks due south of Carcathen and west of 
the Sea Tower of Nemesser), and even on Sunset (in the Moonshae Isles) 
and on Mintarn itself. This last resting perch led to her 
not-quite-friendship with the shipwright Aldon, but it is a spot she 
rarely dares to frequent today (what with Zhentarim wizards forced west 
by the fall of Zhentil Keep, sorcerers fled from the turmoil of Tethyr, 
and outlawed mages from all over the Sword Coast lands fetching up in 
Mintarn).</p>
<p class="size2">When she's not hunting for food or ships that might 
hold gems, Arveiaturace stays at home, brooding over what Meltharond 
left behind. She finds entertainment in outwitting and devouring 
adventurers and in defending her territory against dragons that dare to 
dispute her authority. She allows young dragons to dwell unmolested at 
Dragonhome in the Moonshaes and several places in the Nelanther within 
her territory, so long as they obey her whenever she issues commands to 
them; she'll tear them apart on the spot if they defy her. Her 
loneliness drives her to journey inland when Arauthator calls or 
whenever wizards use magic to contact her, for she hopes that one of 
them will have the skills to bring Meltharond back from the dead. 
Adventurers planning to lure Iceclaws to her doom are warned that she 
expects treachery to await her on such trips, and she brings along magic
 items she can wield as well as her full measure of cunning. It is 
Elminster's firm belief that Arveiaturace regularly uses a crystal ball 
or other scrying device in her lair to observe weather and shipping, and
 to scout ahead at her summoner whenever she's called upon by anyone.</p>
<p class="size2">Besides her raid on Candlekeep and countless merchant 
ships, and her aerial battles with the elves of Evermeet, the Flying 
Hunt of Nimbral, and others, Arveiaturace is famous for tearing apart a 
midair <i>portal</i> to other planes that opened uncomfortably close to 
her lair and disgorged some sort of flying ship and an aerial guard of 
no less than twelve young adult black dragons! The White Wyrm screamed a
 challenge and charged to the attack, destroying the ship, the gate, and
 every last dragon in a wild fray that lasted for most of a day -- 
despite the hostile and quite spectacular spells of several wizards 
aboard the ship. Those accounts come from no lesser sources than Khelben
 Arunsun of Waterdeep, Alustriel of Silverymoon, and several senior 
mages in the service of other members of the Lords' Alliance -- who were
 all called upon by an awed agent-wizard of the Alliance aboard the Lady
 of the Waves caravel out of Waterdeep.</p>
<p class="size2">Arveiaturace isn't known to have any special bonds 
with, or hatreds of, any individuals or species beyond the 
aforementioned relationships. She shows no signs of being interested in 
closer contact with the dragons or other inhabitants of Faerûn, save 
wizards who can bring her beloved Meltharond back to her.</p>
<p class="size2">In recent seasons, her hunts have grown bolder, 
particularly along the coast of Tethyr. Strife and gathered power seems 
to attract her, and word has spread along the Sword Coast that the Cult 
of the Dragon is becoming very interested in converting her to the Scaly
 Way. At the very least they would like to eliminate her and place 
another dracolich in her lair at Icepeak. It is not known if 
Arveiaturace is aware of this rumor.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Arveiaturace's Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">The White Wyrm seems to heal quickly and enjoy vibrant 
health and strength; it is unlikely that disease will claim her. 
Misadventure is always a peril, and Arveiaturace's lonely existence 
could end abruptly at any time, if she loses her latest battle. The Cult
 of the Dragon seems to be the greatest threat to her future. In 
addition, there are constant mutterings in Evermeet about ways to 
eliminate her, and young, ambitious elves may just mount a successful 
attempt one of these days.</p>
<p class="size2">On the other hand, Arveiaturace could become the 
scourge of the Sword Coast, invigorated anew, if someone returned 
Meltharond Thone to life or unlife. She could also, if Thone regained 
control over her and desired it so, become a messenger and a potent 
controlled fighting force, of much less danger to civilized folk than 
she is at present. In this potential, she is unique among currently 
powerful dragons of the North.</p>
<p class="size2">For the nonce, Arveiaturace's sad life remains an 
inspiration to minstrels up and down the Sword Coast -- and the bane of 
all sailors. "The White Wyrm came calling" has recently become a popular
 euphemism for the death of a sailor, whatever the cause.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b><i></i>Arveiaturace can 
breathe a 50-foot cone of cold every 1d4 rounds; damage 10d6 (cold). A 
breath weapon attack allows a Reflex save (DC 31) for half damage. 
Arveiaturace is immune to her own breath weapon.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes 
effect automatically. It affects only opponents with fewer hit dice or 
levels than Arveiaturace has. The affected creature must make a 
successful Will save (DC 27) or become shaken. Success indicates that 
the target is immune to Arveiaturace's frightful presence for one day. 
On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 
rounds. Those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. On a 
success, the creature is immune to Arveiaturace's fear effect for one 
day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-like Abilities (Sp):</b><i></i>3/day--<i>fog cloud, freezing fog, gust of wind, wall of ice; </i>save DC 12 + spell level; cast as a 10th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Cold Subtype:</b> Immune to cold damage; takes 
double damage from fire unless a saving throw for half damage is 
allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and double 
damage on a failure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dragon Traits:</b><i></i>Immune to sleep and paralysis effects; darkvision 60 ft.; low-light vision.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Freezing Fog (Sp):</b> This ability is similar to a 
solid fog spell but also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any 
surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a <i>grease</i> spell. Arveiaturace is immune to the <i>grease</i> effect because of her icewalking ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Icewalking (Ex):</b><i></i>This ability works like the <i>spider climb </i>spell, but the surfaces Arveiaturace climbs must be icy. It is always in effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses:</b><i></i>Arveiaturace sees four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Sorcerer Spells Known:</i> (6/7/7/6/4; base DC = 12 + spell level): 0 -- <i>detect magic, mage hand, mending, open/close, prestidigitation, ray of frost, read magic, resistance; </i>1st -- <i>alarm, expeditious retreat, Kaupaer's skittish nerves </i>(see <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>)<i>, obscuring mist, shield; </i>2nd -- <i>eagle's splendor</i> (see <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>),<i> endurance, resist elements, see invisibility; </i>3rd -- <i>analyze portal</i> (see <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>)<i>, dispel magic, sleet storm; </i>4th -- <i>Tirumael's energy spheres </i>(see <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>),<i> wall of ice.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i> Suits of armor, coins, gems 
(including a couple of diamonds), weapons, and other things that look 
important or valuable worth approximately 3,600 gp, half a dozen of 
Meltharond's spellbooks (contents to be determined by the DM),<i> crystal ball</i>, <i>ring of spell triggering</i>, and a <i>wand of unseen servant</i>
 (750 gp). At the DM's discretion, the lair could hold the following 
specific item should he or she set up traps and other encounters that 
use the treasure guidelines in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>: <i>ring of spell turning</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Languages:</i> Common, Draconic, Illuskan.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Arveiaturace's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">Little is known of the magic Meltharond Thone cast upon
 the White Wyrm or made available to her, beyond this one (highly useful
 to all creatures lacking human-like hands) spell:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Awaken from Afar<br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5, Clr 6, Drd 6<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One spell trigger activation item<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">An <i>awaken from afar</i> spell allows you to use a 
spell trigger item without actually touching the item. The item to be 
activated must be within the range of the <i>awaken from afar</i> spell,
 and it functions as though you yourself were triggering it from its 
current position. All other conditions, such as the requirement that you
 have the spell on your spell list or if the item's enchantment 
restricts its use to a particular race or individual, still apply. Both 
you and the item to be activated have to be on the same plane. The item 
cannot be in the possession of another creature at the time of 
activation, and it must be an item that you have previously triggered 
normally (in other words, without the aid of an <i>awaken from afar</i> spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>New Magic Items</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Ring of Spell Triggering:</b> This ring allows the wearer to continually utilize the effects of the spell <i>awaken from afar</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 9th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Forge Ring, <i>awaken from afar</i>; <i>Market Price</i>: 90,000 gp.</p>

<p class="size2">Ed Greenwood's <i>Wyrms of the North</i> column ran from <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine 230</i> through <i>259</i>, detailing over two dozen unique dragons of Faerûn. Although written for 2nd edition <b>AD&amp;D</b>,
 the original articles largely eschewed game statistics in favor of 
descriptive text, with the exception of the occasional spell or magic
