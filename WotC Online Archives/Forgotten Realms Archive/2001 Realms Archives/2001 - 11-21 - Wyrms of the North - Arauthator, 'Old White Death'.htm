 the efforts of the intrepid explorer Volothamp Geddarm (more widely 
known across Faerûn, perhaps, as "that serpent-spitting rogue Volo!"), 
an incomplete but nonetheless useful survey of currently active dragon 
rulers in the Sword Coast North region has been compiled, printed, and 
energetically sold in chapbook form on the streets of Waterdeep, 
Neverwinter, and Silverymoon. One copy fell into the hands of Elminster 
of Shadowdale, and after many a snort and head-shaking over it, he was 
persuaded to render it into English (repairing its execrable grammar 
along the way), append some <b>D&amp;D</b> game-specific information, 
and remove certain statements ("to give the wyrmkin a fighting chance," 
the Old Mage was overheard to say) so as to arrive at the words you'll 
read hereafter. Adventurers take note: Volo's work didn't list all 
active dragons of the North, it lists only those who've risen to hold a 
territory known and respected by other dragons. Dracoliches and dead 
wyrms, however famous, were omitted. Otherwise, Volo would've been old 
indeed before his wagon-sized chapbook saw print -- and any issue of <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i> reprinting a respectable portion of it would fill a man-length bookshelf all by itself!</p>
<p class="size2"> Alphabetically, the first great dragon of the 
present-day North is Arauthator, "the icy claws that wait at the cold 
end of the world."<b><a href="#1">1</a></b> This old white dragon is 
famous for his great size and savagery. For almost a century he has 
defended his dominion against many ambitious dragons, slaughtering over a
 score of his own offspring in the process. "Old White Death," as the 
miners and foresters of the North know him, is clearly more intelligent 
than most white dragons. He uses traps and spells to hamper foes in 
battle and to strike intruding dragons from a superior position, rather 
than employing the more prevalent 
"rush-headlong-into-revenge-whatever-the-cost" behavior of his kind. 
Arauthator is larger than most white dragons but adept at silent gliding
 and stealthy movement. He has been known to cause rockfalls and even to
 tear up and drop boulders -- not just on the heads of intruding orcs or
 humans, but also to create barriers to seal up rothé and other large 
alpine beasts inside mountain valleys so that he can dine upon them at 
leisure.</p>
<p class="size2">Old White Death patrols his domain tirelessly, keeping 
careful watch over even the most minor changes. He adjusts his own 
habits to avoid both the traps of foes and the careless overfeeding that
 might lead to the disappearance of a species on which he likes to dine.
 In the process, he has smashed at least one community of frost giants 
(Bulindiful, a cavern-catacomb fortress set in the heart of Mount 
Halaragh, just west of the mines of Mirabar in the Spine of the World 
mountain range), and he has torn apart a mountain peak (Sardin's Sword, 
once a lookout over the upper Surbrin) to destroy the bugbear hold 
inside it.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator is far more cunning and patient than most 
white dragons. "The spark of revenge still kindles the fire that warms 
his heart to carry him on through the centuries," wrote the sage 
Amorthas of Ruathym,<b><a href="#2">2</a></b> "but he lets it smolder 
under dampers of patience and cold calculation, where other whitewings 
[white dragons] would leap to the attack." No one knows why Arauthator 
is this way, but it's clear that the old dragon uses this patience to 
anticipate and prepare for attacks from rival dragons, rising orc 
hordes, and the remorhaz who roam the Endless Ice Sea. He also bides his
 time to develop new personal-warning spells that alert him of 
approaching dragons and magic items.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator is a skilled mimic and can speak the Common 
tongue well enough to pose as a lost miner or injured prospector. He has
 long practice in concealing himself under snow by flapping his wings as
 he burrows into drifts so as to lift the snow, which then falls over 
him again in a pristine blanket. Arauthator often dozes when sleeping in
 snow, but he never sleeps through the approach of danger (he can smell 
most beasts, including humans, for a mile or more downwind). He has 
mastered the patience needed to remain still for days on end, perched on
 a mountainside or lying in the snow of a bowl-shaped mountain valley. 
Prey and foes often don't notice him until far too late.</p>
<p class="size2">Old White Death holds his own survival as his highest 
goal, but he is far less lazy than most dragons in pursuing it. He 
regards the maintenance of his dominion as crucial to his own strength, 
though he has chosen not to strike at the creatures of lcewind Dale. 
This abstinence may be born of habit; the region was formerly part of 
the territory of the dragon known to humans as Icingdeath, and the two 
dragons came to an uneasy truce, ignoring each other and leaving each 
other's territories alone, rather than destroying each other in a battle
 for rule over the Reghed Glacier. Instead, Arauthator concentrates on 
carving ever-deeper tunnels into the Endless Ice Sea and the rock 
beneath, devouring all subterranean creatures he finds (chiefly gnomes),
 to unearth his own gem and mineral treasure, and protect his realm 
against attack from below by exterminating all possible attackers. These
 forays seem to attract remorhaz from the vast glacial areas that lie 
north of the Spine of the World, and Arauthator fights an ongoing battle
 against the iceworms, devouring all of the remorhaz he defeats. 
Northern giants and gnomes refer to these delvings as the Dragonholes 
and report that they consist of at least six separate tunnel complexes 
spread over a wide area north of the dragon's lair. Several observers 
have also mentioned that the dragon takes pleasure in slaying remorhaz, 
often hurling the monsters around like rag dolls before killing them, or
 folding his wings and wriggling across the ice to meet and fight them 
worm to worm.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Arauthator's Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator lairs in the Lonefang, a prow-shaped 
mountain that rises out of the Endless Ice Sea several hundred miles due
 north of Mithril Hall. Intrepid adventurers report that it can be seen 
on the horizon by those who reach the frigid, wind-clawed northern faces
 of the Spine of the World mountains. Although Arauthator's home is 
thought to have a subterranean back entrance through glacial rifts many 
miles to the northwest (near the row of rock pinnacles known as the 
Worldwyrm's Teeth), the mountain itself has only one visible entrance: a
 vast shaft that cuts into the descending northern slope from above and 
plunges down to a cavern filled by a frozen lake. Here Arauthator hurls 
most of his spells at intruders seeking to reach the network of caverns 
at the far end of the lake, where he dwells.</p>
<p class="size2">The lair proper is known to include a bonepit; a cavern
 crammed with chunks of metallic ores; a cluttered central feeding and 
working cave that is home to some captured magical items; and an ancient
 iron structure that Old White Death uses as a prison for humans and 
smaller creatures he intends to devour later. According to an escaped 
prisoner, his cage, a curious cylindrical enclosure divided into several
 internal chambers, looks very much like some of the gnomish craft built
 to sail the skies from crystal sphere to sphere.</p>
<p class="size2">A rising, trap-lined tunnel leads to a descending 
series of ice-walled storage caverns, each opening into the next in a 
frozen waterfall of gems that Arauthator occasionally rolls around in, 
purring in catlike bliss. Lying on his accustomed bed of diamonds in the
 last, lowest cavern, the dragon can look up through all of the 
hoard-caverns. He customarily reaches that bed by slithering down the 
river of gems, chuckling in contentment. A vertical shaft large enough 
to permit proper flight allows the old dragon fast ascent from the 
bottom of this cavern to a ledge overhanging the trap-lined approach 
tunnel. To soar up the entrance shaft and leave, Arauthator customarily 
takes wing from the ledge and glides down the tunnel and out over the 
frozen lake before beating his wings in a mighty rush. No servants serve
 Arauthator in his lair.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Arauthator's Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">From the Lonefang, Arauthator holds sway over a 
dominion that stretches from the Cold Run in the west (although he 
doesn't feed on the inhabitants of Icewind Dale, he has several times 
slain dragons who tried to raid or settle there) to Mount Caumarath in 
the east (the huge peak at the northern end of the Ice Mountains, 
northwest of Citadel Adbar). The northern boundary of this dragon's 
domain is unknown to scholars and others, but the southern extent of 
Arauthator's rule is marked by the Spine of the World range as far east 
as the Fell Pass, where the boundary swings south and east in a great 
arc to take in all the land north of Mithril Hall and the Citadel of 
Many Arrows. All creatures in this vast, rocky wilderland (the 
headwaters of the River Surbrin) exist at Arauthator's pleasure, unless 
they keep to the Moonwood or the Coldwood, for the white dragon never 
hunts prey in the trees. With the rise of civilization centered at 
Silverymoon, the supremacy of Arauthator's rule over this more southerly
 area may soon be tested.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> The Deeds of Arauthator</b></p>
<p class="size2">The favorite prey of Old White Death is full-grown 
frost giants (rarely available these days), followed closely by remorhaz
 and northern deer. Rothé and various bear species are next on the menu,
 and other dragons are also favored fare. Arauthator is less fond of the
 flesh of orcs, bugbears, and other goblinkin, but such creatures make 
up much of his staple diet; without the dragon's presence, the frequency
 and numbers of orc hordes sweeping down through the Sword Coast North 
would no doubt be much greater.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator is known to use an <i>icemelt</i> spell both
 in his glacial delvings and to transform frozen lakes into temporary 
watering holes. He is careful never to feed or drink in a pattern that 
foes could observe and exploit. The dragon usually makes one long patrol
 of a part of his domain every day, plus a shorter, similar foray. He 
usually feeds at least once a day, upon sighting suitable prey during 
the longer patrol. He may sleep atop a rocky height if tiring when far 
afield (once, boldly, atop Berun's Hill, in the territory of the green 
dragon Claugiyliamatar), but he prefers to sleep on his bed of gems in 
the Lonefang. On rare occasions he keeps to his lair for three days or 
more, perfecting a new spell.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator employs a wide array of detection and trap 
spells (most of the latter being cold-based) and wields spells effective
 against other dragons (such as <i>wingbind</i><b><a href="#3">3</a></b>),
 and to enjoy freewheeling aerial clawing and raking battles rather than
 dodging among mountain peaks and sniping with his spells. Arauthator is
 famous for tearing apart the venerable red dragon Rathalylaug high 
above the rooftops of Neverwinter in the Year of the Grimoire (1324 DR),
 in a spectacular battle at sunset. The white dragon dove down to smash 
apart a tower in triumph. He happened to choose the tower of the 
sorceress Shareera, who was smashed amid the toppling stones, even as 
the blood of the dying Rathalylaug -- and his last, vain <i>firetrail</i> spell<b><a href="#4">4</a></b> -- rained down on the city. Wizards also remember Arauthator for freezing the mage Phaurothlin of the Arcane Brotherhood<b><a href="#5">5</a></b>
 solid, then shattering the helpless sorcerer against a mountainside. It
 seems that the haughty mage made the mistake of challenging the white 
dragon for ownership of a spellbook unearthed from the ice-covered grave
 of a Netherese wizard during mining north of Mirabar.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator has a dozen or more grimoires hidden in his 
lair and also works away patiently at mastering all the spells in them. 
He has obviously transcended the traditional spell-handling limitations 
of white dragons that keep their verbal-only adaptations to wizard 
spells of the first level -- but his personal limits are as yet unknown.
 Old White Death also impressed watching wizards at the MageFair held on
 the western verges of Var the Golden several decades ago, by the ease 
with which he shouldered the blue wyrm Eltagrathuuloor into the side of 
Mount Gundar (the source of the River Gundar). The blow was powerful 
enough to cause a rockfall that brought most of the top of that peak 
down on his rival, burying Eltagrathuuloor alive.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator regards the white dragon Arveiaturace as an 
acceptable mate when he feels inclined. He employs a sending spell to 
call her to his lair for dalliance, giving her gems from his hoard after
 each mating but firmly escorting her out of his domain to rear any 
hatchlings that may result on her own. In the past, he has mated with 
the gigantic white dragon Ghaulantatra, the "Old Mother Wyrm" worshiped 
by some orc tribes as a goddess. Arauthator exhibited no remorse when 
the beholder Thaluul destroyed Ghaulantatra and claimed her lair 
(somewhere in the mountains north of High Gap, between the Delimbiyr and
 the Fallen Lands).</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator's love of a good fight has made him 
respected -- and avoided -- by other dragons. Only ambitious, 
overconfident younglings seek to defeat him, finding instead their own 
deaths. Arauthator makes no alliances and ignores the overtures of other
 dragons. He lusts after treasure of his own finding and magic of his 
own creation, and he can't be lured out of his domain by promises of 
gems or magic. The prospect of a good fight with another dragon always 
interests him, but he's too wise to leave the lands he knows so well 
just to do battle, since true foes always come to him eventually. He's 
too patient and calculating to be governed by hatreds, and he even seems
 to admire capable or wily foes. Old White Death has saluted adventuring
 bands he could easily have slain, after witnessing a clever ruse or 
bold stratagem on their part.</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator seems especially busy these days developing 
new magics and seeking wizards' tombs within his domain to increase his 
personal magical might. He also seems wary of intrusions into his 
territory. Elminster is of the opinion that the old dragon may have 
witnessed the opening of a gate from another plane and been horrified at
 the realization of how easily unknown foes with powerful magic can 
penetrate his lair without warning.</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Arauthator's Fate </b></p>
<p class="size2">It's likely Old White Death will die violently, but 
he's begun to seem ageless and certainly too wily to be slain easily by 
any rival dragon. It's rumored he's taken to hiring certain adventurers,
 via sendings, to retrieve the hoards of dragons he has slain, rather 
than leaving his domain to seize them himself. This seemingly prudent 
practice may offer a foe the chance to introduce harmful (perhaps 
explosive) magic into the treasure taken to Arauthator -- and certainly 
treacherous adventurers could use their mission to get closer to Old 
White Death than most humans could ever hope to do before launching an 
attack.</p>

Reflex save for half damage with a DC of 29. He is immune to his own 
breath weapon unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes 
effect automatically. It affects only opponents with fewer hit dice or 
levels than the creature has. The affected creature must make a 
successful Will save of 26 or become shaken. Success indicates that the 
target is immune to Arauthator's frightful presence for one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-like Abilities (Sp):</b> 3/day--<i>gust of wind, fog cloud, wall of ice; </i>1/day--<i>control weather; </i>all as Sor8; save DC 12 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> Arauthator maneuvers and fights
 by using nonvisual senses (smell). Invisibility and darkness are 
irrelevant, though he still can't discern ethereal beings. (240 ft.). 
Arauthator usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice
 creatures within range of his blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Cold Subtype: </b>Immune to cold damage; takes 
double damage from fire unless a saving throw for half damage is 
allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and double 
damage on a failure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dragon Traits:</b> Immune to sleep and paralysis effects; darkvision 60 ft.; low-light vision.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Freezing Fog (Sp):</b></i>This ability is similar to a <i>solid fog</i> spell but also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a <i>grease</i> spell. Arauthator is immune to the <i>grease</i> effect because of his icewalking ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Icewalking (Ex): </b>This ability works like the <i>spider climb</i> spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. It is always in effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Keen Senses: </b>Arauthator sees four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Spells Known:</i> (6/7/7/6/5/3; base DC = 12 + spell level): 0 -- <i>arcane mark, detect magic, detect poison, mage hand, open/close, prestidigitation, ray of frost, read magic, resistance;</i> 1st -- <i>alarm, detect secret doors, identify, know protections, ventriloquism; </i>2nd -- <i>detect thoughts, icemelt, invisibility, magic mouth;</i> 3rd -- <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, fireball, water breathing;</i> 4th -- <i>frost vortex, wingbird; </i>5th -- <i>sending. </i></p>

<p class="size2"><b> Arauthator's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2"> Old White Death commands a respectable roster of 
detection, entrapment, and combat spells, with many of them being 
variants of well-known wizard spells. He has also demonstrably developed
 magical means of triggering captured wands from afar, so that he can 
fire them at intruders in his lair without touching them directly. It 
must be stressed that human knowledge of Arauthator's magic is 
dangerously incomplete. Thanks to long and diligent observations by 
Felandaert the Farscrying of Candlekeep, however, we now have specifics 
of three of the dragon's spells:</p>
<p class="size2">Arauthator uses <i>frost vortex</i> both in combat and 
as a trap, leaving its waiting motes in tempting alcoves and blind 
passages in the walls of his lair. He uses <i>icemelt</i> primarily to 
dig tunnels through glacial ice in his search for treasure, but at least
 once used it to flood orcs out of subterranean tunnels by tapping a 
meltwater river under a glacier. (The spell temporarily prevented the 
exposed water from freezing.) Arauthator uses <i>wingbind</i>, a spell known to a small number of dragons, in freewheeling aerial clawing and raking battles with other dragons.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frost Vortex</b><br> Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. plus 10 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> One tiny dustflake (see below)<br><b>Duration:</b> Permanent until discharged<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex (half) and Fortitude (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You create a tiny dustflake that either races towards a
 target creature or hangs motionless in a chosen spot, as you choose. In
 the former case, you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to hit your 
target, but if you fail, it hangs motionless near your target. This 
spell is triggered whenever any living creature passes within 5 feet of 
the dustflake.</p>
<p class="size2">When this occurs, the spell takes effect. The air in a 
20-foot radius sphere around the dustflake whirls violently about with a
 harsh hissing noise, then grows very cold, coating all solid objects 
within it with thick frost. The frost inflicts 1d4 points of cold damage
 per caster level (maximum 10d4) to all creatures within the area. 
Unattended objects also take this damage. Creatures that fail their 
Reflex save also suffer from the effects of a <i>slow</i> spell for 1d4 
rounds. Once activated, the frost vortex is gone within the round, 
leaving no moisture, ice, nor rushing of air behind.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Icemelt</b><br> Transmutation<b><br> Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 2 <br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action <br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. plus 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> 10-ft. square/level (see text)<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous/2d4 hours<br><b>Saving Throw: </b>None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">This spell causes solid, nonmagical ice to vaporize, 
dissipating into the surrounding atmosphere without fog, water runoff, 
or heat. You affect a 10-foot-square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet; you
 can orient it vertically to ablate a wall-like structure. Natural and 
magical ice cannot form in the affected area for 2d4 hours thereafter. 
Ice within an organic mass (such as a frozen body) is unaffected by this
 spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wingbind<br></b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One winged creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will half<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">The subject's wings become paralyzed. The subject 
cannot use its wings to fly, swim, attack, or anything else requiring 
movement. If the creature is currently flying, it falls and suffers 
normal falling damage.</p>
<p class="size2"> If the creature succeeds at its saving throw against 
this spell, its wings are only partially paralyzed. Its fly speed is 
reduced to one-half and its fly maneuverability drops by one category. 
If it uses its wings to swim, its swim speed is reduced as well. Attacks
 with the wings have a -2 circumstance penalty.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Arcane Focus:</i> A pair of iron nails.</p>
