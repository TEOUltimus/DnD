 kept to the letter of her bond, even after her body rotted and fell 
apart. The spells that bound her animated her still, keeping her 
sentient . . . if not entirely sane. </span></i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 he read Volo's notes (a confused cluster of speculatives surrounding 
little more than a correct name and gender) Elminster nodded, summoned a
 quill and fresh parchment from some handy otherwhere, and started 
writing. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Volo's
 sketchy notes came as no surprise to the Old Mage, because very few 
folk alive in Faerûn have even heard of Miirym. Though this statement 
has become a trite truism overused by taletellers describing dragons, 
the reason for her obscurity is indeed that "most who encounter her 
don't live to speak of it later." </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Long,
 long ago, Miirym was a silver dragon who dwelt near Candlekeep. In her 
playful hunting, she devoured several scholars and destroyed a score or 
so irreplaceable books on their way to the abbey, so a mage attached to 
the abbey bound her to service: She was to defend the monks, buildings, 
and books of the abbey for some twenty years. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Unfortunately
 for Miirym, the spellcaster was the archsorcerer Torth, whose spells 
were so mighty that when he died -- fifteen years along in Miirym's 
sentence of twenty -- no one could break the bindings. The monks 
apologetically wrote up a tome describing the situation and all that was
 known of Torth's spells, then set a copy of it in a crypt beneath the 
keep, in a casket with the sorcerer's bones and staff. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym
 was a captive in servitude. Though she kept to the letter of her bond, 
her attacks on transgressors became savage. This is how Candlekeep 
acquired its reputation of utter impregnability and that to attempt to 
steal from it or slip into it unnoticed was futile. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eventually
 worn out by advanced age and the attacks of foolish would-be intruders 
-- notably several bands of Calishite wizards, who planned and then 
tried to carry out elaborate spell attacks on Candlekeep in the Year of 
the Shieldtree (1181 DR) and the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR) -- Miirym 
"died." That is, her body rotted and fell apart, losing flesh before 
bones, and then bone after bone crumbled away to dust, while the spells 
that bound her animated her still, keeping her sentient . . . if not 
entirely sane. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 all that remained of the Sentinel Wyrm was a malevolent but diligent 
invisible guardian force, the monks of Candlekeep, fearing for the 
safety of legitimate visitors to the abbey, hired mages to destroy their
 strange guardian. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even
 these wizards could not prevail against Torth's cunningly woven spells 
(so linked that the destruction of one serves to strengthen the next, 
and spawn an eventual regeneration of all destroyed magics), and 
succeeded only in "driving down" Miirym to a radius of perhaps a quarter
 of a mile from the remains of Torth. A sacrificial band of monks 
undertook to carry the archsorcerer's casket deeper into the cellars and
 natural (volcanic) passages beneath them. Where the last of this band 
fell, Torth's casket rests, at the heart of a labyrinthine complex of 
caverns and passages beneath Candlekeep -- and Miirym still lurks there,
 under the keep, defending it very effectively against intrusion from 
below. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">According to Elminster, Miirym exists today as a pair of spectral jaws that can cast <i>dimension door</i>
 at will. She still has a vicious bite, her spells, and the ability to 
use many breath weapons. Miirym defends Candlekeep diligently, but she'd
 rather talk than fight, and she will trade tales for information about 
current events in Faerûn. She is very lonely and secretly dreams of 
regaining her body and flying high and free over all of Toril. 
Adventurers seeking to seduce her aid or favor by promising such things 
are warned that it has been tried several times before, and so bitter 
were Miirym's disappointments that she is cynical about any promises to 
aid her in her dream -- though she never tires of talking about it. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 life, Miirym loved green, growing things. In her mind's eye, she can 
still vividly picture (and identify) many plants, the Sword Coast 
topography between Amn and Waterdeep (about as far inland as the western
 edge of the High Moor) as it was fifteen hundred years ago, and the 
fierce lightning storms she used to love to fly through. She likes to 
hear jokes but is saddened by news of changes and daily doings in Faerûn
 she can't see or be a part of. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym's
 sanity isn't strong. Although she'll never forget the situation she's 
in and the identities and locations of potential foes or would-be 
intruders into Candlekeep, anyone who tries to trick her or launch a 
sneak attack can expect to have her come screaming and howling after 
them, hurling everything she can in a savage, furious attack.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">She
 tore one book thief to shreds with her jaws and often shows his 
resting-place to parties of intruders as a warning: a narrow passage 
littered with forels, bloodstains, and small dust-heaps that were once 
small scraps of flesh and bone; nothing larger than the size of a man's 
fist was left of the thief when the dragon was finished. The books 
themselves are missing. (Miirym carefully put them atop Torth's casket, 
and a daring priest of Candlekeep magically snatched them back to the 
keep; the Sentinel Wyrm suspects that this was their fate, but she is 
haunted by the possibility that a force or being she failed to detect 
somehow reached the books and spirited them away.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 intruders who come within Miirym's reach are openly carrying books of 
any kind (such as their own spellbooks), or reveal such items to her at 
any time, the Sentinel Wyrm insists that they be surrendered to her for 
"rightful return" to Candlekeep. She won't believe any protests as to 
the ownership of the tomes; as far as she's concerned, writings of any 
sort belong to Candlekeep, period. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">She
 has one further grisly warning to share with intruders: in a dead-end 
passage, a skeletal head and shoulders floats in midair, arms frozen 
forever raised in futile warding-off gestures, jaw stretched wide in an 
endless scream. The rest of the skeleton has long since crumbled away; 
this much remains due to the failing magics of a plain electrum carcanet
 still encircling the bony neck. Its magics fail entirely if it is 
disturbed, allowing both it and the remaining bones to crumble into 
dust. In any case, its power long ago rendered the bones inert to 
scrying and necromantic magics; nothing of the identity or intentions of
 the remains can now be learned. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym
 willingly supplies all she knows: This was once a beautiful and 
imperious sorcerer who tried to bargain with the Sentinel Wyrm, offering
 to surrender a book she'd seized if she were allowed to copy certain 
writings out of it, unmolested. When the dragon told her both the tome 
and the new writing would have to be returned to the keep, the mage 
hurled a <i>meteor swarm</i> at Miirym -- but she had the misfortune to do so in a section of passage where an earlier intruder had left a <i>glass guardian</i>
 (defined below), so she felt its full effects herself. (Several of 
these items still survive elsewhere in the passages roamed by the 
Sentinel Wyrm.) Staggering and near death, she retreated to where her 
remains now float and cast her last powerful spell at Miirym as the 
floating jaws approached her in slow silence. It was <i>imprisonment</i>,
 and it had no effect on the Sentinel Wyrm because of her spell 
resistance. The sorceress gave in to despair but refused to surrender 
the books when Miirym asked her one last time -- so the Sentinel Wyrm 
ate both of her legs. The carcanet held the mage upright as she bled to 
death. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There's
 little else of interest in the passages within the Sentinel Wyrm's 
reach, beyond one seeping spring of drinkable water and the 
aforementioned scattering of <i>glass guardians</i>; would-be intruders 
are warned that Miirym knows every bend and fissure of her "domain" 
intimately and always knows precisely where she is, and whether anything
 has changed. (In other words, if an intruder uses magic to appear made 
of stone and hugs a wall, the Sentinel Wyrm knows that this or that lump
 "isn't supposed to be there" and confronts it as a disguised intruder.)
 </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Miirym's Lair </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Sentinel Wyrm hasn't been back to her lair in a little over fifteen 
hundred years -- and in that time, it has disappeared, sliding into the 
sea in 788 DR, when the "sea stack" it was located atop collapsed under 
the tireless pounding of the waves. The pillar of rock had been 
separated from the shore before Miirym (one of a large family of silver 
dragons who ranged across the comparatively dragonless North of the 
time, to find their own lairs sometime circa 2 DR) ever found it. It 
stood like a lone dark pillar just offshore from Ulgoth's Beard (which, 
of course, didn't exist then). Many rocks and islets can still be found 
in the vicinity today, left behind by a receding shore -- despite the 
silt brought downstream by the adjacent river, onshore waves scour the 
coast here and wear it away, year by year. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym's
 stack stood well out to sea from where the shore is today, but it has 
been reduced to fist-sized rubble and gravel by the Sea of Swords since 
its destruction, and her paltry treasure hoard (coins and silver 
tradebars, no magic) drowned and lost. The lair itself was no more than a
 long, twisting cave of natural origin, and served as a home to a mated 
pair of wyverns until Miirym arrived, was attacked, and slew them. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Miirym's Domain </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym
 once roamed the rolling, forested coastal lands between the High Moor 
and the Sea of Swords (as far offshore as Mintarn), south as far as the 
Cloud Peaks, and north to Mount Helimbrar. This was so long ago that 
dragons who now dwell in or near her onetime domain don't know of her 
existence -- and in the unlikely event she were to emerge into the 
surface world today and desire to rule over a territory, Miirym would 
have to fight for, and win, her domain all over again. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Miirym </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym
 spends her endless days wandering all of the passages within her reach,
 idly widening connecting tunnels and enlarging rooms by casting the few
 rock-shattering and matter-teleporting spells available to her. She 
always enjoys a chat, and from time to time an especially bad monk of 
Candlekeep is sent down to talk to her as an especially cruel 
punishment; marks on the passage walls clearly show how far they can 
travel and still remain just out of reach of her spells and jaws. She'll
 always challenge and try to talk to intruders before attacking them -- 
and if they offer her violence at first sight, she'll try to converse 
while battling them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Sentinel Wyrm isn't above lurking near intruders, silent and as hidden 
as possible, and eavesdropping to learn all she can about them (and 
whatever they may be talking about), before first revealing herself -- 
or after intruders think they've escaped her. </span></p>

 Whenever Miirym attacks, charges, or flies overhead, every creature

(DC 40). On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD becomes panicked 
for 4d6 rounds and one with 5 or more HD becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. 
Success indicates that the target is immune to Miirym's frightful

 Miirym can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better 
magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. 
She is immune to all nonmagical attack forms; 50% chance to ignore any 
damage from a corporeal source (except for force effects, such as magic 
missiles, and attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Miirym can pass 
through solid objects (but not force effects) at will, and her attacks 
ignore natural armor, armor, and shields (though deflection bonuses and 
force effects work normally). She moves silently (cannot be heard with

 If Miirym takes 100 or more points of damage in any 1-hour period (or 
if she is "destroyed" with positive energy from turning damage), she 
disperses, remaining helpless and undetectable (including from location 
spells) for 2d8+8 hours, after which she reappears. She reappears with 
the same number of hit points she had when she was dispersed and 
automatically regains hit points every 24 hours as if she had rested. 
(She can regain hit points normally while dispersed if enough time has 
passed since her last hit point recovery.) If actually brought to 0 hit 
points or otherwise destroyed by a spell effect that bypasses hit points
 (such as undeath to death from <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), she disperses for 3x the normal duration and reforms normally at the end of that time (recovering hp as normal). </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Undead Traits:</b>
 Miirym is immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death,
 effects, necromantic effects, mind-influencing effects, and any effect 
requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. She is not 
subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,
 or energy drain; cannot heal damage if there is no Intelligence score, 
(though fast healing and regeneration work normally). Negative energy 
heals her, and she is not at risk of death from massive damage but is 
destroyed at 0 or fewer hit points (but see restorative dispersion). 
Miirym cannot be raised; resurrection works only if she is willing.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 incorporeal sentinel is created when a magically bound guardian 
outlives its normal lifespan or dies while it is magically bound to 
serve. Essentially, the magic that bound it provides it with a means of 
living on, though the creature may not necessarily care to do so. The 
body of the creature decays over time, and the creature eventually 
becomes completely incorporeal, while its jaws remain the only visible 
(but also incorporeal) remnant of it. Only breaking the binding allows 
it to truly die. Only one example of a creature with this template is 
known -- Miirym.</span></p>

Normally it reappears with the same number of hit points it had when it

regains hit points every 24 hours as if it had rested, and it can regain
 hit points normally while dispersed if enough time has passed since its

otherwise destroyed by a spell effect that bypasses hit points (such as <i>undeath to death</i> from <i>Magic of Faerûn</i>),
 it disperses for 3x the normal duration and reforms normally at the end
 of that time (recovering hp as normal). It is not known what it would 
take to permanently destroy the incorporeal sentinel aside from a means 
to break the binding holding the incorporeal sentinel to existence, 
though some scholars theorize that closely studying the binding and, 
once knowledge of the spell used is gained (Spellcraft check DC 100), 
using a <i>wish</i> spell to break the binding would break the bonds. 
Some scholars believe that having Torth's book can assist the caster 
(+20 bonus on Spellcraft check). These are only theories, however. 
Nobody has yet attempted to break the binding in this manner.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Sentinel Wyrm has passed beyond death and awaits the untwining of 
Torth's mighty spells to grant her freedom. Thereafter, she would be a 
wandering, spectral force, free to do great damage in Faerûn if she 
desired. Azuth knows the means of binding even so powerful a spectral 
sentience into the helve of a magic weapon or other item. Certain 
Netherese liches and senior Red Wizards might also know, or be able to 
devise, such magical processes, but Mystra is unlikely to provide 
guidance to any mages or priests requesting inspiration over such 
matters. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All
 in all, Miirym bids fair to be around the underways of Candlekeep for 
another thousand years or more, in Elminster's estimation. If something 
were to happen to her, he said, one of Mystra's Chosen might even find 
themselves restoring her to her present state, for Mystra and Oghma seem
 to share some secret and solemn agreement as to the sanctity of 
Candlekeep. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym's
 sad fate is best described in a tome written over a hundred years ago 
and, ironically, stored on the shelves of Candlekeep. Throughout the 
book, the writer describes Miirym as "Lonelyjaws." Elminster suggests 
that any similarly lonely Faerûnian who doesn't mind a little danger -- 
and doesn't carry any writing materials -- might cultivate her as a 
friend to talk to. There are worse ways of spending one's time. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Miirym's Magic </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miirym has custody of -- and knows the powers of -- at least seven <i>glass guardian</i> spheres. She moves them to aid her in battle against magically powerful foes if she deems it necessary. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Glass Guardian:</b>
 These small, translucent glass spheres tend to be green, blue, or 
near-colorless mauve in hue. Empty and about the size of a large man's 
fist, they float motionless in midair unless grasped and towed (or 
thrust along by an impact or force) to a new location; when released, 
they hang motionless. A glass guardian has 0 hardness and 2 hit points; 
if destroyed, they fall harmlessly to dust, and their magic is lost. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Their
 sole purpose, however, is to reflect back at its source any spell that 
enters or erupts into being within (or partially within) the 
5-ft.-radius area around them. Unlike the <i>spell turning</i> spell, a <i>glass guardian </i>can affect area spells (but not touch spells).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They
 do this unerringly, darkening and shattering the moment they've 
reflected a single spell. However, they can be clustered in groups to 
provide more lasting protection; only one <i>glass guardian</i> reacts 
to a spell, negating it and falling to dust, leaving nearby guardians 
intact and still operating. Some of these spheres have existed for 
thousands of years; the spells that create them are ancient.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 13th, <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell, <i>spell turning</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 30,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Sentinel Wyrm also wields an impressive array of spells. She had little
 time to devise her own magic before being bound into the service of 
Candlekeep, but from time to time she has gained spells from writings 
brought to her by the monks or that she gleaned from books gained from 
intruders (before they were taken up to the keep proper by the spells of
 monks scrying her). She's had little chance to alter her spells, but a 
few of them are rare enough to warrant inclusion here. </span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 transform the target weapon into a sharp-fanged, smooth-bodied 
serpentine creature that is useless as a weapon and immediately attacks 
the closest creature. Since it is normally used on the drawn weapon of 
an enemy, the weapon usually attacks its wielder. The weapon is treated 
as an animated object of the appropriate size except that it has a speed
 of 5 and it has a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (adjusted
 for Strength). It is not poisonous. If the weapon was magical, all of 
its active properties apply to the animated object, but not abilities 
where a wielder needs to invoke them. For example, a <i>+1 flaming sword</i>
 targeted by this spell retains the normal weapon's hardness, has a +1 
enhancement bonus to attacks and damage with its bite, and deals +1d6 
points of fire damage with its bite. However, if the weapon had the 
ability to cast <i>vampiric touch</i> 3 times per day at the wielder's command, it could not activate this ability in itself.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If cast on a held weapon, the wielder is not compelled to hold it and may drop it on his turn.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 create a 5-foot-radius sphere of opaque cloudy wind. This sphere 
persists for up to 1 round/level, after which it discharges. It also 
discharges if you will it to (a standard action) or a creature other 
than you touches it. When discharged, the sphere explodes in a 20-foot 
burst. The burst duplicates the effects of any breath weapon you may 
employ (chosen at the time of casting), provided that the breath deals 
damage or resembles a spell effect of 6th-level or lower. It does not 
use your breath weapon, or prevent or delay you from using it. Breath 
weapons that deal damage cannot exceed 90 points (the normal limit for 
6th-level arcane spells). The normal saving throw applies for the breath
 weapon, though it uses the spell DC instead of its original DC.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 windy sphere has no effect other than to provide concealment as if it 
were a fog cloud. It does not affect missile weapons (unlike <i>wind wall</i>), knock over or hold at bay creatures (unlike <i>gust of wind</i>) or any other wind- or air-based effects.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Casters
 who do not naturally have breath weapons must research a way to link an
 available spell to this one (usually with a custom spell or metamagic 
feat), otherwise the detonation has no effect.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 spell has the appropriate descriptions for the breath weapon the sphere
 releases. For example, if used to release a fire breath weapon, this 
spell has the fire subtype.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 sphere may be opaque or transparent (noticeable only as a shimmer or 
ripple in the air). It remains in place until triggered, with triggering
 conditions set by the caster in the manner of a <i>magic mouth</i> spell. You never trigger your own <i>breathdoom</i> spell unless you meet the trigger conditions and wish the spell to take effect. Casting one <i>breathdoom</i>
 so that it overlaps an existing one or their blast radiuses would 
overlap causes the first one to dissipate harmlessly. Breath weapons 
that deal damage cannot exceed 120 points when triggered by this spell 
and this spell cannot duplicate breath weapons that have effects greater
 than 8th level.</span></p>
