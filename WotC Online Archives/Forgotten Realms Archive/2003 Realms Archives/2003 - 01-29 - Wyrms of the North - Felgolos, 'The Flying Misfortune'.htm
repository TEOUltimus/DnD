<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2001-29%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Felgolos,%20%27The%20Flying%20Misfortune%27_files/dragon_238_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186">It's
 not often that the famous explorer, mageling, and sometime travel guide
 writer Volo admits to puzzlement about something in the Realms. 
However, Elminster chuckled frequently over the bewildered notations, 
queries, and counter-notations in Volo's entry on Felgolos, a dragon 
known to some sages and long-lived inhabitants of the western Heartlands
 and eastern Amn as "the Flying Misfortune" because of his long career 
of crashing into things, causing mayhem, and appearing in the midst of 
draconic battles, clashes of armies, archmages' spell-duels, and other 
spectacular events.</p>
<p class="size2">Felgolos is a juvenile male bronze dragon of sleek 
build, unshakable curiosity, and unfailing good nature. He refuses to 
make enemies or to be prudent, and he wanders Faer√ªn, intruding on the 
territories of other dragons and venturing into situations of great 
peril (when Dragon Cultists have urged a dracolich into making its first
 raiding flight, for instance, or Zhentarim wizards riding feywings rise
 aloft from Darkhold in great numbers, to mount a spell attack on some 
hapless city or other). Through years of this sort of peering about in 
perpetual wonderment, Felgolos seems to have led a charmed life. 
Although he has often been hurt and even forced to fight or flee in 
earnest many times, he has survived poking his nose into one danger 
after another and continues to blithely do so despite many warnings (and
 threats) as to his fate.</p>
<p class="size2">Born to a pair of magically mighty bronze dragons 
who've since used their Art to travel to other planes (where, 
presumably, they still flourish), Felgolos was taught to experiment, to 
observe, and to play with magic. When other hatchlings were exulting in 
tearing apart their first cattle, Felgolos was tinkering with a 
"pluck-and-grab" teleport spell that could uproot trees and stumps at 
his behest, so that he could make fences around his own stolen herd of 
cattle. When other young dragons were raiding their first villages, 
Felgolos was lying atop crags using spying spells to look around 
villages and learn how these strange creatures called humans and 
half-elves lived. His parents encouraged him to go on independent 
forays. When he wanted to play, they cast spells that linked their three
 minds and then worked magic together.</p>
<p class="size2">This upbringing has given Felgolos three unusual 
qualities: a carefree self-reliance that steers him well clear of the 
treasure-grasping paranoia that afflicts so many dragons, a knowledge 
(matched by few elves and even fewer humans) of everyday life of all 
things on the surface of Faer√ªn, and a mastery of magic far beyond the 
norm for his age (Felgolos is the equivalent of a 14th-level sorcerer, 
instead of the 3rd-level sorcerer typical of most bronze dragons his 
age).</p>
<p class="size2">If he ever turned to evil -- or to any aim or scheme in
 a determined, persistent way -- Felgolos would be a formidable foe. He 
seems incapable of this sort of behavior, however, treating opponents he
 faces again and again as some sort of amusement "laid on" for him -- 
never as enemies to be hated, feared, or slain.</p>
<p class="size2">Instead, Felgolos spends his days wandering aimlessly 
about Faer√ªn, peering at this and that. He stops from time to time to 
feed or whenever he sees something that interests him and trades 
information about what he's seen with folk he meets for other news. 
Felgolos is without guile and never lies outright, though he's often 
cryptic and omits important things for pranksome fun or to protect those
 he considers his friends. Certain hermits, sages, Harpers, and isolated
 mages (from Malchor Harpell to Elminster of Shadowdale) are among his 
favorite hosts; they always have news to impart. Many of these learned 
friends, of course, aren't above using Felgolos as an 
information-gatherer, or aiming him (rather as one goads a goat, or 
obliquely suggests something to a restless child without saying it 
directly and thus being refused) at particular places or folk to have 
him "stir things up." Elminster, for one, admits to sending Felgolos to 
"annoy and crash through" the work of the Zhentarim operating out of 
Darkhold (one of the reasons the Black Network hasn't been more dominant
 in the Far Hills area) or to check on activity in the vicinity of 
Hellgate Keep and Hellgate Dell.</p>
<p class="size2">The sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate (a rising authority 
on the history of dragons up and down the Sword Coast) describes 
Felgolos as "an eternal wide-eyed blunderer, ignorant of draconic 
etiquette and ways, but more learned in the doings of humans and treants
 and hedgehogs than the wisest sage alive." Elminster says that Felgolos
 seems almost not to think of himself as a dragon and to have no 
interest in others of his kind -- other than to regard bronze dragons as
 trustworthy friends on sight.</p>
<p class="size2">The archmage Malchor Harpell once commented that 
Felgolos "seems to have more bounce (buoyant good humor and optimism) 
than anyone I've ever known -- and probably more than any entity active 
in Faer√ªn today, short of Tymora herself." Certainly the adventurer 
Toross of the elves, known for his boundless energy and high spirits, 
tried to accompany the Flying Misfortune for a time (riding on his back,
 as a trusted friend) and later described the experience as "exhausting .
 . . his gusty high spirits wore me down as winter gales tear through 
leafless branches."</p>
<p class="size2">Felgolos has never shown any evidence of cunning or 
prudence, but great good luck seems to accompany him -- always preceded 
by clumsiness and a pratfall or two. He is said to be quick and expert 
in his use of spells, especially when surprised and attacked, but he 
seems to have few other accomplishments beyond sensitivity to the needs 
of others, wisdom in the ways of ail surface-world living things, and 
accomplished storm flying. He loves to ride the wild winds of gales, 
lightning storms, and even hurricanes. He never seems to take harm from 
the crackling aerial discharges or tearing winds, however, no matter how
 furious the weather.</p>
<p class="size2">Some sages have even advanced the theory that Felgolos 
is the avatar of "a sleeping god" or "a child of Akadi." No "certain 
death" dealt to him seems to be final, and no foe seems to be able to 
destroy him utterly, though he has been badly beaten many times. His 
typical response to these defeats is to forget about the battle -- 
though not who his foes were -- rather than to seek revenge. If there is
 some hidden divinity to Felgolos, or even just a favor of Tymora 
guarding him, the Flying Misfortune is honestly unaware of it.</p>
<p class="size2">Elminster says the secret behind Felgolos' astonishing 
survival dates from the twenty-odd years following the departure of his 
parents. They tried to keep him safe by offering his service as a steed 
to a certain archwizard of Halruaa, one Thongameir "Stormspells" 
Halargoth. Stormspells was a kindly old collector of rare plants and 
mosses who liked nothing better than to fly across half Faer√ªn looking 
at wilderlands, stopping for a picnic luncheon, scooping up a few 
specimens, and then wending his way home to Narthtowers, a mountainside 
keep in northern Halruaa that simply bristled with intelligent 
carnivorous bushes, vines, and similar deadly specimens. Felgolos was 
happy to take him on such "poking around seeing things" jaunts, and they
 got on famously -- despite several close calls, such as the time they 
landed in the middle of an encamped orc horde one night, or the time 
they interrupted a conclave of hundreds of gathered spirit naga in a 
jungle valley deep in Chult.</p>
<p class="size2">Such adventures made Thongameir aware that Felgolos 
could make them both far safer if certain spells were worked upon his 
draconic steed. So he cast a mighty and permanent manyfold magic on the 
bronze dragon. The spell's secrets have presumably, with Thongameir's 
death, been lost -- though some of their secrets may exist in written 
form, somewhere within the now-overgrown Narthtowers. Interested 
adventurers are warned that the plants growing there have slain several 
young and ambitious Halruaan mages. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Felgolos' Lair</b></p>
<p class="size2">It could be said that the Flying Misfortune has no true
 lair but rather a score of favorite sleeping spots. Most of them are 
shallow depressions in high mountain ridges, where he won't be 
disturbed. He does, however, have a few places where he keeps things, 
and some might judge these to be "lairs." In both the Thunder Peaks 
range and the Troll Mountains, Felgolos frequents mountain-locked high 
valleys where he can drink from lakes and keep free-ranging herds of 
stolen roth√©, sheep, goats, and cattle for food. The one in the Thunder 
Peaks has a mountainside cavern large enough to hold Felgolos (if he 
crawls in) and some keepsakes. These include a huge canopied bed (for 
humans to sleep in relative comfort, if the dragon should bring them 
here), a small sailing ship (in case Felgolos ever finds someone who 
needs one), and even a castle drawbridge the Flying Misfortune once tore
 away from a fortress so that he could spill the mounted knights on it 
into the moat, one by one, after giving them an entertainingly wild ride
 in his claws as he dove, looped, and swooped around the battlements.</p>
<p class="size2">In another cave somewhere along the Sword Coast, 
Felgolos has a growing collection of wagons gained from Zhentarim. 
Whenever he swoops low to look at a caravan owned by the Black Network, 
its guards fire crossbow bolts or spells at him. The Flying Misfortune 
responds by snatching up a souvenir wagon, beasts of burden and all, and
 taking it away to add to his hoard. If it contains people (Zhents often
 transport bound captives under other cargo, and sometimes they ride in 
their own wagons, particularly when guarding precious goods) or food, 
Felgolos often empties it en route. Zhents are typically dropped into a 
lake after a terrifying dive toward its waiting waters, but otherwise 
Felgolos does nothing but store the stolen wagon. He doesn't care if 
others find his "ghost caravan" and pilfer from it. Indeed, he often 
plucks a wagon up to take to a traveler on the road whose own conveyance
 has lost a wheel or overturned.</p>
<p class="size2">In all of the Flying Misfortune's lairs one may find 
odd coins (even a chest or coffer of wealth in the "ghost caravan"), but
 Felgolos doesn't collect or value coins, gems, or jewelry.</p>
<p class="size2">Felgolos seems to be a contented loner, but he 
sometimes teams up with a bored archmage (even one of the Seven Sisters,
 perhaps, seeking a momentary vacation of sightseeing and prank playing)
 for an adventure or two, or even comes to Shadowdale or Candlekeep for 
aid. The sages of Candlekeep so value his knowledge that they now 
eagerly trade lore with him; Elminster or Jhessail can furnish him with a
 little spell-muscle or a human ally.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Felgolos' Domain</b></p>
<p class="size2">Felgolos roams Faer√ªn more or less freely, ignoring the
 territories claimed by other dragons or creatures. By and large, such 
entities have learned that it is easiest to ignore the intrusions of the
 Flying Misfortune; fighting or trying to entrap him always carries a 
cost, and the bronze dragon clearly has no intention of carving out a 
domain of his own, seizing treasure, or competing in any lasting manner 
for food.</p>
<p class="size2">The bronze dragon is, however, sensitive to the needs 
and desires of others, and he tends to avoid the home ranges of mated 
dragons whom he knows are rearing young. The danger of war, wizards' 
duels, and the like is not a deterrent to Felgolos, however -- news of 
such things is likely to attract him.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Felgolos</b></p>
<p class="size2">The favorite prey of Felgolos is any sort of herd 
animal he can swoop on from above when he comes upon them in his 
wanderings; he finds having to hunt deliberately for food to be 
tiresome. He doesn't seem to have any favorite spells, watering holes, 
or hunting grounds -- doing things differently (and recklessly) all the 
time is life itself to the Flying Misfortune. His lack of planning and 
prudence often leads to the mishaps that have earned him his nickname --
 but it is fatal to believe that Felgolos never learns from his 
battlefield mistakes nor recognizes individuals who've done him harm in 
the past.</p>
<p class="size2">Felgolos spends most of his days wandering Faer√ªn, 
spying on the deeds of others, playing pranks on them or aiding them as 
the whim takes him, and looking for fresh fun (or at least interest).</p>
<p class="size2">Felgolos is famous for two things: tearing off the 
tallest tower of the Citadel of the Raven and using it as a club to swat
 enraged beholders out of the sky (after they rose all around him), and 
for the <i>frame teleport</i> spell he (or perhaps Stormspells) 
developed -- which he uses to enter (or partially enter, for a good look
 around) areas whose entrances are too small for his body. He has used 
this spell to eavesdrop on covert meetings of conspirators (in one 
instance posing as a "stuffed dragon head" on a wail), bedchamber 
conferences, secret priestly rituals, and even wizards at work on their 
spells. </p>

<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Once very 1d4 rounds, 
Felgolos can breathe either an 80-foot line of lightning or a 40-foot 
cone of repulsion gas. The lightning breath deals 8d6 points of 
electricity damage (Reflex DC 20 half). Any creature caught within the 
area of the repulsion gas must make a Will save (DC 20) or be compelled 
to do nothing but move away from Felgolos for 1d6 + 4 rounds. This is a 
mind-influencing compulsion enchantment effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>speak with animals; </i>3/day -- <i>polymorph self </i>(change to one new form and back per use). Caster level 14th; save DC 15 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells: </b>Felgolos casts spells as a 14th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Low-Light Vision: </b>Felgolos can see four times as
 far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar 
low-light conditions, and twice as far under normal light conditions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Thongameir's Master Spell (Su): </b>This powerful, 
enduring spell was cast upon Felgolos by the archmage Thongameir. It has
 three effects; all three function only against effects that are subject
 to spell resistance. If the attack is one that affects multiple 
creatures, other creatures are affected normally and Felgolos is 
unharmed (Thongameir's magic doesn't protect anyone other than Felgolos 
himself). Like actual spell resistance, Felgolos can suppress this 
ability when he wants to accept certain spells. </p>
<p class="size2">All Enchantment effects that would affect at Felgolos 
have no effect other than to cure a number of hit points equal to one 
point per spell level of the magical attack. Hit points in excess of his
 normal total remain for one day as temporary hit points. Successive 
enchantment effects simply cure more hit points or give him more 
temporary hit points (these temporary hit points do not stack with 
themselves, so if he is at full hit points and hit by a 9th-level 
Enchantment spell followed by a 1st-level enchantment spell, he has only
 9 temporary hit points). Effects without a spell level do not give him 
hit points but still do not affect him. </p>
<p class="size2">All Necromancy magics cast at Felgolos have no effect 
other than to give him a limited fast healing ability for one day, 
restoring hit points per hour equal to 1 hit point per spell level of 
the necromantic attack. This effect has brought the dragon back from 
apparent death more than once. Multiple Necromancy effects do not stack;
 he gains the most favorable rate of limited fast healing from the 
attacks directed against him (so if struck with a 9th-level Necromancy 
spell and a 1st-level Necromancy spell, Felgolos heals 9 hit points per 
hour for the next day). Effects without a spell level do not give him 
fast healing but still do not otherwise affect him. </p>
<p class="size2">All Transmutation magics of 5th-level or higher cast at Felgolos have no effect except to allow the dragon to cast a single <i>teleport</i> spell (caster level 25th) at any time within the next day. Multiple Transmutation effects give him multiple uses of this <i>teleport</i>
 spell, each with its own time of expiration. Transmutation effects of 
less than 5th level have no effect whatsoever, but do not give him the 
ability to use <i>teleport.</i></p>

<p class="size2"><b>Felgolos' Fate</b></p>
<p class="size2">Whim, curiosity, and a desire to revel in constant fun 
govern every act of Felgolos. He is likely always to find fresh trouble 
to blunder into, and he will always like helping creatures who are lost 
or in need. Sooner or later, such acts are bound to bring him his death,
 yet he has cheated certain doom so often that it is hard to say what, 
if anything, can destroy him. Perhaps the claims of sages about his 
divine nature are true.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Felgolos' Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">The Flying Misfortune has always been interested in 
magic -- both watching others work it and experimenting on his own. He 
prefers to develop his own spells rather than to gain them from others 
via seizure or trading; however, spellbooks, spell scrolls, and magic 
items are among the few things the Flying Misfortune does like to 
acquire in his wanderings. Where he keeps them, no one knows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Snatchport**<br></b>Transmutation (Teleportation)<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> Object weighing up to 50 lb./level</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">As <i>teleport</i>, except as noted above, and that the
 object's destination must also be within spell range. Normally the 
spell is used to move one large object within range to another location,
 such as a tree stump, treasure chest, wagon, and so on (multiple items 
within a container such as a belt pouch or chest count as one object).</p>
<p class="size2">As with <i>teleport</i>, a teleport check is needed to see how well the teleport works.</p>
<p class="size2">**This spell may be replaced by a <i>teleport object</i> spell to appear in a yet unpublished product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Frame Teleport<br></b><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, F<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous or up to 1 round/2 levels</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">As <i>teleport</i>, except as noted above, and with a <i>frame teleport</i>
 spell, you link two wooden frames (such as picture frames, mirrors, 
windows, and so on), so you can pass through one frame and exit through 
the other, ending the spell. Alternatively, you can stop partway through
 the link with at least one-quarter of your body on one side and the 
remainder on the other; this holds the magical link open for up to 1 
round/2 levels, during which you can act appropriately on either side as
 if the two frames were the end points of a normal doorway. This second 
use allows you to converse, pass objects back and forth, or make attacks
 at creatures on either side. Other beings cannot pass through the frame
 doorway, but they can push or pull you (such as with a bull rush). If 
you are ever forced fully onto one side or the other of the frame, the 
spell ends immediately.</p>
<p class="size2">If the spell ends while you are still partway through 
the doorway, you are forced completely through to the destination side 
and suffer 1d10 points of damage from being "scrambled" by the teleport.</p>
<p class="size2">Aiming the link to the destination frame requires a 
teleport check; if the result is "off target" and no suitable frame is 
at that location, the spell fails.</p>
<p class="size2">The spell functions regardless of the material 
contained within the two frames, and it does not harm that material, so 
you can use a mirror's frame without breaking the mirror, a painting's 
frame without damaging the canvas, and so on.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Focus:</i> The origin frame.</p>
