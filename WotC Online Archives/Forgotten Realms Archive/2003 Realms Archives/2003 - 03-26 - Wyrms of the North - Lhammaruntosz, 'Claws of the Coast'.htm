 the "Claws of the Coast," is a famous and often-seen bronze dragon who 
seems to like the company of humans far more than most wyrms -- even 
given the small but persistent numbers of adventurers who seize the 
opportunities provided by encounters with her to launch attacks on the 
wyrm. Her name brings to the fore something the Old Mage would like 
summarized before further revelations concerning Faer√ªnian dragons see 
print: how dragons are named.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Draconic Names</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Volo's
 notes include some speculations on the naming of dragons, but it has 
been left to Elminster briefly to set things straight.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dragons
 are vain creatures -- in most cases, too vain ever to change their 
names when assuming new identities, regardless of how many foes they 
acquire or how ridiculous a reputation they develop. Draconic names 
begin with a "usename" bestowed on them as a hatchling by a parent, 
sibling, or (if orphaned) either human observers or the named dragon 
itself. Such names are usually added to over the years as sounds strike 
the dragon's fancy, until many become overly long and well-nigh 
unpronounceable. Some dragons guard "secret syllables" of their name to 
confound hostile magic, or use a short form or even nickname (such as 
"Mist or "Bloodbror") exclusively.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Often
 a well-developed draconic name includes an echo or fragment of the name
 of a famous ancestor, or an unrelated wyrm the naming dragon desires to
 claim as a relative, or to be thought of as sharing characteristics 
with. For obvious reasons, such "namesake" dragons are usually deceased,
 though there have been cases where dragons seeking to "call out" 
ancient wyrms have taken on very similar names so as to enrage the 
missing wyrms into appearing.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 habit accounts for name syllables (endings, in particular) thought of 
as belonging to one gender, but in use by a wyrm of the other sex. 
Adventurers are cautioned never to try to guess the gender of a dragon 
purely from its name. It also explains some of the confusions between 
one dragon and another, as sometimes bards inadvertently merge the deeds
 of two or more dragons to feed the flames of growing legend.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 name "Lhammaruntosz," for example, echoes the famous name of Lhammarar,
 a smallish and much scarred copper dragon legendary for his 
aggressiveness. Lhammarar was ultimately dragged down beneath the waves 
and slain by a dragon turtle during a fierce storm; it's not known if he
 ever mated, and Lhammaruntosz is certainly no blood relation to him. 
Her name also echoes that of her mother, Tauntzoth, who in turn used the
 name of a male grandsire of gigantic size and reputation.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Claws of the Coast</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 is a bronze she-dragon who runs a merchant shipping line along the 
Sword Coast. She'll often appear when one of her vessels is endangered, 
which suggests she magically scrys their progress. She preys on pirates 
and others who cross her business interests, and her depredations alone 
have made the Nelanther passable to shipping in recent years. Reports of
 her fleet vary wildly depending on who's doing the telling, but most 
sources agree she owns over two dozen cogs and caravels and has buyers 
and cargo-escort agents operating on more than a dozen other vessels.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 kindly and inquisitive dragon Lhammaruntosz avoids combat with other 
dragons whenever possible, but she reportedly possesses very powerful 
magic items that can cause acid-ball explosions in midair to harm 
draconic foes (<i>wands of energy substititon (acid) fireball</i>, caster level 10).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 often delivers "fast mail" messages and small items by flying them from
 one of her agents (on a ship just put out to sea) to another (on a ship
 nearing port), dropping them on a line as she passes over the ship. She
 holds one end of such a "dropline" in her jaws; its other end sports a 
hook to catch in rigging or to be caught and secured for crew, and close
 above the hook is a mesh bag that can hold small, cloak-wrapped bundles
 of valuables. "Mother Wyrm" (as her crews have dubbed her) prepares and
 loads such lines by means of <i>unseen servant</i> spells.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 sailors who crew Mother Wyrm's fleet love the protection a dragon owner
 can provide and are proud of flying her "Scaly Eye" banner, though most
 other Coast sailors think their tales of a bronze dragon fighting for 
them, towing them away from shoals, or dropping messages to them are so 
much wild fancy. Merchant rivals aren't so quick to scoff.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Scaly Eye</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Scaly Eye banner, often seen on ships docked up and down the Sword 
Coast, is a long blue pennant displaying a single staring eye weeping a 
spreading fan of tears, above which arches an eyebrow. Both the tears 
and the brow, if examined closely, can be seen to be made of shaped 
representations of dragon scales. The artwork, reputed to be that of 
Lhammaruntosz herself, is impressive, not crude or amusing.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 a measure of the growing reputation of the Claws of the Coast that 
certain vessels have recently been seen flying false Scaly Eye banners; 
the bronze dragon has torn one such ship (a pirate vessel masquerading 
as one of her fleet) apart at sea and then sent her sailors to forcibly 
persuade other ship captains to refrain from unauthorized use of her 
banner -- unless, of course, they plan to turn ownership and 
administration of their boats over to her. (At least five terrified ship
 captains have done just that, including the well-known sea merchant 
Essegn Anarvible of Neverwinter.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One
 of the High Captains of Luskan is thought to have crossed swords with 
the Scaly Eye ships in the past, but he seems to have made his peace 
with the dragon. Dark rumors of the confrontation and feud between 
Rethnor Redcloak and Lhammaruntosz abound, but hard facts on this topic 
have proven as hard to grasp as smoke.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Rise of Lhammaruntosz</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Claws of the Coast was a hatchling of the crazed she-dragon Tauntzoth 
of the Rocks, who dwelt in a cave on the bare, windswept Finback, 
tallest of the Whalebones. Savage and cunning, Tauntzoth slew or drove 
away all others of her kind as she grew older and spent her days winging
 far and wide across the Sword Coast North, slaying all large creatures 
who defied her or whose looks she didn't like.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Increasingly
 Tauntzoth became convinced that a mysterious overdragon, whom she 
dubbed "the Unseen" because she could never find any trace of him, was 
stalking her, intending to enslave her and force her to bear his 
offspring -- dragons who would be born alive and whole, and would eat 
and tear their ways out of her, killing her horribly.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">No
 evidence for the existence of the Unseen has appeared outside 
Tauntzoth's mind, but to her, every creature was an agent of her "Dark 
Doom," except her own offspring (whose fathers she slew) -- and, to her,
 they were rebels and potential rivals better slain anyway. One of the 
last of these unfortunate children seems to have been Rauthra, the 
future Lhammaruntosz, who spent her formative years spread-eagled and 
helpless in her mother's lair, anchored down by an extensive web of 
spell-reinforced chains and manacles.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tauntzoth
 developed spells dealing with regeneration and experimented with them 
on her hapless daughter. Her gift for the art of magic was strong, and 
to this day Lhammaruntosz swiftly regenerates lost limbs and organs. 
Tauntzoth regenerated even faster but she couldn't resist augmenting her
 powers with ever-greater spells until her body grew a wild and endless 
succession of spare limbs, wings, headless necks, and tails, becoming a 
clumsy thing that was obviously "the Curse of the Unseen" come down upon
 her. This process accelerated for some seasons, until her body 
ultimately collapsed into a boneless mass.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 the final years of her life, the quickening and uncontrollable growth 
of her body made Tauntzoth a vast and horrifying monster -- a 
cavern-filling mass of writhing flesh that was continually exuding new 
extremities. It also made her ache (or "burn," as she often howlingly 
described it) with continual hunger. Her solution was near at hand: her 
daughter, the mistrusted and thoroughly cowed object of her experiments.
 Strengthened regeneration magic made permanent by the most powerful 
spellcasting allowed Rauthra to survive being eaten more or less 
continuously.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 young dragon spent at least two centuries as a chained, partly devoured
 prisoner of her mother -- and decades thereafter as an abandoned 
prisoner, kept from a death of despair and starvation only by her 
regenerative magic, her hunger to see the world outside her cave, and 
whatever vermin she could find nearby to keep her body regenerating. 
With increasing frustration she awaited the failure of spell after spell
 until she could burst the last of her chains and win freedom at last.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 cruel rearing has left its scars; imprisonment and personal restraint 
are threats that make Lhammaruntosz go berserk even today, some six 
centuries after she first flew out of the Finback and left the horror of
 her mother's lair forever. The old northern ballad "The Wandering 
Wyrm," believed to have been the work of the halfling minstrel 
Aldersound Bucklebar, recounts a few incidents of her wide-ranging 
explorations of Faer√ªn at this time.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Claws of the Coast spent almost four centuries wandering about Faer√ªn, 
fighting off and fleeing from all the hostile dragons whose domains she 
inadvertently entered. She owes her survival to her regenerative powers 
and her swiftness to flee; never interested in fighting for territory 
and possessed of very little personal pride, Lhammaruntosz never lingers
 to destroy a foe but simply strikes to defend herself, end an immediate
 problem, and be on her way again. She has shown a whimsical side and an
 impulsive desire to aid lone, beleaguered creatures -- and her "swoop 
from the sky" rescues earned her fame in human lore and several 
outstanding debts owed to her by such diverse folk as the mage Malchor 
Harpell, several senior Harpers, and the priest Tolgar Anuvien of 
Goldenfields. Her attacks substantially weakened the Broken Bone orc 
horde in 1024 DR, and she was the mysterious "wyrm gliding by night" 
that plucked the shipwrecked explorer Havilar Culdorn (founder of the 
Blackbacks Trading Coster, forerunner of many of the wealthy trading 
houses of present-day Amn) from the waves of the Sea of Swords after the
 pirate-shattering Battle of Blazing Sails in 1211 DR.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 seems to have ended her wandering only recently, taking the "resting 
lair" (an open-to-the elements, hoardless sleeping spot) of the old 
green dragon Skarlthoon. Known as "Snarljaws" because of her temper, 
Skarlthoon died in 1348 DR of some disease that ate away her scales and 
then the flesh beneath, covering her with creeping moss. The Claws of 
the Coast then seems to have fought some unknown dragon to the death and
 gained its inland lair; Elminster believes that this hidden hold must 
lie somewhere south and east of Secomber, in the broken land that marks 
the edge of the High Moor -- and that its lingering magic is enough to 
make the wandering Lhammaruntosz feel secure. (She chose the Sword Coast
 from Neverwinter to Velen as her favorite haunt.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This,
 in turn, allowed her to build a family to oversee and be part of her 
merchant fleet, the ships of the Scaly Eye, which began to sail sometime
 around 1361 DR, but only grew to prosperity and reputation after the 
Year of the Staff (1366 DR), after her battles against pirates earned 
her the trust of merchant clients. Two keys to the success of the Scaly 
Eye were the two sisters Draeth: two fat and unlovely, but very astute, 
women from Leilon, Astlarthe and Dlareen. They brought the bronze dragon
 enough honest news and opinions of human doings and intrigues to 
fascinate her with the strivings of humans and to make her want to be 
involved in such things continuously. The Draeths, though much crippled 
with arthritis, remain the most trusted, high-ranking, and important 
agents of the Scaly Eye. Based in Neverwinter and Mintarn respectively, 
they deal in cargoes and special handling agreements for their "Mother" 
and can count on her personal protection and financial support in all 
they do. Beyond a hunger for the company of young and handsome men, they
 seem to lack vices and weaknesses -- and after encounters with some 
watchful Harpers and a certain enraged bronze she-dragon, Luskanite 
rivals have learned not to try slaying them.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today,
 Lhammaruntosz is a bronze dragon of what humans call "very old" years, 
sleek in build but often battered in appearance. Her craggy face is 
homely for a dragon and always seems somehow more kindly than majestic. 
The works of her mother have left her with a fear and mistrust of magic,
 but also with the determination that no one will ever easily overcome 
her defenses and harm or enslave her with magic again, so the Claws of 
the Coast gathers all the magic she can, while avoiding both unnecessary
 spellcasting and all magical experimentation.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 finds it hard to trust anyone and keeps her own company; any need to 
share a small area with other sentient creatures for more than a few 
hours will make her irritable, suspicious, and constantly on her guard. 
At the same time, she feels a need to be accepted by a friendly group of
 beings who share a common purpose. (It is fair to say, Elminster and 
the "Dragon Sage" Velsaert of Baldur's Gate agree, that the folk of her 
Scaly Eye fleet serve as the family she never had -- and that her 
mistrust of other dragons will probably ensure that she never does have a
 draconic family.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 is gifted with a remarkable sense of direction and distance, honed by 
her years of wandering, and she can find her way to small and specific 
locations, even unfamiliar ones, in the dark and in poor weather, with a
 minimum of fuss and delay. She's often come out of the driving rain of a
 howling storm, low over the storm-tossed waves, wings beating 
powerfully among the wind gusts and the lightning, to check on one of 
her ships. Stricken vessels are promptly towed (all Scaly Eye ships are 
equipped with long, stout cables for this purpose, consisting of three 
ropes braided to each other to form one extra-thick length, which is 
anchored to "keel-trunks" set in the deck and carried wrapped around the
 inside of the deck-rail) or abandoned, their crews snatched aloft after
 lashing themselves to one another.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 is also developing a shrewd sense of human nature and knows when she's 
being lied to. The swindles and covert ways of merchants are becoming 
almost second nature to her, and she's learned to hold her tongue in 
patience, to test would-be allies and business partners, and to set 
aside personal feelings when a longtime ally turns sour, or long-term 
treachery is revealed. This calmness and understanding of others led to 
the "Mother Wyrm" nickname (coined as a result of her rescues) sticking,
 even in the face of the fiercer "Claws of the Coast" moniker, which 
grew out of tavern tales of her tearing apart pirate vessels to defend 
ships of her fleet. A slightly less respectful (or more unfriendly) 
variant of this, much heard among sailors, is "Mother Claws."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Velsaert
 reports that the key to Lhammaruntosz's character is her understanding 
of humans, but Elminster says her attentive, motherlike caring for other
 creatures -- many other beings, not just a chosen few partners or 
allies -- is what sets her apart from most wyrms. She hates pranks and 
deceptions of all kinds and is always analyzing folk and situations. Her
 actions may seem to occasionally be born out of imprudence or 
ignorance, but it is a mistake to assume so -- she has almost always 
thought (and prepared) several steps ahead.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Lhammaruntosz's Lair</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mother
 Wyrm has two homes -- a hidden inland hoard-lair whose whereabouts are 
unknown, and a "resting lair" in a bowl valley in the heights of 
Orlumbor. She visits the inland lair only when she needs to take shelter
 from severe winter weather, retrieve magic, or hide and think or heal; 
she is almost always found on Orlumbor or on the wing, somewhere above 
the Sword Coast. She visits coastal agents and informants often, even 
alighting on the coastal rocks near Lathtarl's Lantern every few days to
 talk to the gruff old retired fisherman Inglas Pholdaruk, whom she pays
 so well that he's been able to hire spies in many nearby villages to 
keep a very close watch over travelers, caravans, and local doings. As 
he put it, "I never thought I'd become someone important in my fireside 
years -- but bless old Mother Claws, I have!"</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Several
 Cult of the Dragon agents and ambitious adventurers have searched in 
vain for the inland lair of Lhammaruntosz. She may keep its entrance 
choked by a rockfall, for it's doubtful it has any defenders to keep 
folk out when she's not there. Nor do elaborate traps seem to be her 
style. What is certain is that it must hold some impressive magic items,
 because Mother Wyrm has swiftly produced such things from time to time,
 as conflicts dictate, and used them to telling effect.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Lhammaruntosz's Domain</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 Orlumbor, Lhammaruntosz ranges up and down the Sword Coast, avoiding 
the immediate vicinity of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, but going so far 
as to perch beside the walls of Neverwinter and Velen on occasion. 
Hardened against the ravages of exposure by her regenerative powers, the
 Claws of the Coast thinks nothing of hard landings or of simply 
stretching out on bare rock islets to wait out a storm, even when ice 
and snow cloak her resting form thickly.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mother
 Wyrm doesn't think of this territory as her exclusive domain, as most 
wyrms do; she'll ignore or perhaps calmly greet and pass other dragons 
who treat her the same way, fighting only those who offer her battle, or
 attack her property, the Scaly Eye folk, or her friends.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Lhammaruntosz</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lhammaruntosz
 doesn't need to eat much, but her childhood near-starvation has given 
her a loathing of hunger. She prefers to eat lightly but often and to 
vary her diet greatly, firmly deciding to try new things and never to 
adopt any "favorite fare."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 day to day, Lhammaruntosz busies herself aiding, defending, and 
watching over the sailors, agents, and merchants who serve under the 
Scaly Eye banner. She seldom undertakes expeditions away from the Sword 
Coast these days and prides herself on being very well informed as to 
coastal news and events. Word of strange magic or armed bands engaging 
in open conflict brings her immediate interest -- and often a "go and 
see" flight. Some folk are of the opinion that her presence and habit of
 swift response have kept forces of Luskan from infiltrating or openly 
attacking Neverwinter and has kept Leilon safe from brigandry without 
its citizens lifting more than a few fingers in their own defense.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once every 1d4 rounds, Lhammaruntosz can breathe a 100-foot line of 
electricity. Any creature in that area takes 18d6 points of electricity 
damage (Reflex DC 32 half).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once every 1d4 rounds, Lhammaruntosz can breathe a 50-foot cone of 
repulsion gas. Any creature in that area must succeed at a Reflex save 
(DC 32) or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 
1d6+9 rounds. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment effect.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crush (Ex):</b>
 When flying or jumping, Lhammaruntosz can land on Small or smaller 
opponents as a standard action, using her whole body to crush them. A 
crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under Lhammaruntosz's 
body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save 
(DC 32) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the
 next round unless she moves off. If Lhammaruntosz chooses to maintain 
the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack (grapple bonus +48). A 
pinned opponent takes crush damage each round if it doesn't escape.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b>
 This ability takes effect automatically when Lhammaruntosz attacks, 
charges, or flies overhead. It affects only opponents within 270 feet 
that have 29 or fewer Hit Dice. The affected creature must make a 
successful Will save (DC 31) or become panicked (if 4 or fewer HD) or 
shaken (if more than 5 HD). Success indicates that the target is immune 
to Lhammaruntosz's frightful presence for one day.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>speak with animals;</i> 3/day -- <i>create food and water, detect thoughts, fog cloud, polymorph self.</i> Caster level 13th; save DC 16 + spell level. Lhammaruntosz's <i>polymorph self</i>
 ability works just like the spell, except that each use allows only one
 change, which lasts until she assumes another form or reverts to her 
own (which does not count as a use of this ability).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Blindsight (Ex): </b>Lhammaruntosz
 can ascertain creatures by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, 
but also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues) to a range
 of 270 feet. Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though she still
 can't discern ethereal beings. Lhammaruntosz usually does not need to 
make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of her 
blindsight ability.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b>
 Lhammaruntosz regains hit points at the rate of 2 per round. Fast 
healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or 
suffocation, but it does allow Lhammaruntosz to regrow or reattach lost 
body parts.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Low-Light Vision:</b> Lhammaruntosz can see four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Healing Burst (Ex):</b>
 Three times per day, Lhammaruntosz may accelerate her body's fast 
healing ability, healing 6d4 points of damage. This is a standard 
action, and works exactly as if she had healed the damage with fast 
healing.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b>
 Lhammaruntosz can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use 
her breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/8/8/7/7/7/5; save DC 16 + spell level): 0 -- <i>detect magic, disrupt undead, flare, light, mage hand, mending, open/close, read magic, resistance;</i> 1st -- <i>alarm, charm person, endure elements, expeditious retreat, unseen servant; </i>2nd -- <i>darkness, endurance, invisibility, resist elements, whispering wind;</i> 3rd -- <i>dispel magic, protection from elements, suggestion, tongues;</i> 4th -- <i>arcane eye, dimension door, scrying, stoneskin; </i>5th -- <i>cloudkill, prying eyes, Rary's telepathic bond; </i>6th -- <i>acid fog, greater dispelling. </i></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Lhammaruntosz's Fate</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Cult of the Dragon is increasingly interested in the Claws of the Coast
 because of her interest in human society, her profitable shipping fleet
 (which could be turned to enriching them, were she to become a 
dracolich under their control), and -- most importantly -- her 
regenerative powers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Certain
 individuals within the Cult are secretly researching a means of 
magically achieving "weredragonhood" (that is, acquiring the means to 
temporarily take on fully-powered draconic shapes, when desired, though 
the term is a misnomer because dragons are not animals and thus this 
ability is unrelated to lycanthropy and the moon), so as to use their 
abilities against not only the hostile world but against fellow Cult 
members and rise from the lower ranks to leadership of the Cult. At 
least two of them (Elminster smilingly refused to furnish names) covet 
Lhammaruntosz's regenerative powers, seeing them as a means to virtual 
immortality for either humans or weredragon-humans.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Whether
 or not what aids her can be made to aid anyone else is a mystery "best 
left to the gods," Elminster commented, "because it's a rather certain 
bet that no mortal knows."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 Lhammaruntosz eludes the clutches of all the folk who want to get their
 hands on her powers, she still risks treachery at the claws of any 
dragon she dares trust enough to mate with; Elminster sees the chances 
of her developing any such trust as being extremely unlikely. This would
 seem to indicate a long and lonely life, with eventual destruction at 
the hands of a magically powerful foe that can shatter her regenerative 
powers. The usual candidates for such villainy (such as the Brotherhood 
of the Arcane, Red Wizards, Zhentarim, and the phaerimm) are all likely 
to see Mother Wyrm as a useful slave-steed and to try to magically 
control her mind rather than destroy her utterly.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Lhammaruntosz's Magic</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Little
 is known of the spells wielded by the Claws of the Coast; they seem to 
be both minor and familiar. She even employs her natural abilities (such
 as polymorphing into other creature forms) very sparingly. On several 
occasions, however, she has used her "acid-ball wand" in aerial battle. 
Elminster says this is an old Halruaan weapon similar to the one used by
 the wyrm Malaeragoth (and he'll give us details of this particularly 
wicked wand with that dragon's chronicle).</span></p>
