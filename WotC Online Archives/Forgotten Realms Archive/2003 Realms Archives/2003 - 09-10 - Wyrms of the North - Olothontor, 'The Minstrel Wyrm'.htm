<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-- Stanza from "Oh, Come, Let Me Sing," a Harper drinking ballad of anonymous collective authorship </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some
 Harper legends live and breathe, though they're thought by most to be 
mere failing figments of fancy or memory. Olothontor "the Old," the Wyrm
 of Minstrelry, is one such; even many Harpers think him a 
minstrel-embroidered figure of legend.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yet,
 as Volo found (very nearly to his ultimate cost), Olothontor lives not 
far north of Waterdeep. This venerable blue he-dragon keeps to himself 
save when intruders call, and he has thereby completely escaped the 
notice of other dragons and -- save as a Harper legend -- of the many 
residents of Waterdeep.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Olothontor
 loves music above all else and gives extravagant gifts to lady bards 
and minstrels whose work pleases him. He dreams of someday finding a 
mate: a blue dragon who can sing as enchantingly as a splendid human 
singer. He has sometimes wistfully told intruders who get him to talk 
about music about this dream, but no Cult of the Dragon member or other 
intruder has yet empowered a blue she-dragon to sing, even temporarily. 
Intruders into his lair who play or sing won't be attacked, so long as 
they furnish good music and plenty of it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">First
 heard of in trail lore books written circa 570 DR and now collected at 
Candlekeep, young Olothontor recklessly raided traders encamped at what 
is now the Rat Hills. Olothontor was observed to break off his attack 
and perch on the drifting hulk of a ship he'd just demasted (and 
depopulated) to listen when a trio of spellsingers broke into song. The 
spell they raised was a defensive dome that twisted incoming lightning 
bolts into outgoing, stabbing rays of cold -- as the blue dragon 
discovered to his chagrin when the song ended and he bounded into the 
air (sinking the ship) to renew his attack. Wounded, he fled, flying 
raggedly -- but no one there failed to notice that he veered away during
 his second attack so as not to harm the three humans who'd sung.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Oebryn
 Evergar, a bard exploring Anauroch some years later, spoke of 
encountering Olothontor half-buried in the sand, obviously ready to 
attack. Instead, the wyrm merely raised his head, causing a shower of 
sand, to listen as the initially unwitting bard sang his way closer. The
 blue dragon paced along beside the bard like a restless cat on the 
prowl, demanding more songs until night fell and the bard fled, 
whereupon the dragon devoured his camels. When morning came, and Evergar
 grimly set out on foot to meet his doom under the scorching sun, the 
dragon swooped down and shaded him with a spread wing, all that day, 
demanding in return more songs. Thus they traveled, Evergar and the 
dragon, for several days until the edge of the desert was reached and 
the bard slipped away from the seemingly tireless Olothontor by walking 
on through the night.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Minstrels
 who traded ballads around a shared campfire in the Sword Coast 
wilderlands some years later reported discovering, as they settled down 
for slumber, that a blue dragon had crept up to the fire to listen, 
lying flat on the ground less than 10 yards from the flames.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 Harper, leading a song around another campfire in the North a decade 
later, realized something was amiss when one of the bass voices joining 
in was so deep that it set the jaws of everyone present to chattering. 
When he strode away from the fire to investigate, he found himself 
eyeball-to-eyeball with a blue dragon, its chin on its paws.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Continue,"
 it rumbled, "just as before, and all will be well." The Harper did just
 that. A dozen or more similar incidents were recorded until the night 
in 726 DR when a successful company of adventurers calling themselves 
Glaerikim's Band set about to lure and trap this dragon who listened to 
music. They hired an unwitting handful of minstrels to perform in a 
wilderland forest glade, having first built (and concealed, under hides 
heaped with leafy tree boughs and mosses) a quartet of loaded ballistae 
in the trees. Glaerikim himself sat in the top of the tallest nearby 
tree as night fell, watching the darkening skies as the music began. 
When the silhouette of a dragon glided silently overhead, turned, and 
settled slowly to the ground, Glaerikim slipped down the rope he'd left 
ready and went to each ballista, helping to unhood it as quietly as 
possible. When the music ended around the embers of the dying fire, one 
of the minstrels (as instructed) loudly beckoned the others over to a 
corner of the clearing, to "teach them a secret song." When Glaerikim 
saw the dark bulk of the dragon steal nearer, he whistled -- and four 
ballista-bolts flashed at their target. One missed, one glanced off, one
 struck and shivered apart -- and one tore through a wing, earning a 
roar of rage and pain that shook the very trees. The dragon made a 
wildly flapping ascent into the sky. The adventurers stood their ground,
 ready to blast the wyrm with their most powerful magic items as the 
dragon wheeled against the stars.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They
 never got a chance to wield them. One minstrel alone escaped by 
plunging into a crevice between two rotting fallen trees and feigning 
death for hours, and from his telling we know that lightning lashed that
 glade in crackling bursts as bright as day, hurling cooked bodies high 
into the air in repeated macabre dances, while the air echoed with howls
 of rage and savage songs of doom -- snatches of the same triumphant 
battle-songs that humans were wont to sing all over Faerûn in those 
days. Awed, the survivor told everyone of the Minstrel Wyrm who'd slain 
Glaerikim's Band and seven minstrels besides . . . and a new legend of 
the North was born.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 that day to this, tales of Olothontor have been dismissed as pure 
whimsy because the dragon is no longer seen crouching near firesides, 
and because sages scoff at the idea of a desert-lairing blue dragon, 
lover of hot winds and baking sun and sand, dwelling in the oft-frigid, 
damp Sword Coast lands. Velsaert of Baldur's Gate (fast becoming 
recognized as an authority on the history of dragons up and down the 
Sword Coast), had already investigated a tale told by the lady bard 
Duthchanna of Athkatla when Volo spoke with him.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Velsaert
 accompanied the Harper bard Schalalla Irdree on an expedition to find 
the Minstrel Wyrm (following Duthchanna's directions) and discovered 
that the dragon was alive and real, dwelling in caverns heated by a 
volcanic vent and employing magic to listen to music from afar, and even
 to "hold" the sounds of that music for days (to be heard over and over 
again). Velsaert and Schalalla escaped with their lives after Schalalla 
gave a performance that the sage described as "songs that repeatedly 
moved me to tears, despite the danger -- and more than once did the 
same, as near as I could tell, to the dragon." The Harper bard promised 
the dragon she'd return with different songs, a better harp, and alone a
 season later -- and, the sage believes, she kept that promise.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 far as Volo and Velsaert know, the Minstrel Wyrm still lairs near 
Waterdeep, waiting for the promised returns of various bards and 
minstrels. The keys to Olothontor's character are his hunger for music 
and his reported battle-calm; though betrayals enrage him as they do any
 dragon, he enters anticipated battles with easy, unruffled calm, and is
 undistracted by outsiders hurling spells into the fray.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Olothontor's Lair </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Olothontor
 dwells in a cavern in Mount Araddyn, just north of Mount Sar along the 
Coast Road. His lair is easily reached from the highway (up a 
boulder-studded meadow slope between two weathered rock arms of the 
mountain that bear many scorings where the blue dragon has sharpened his
 claws.) The front of the lair is a crumbling, old stone mansion that 
was once the home of the brother titans Endrigul and Roevryn Taluth -- 
and was later taken over by the self-styled "Gnome King" Karlus 
"Goldgoblet" Dlinshoulder to be the seat of his court, only to be 
emptied by repeated orc raids. Somewhere in its huge but hollow stone 
pillars are said to be hidden many brass pots full of gnome gold -- 
coins bearing the grinning, bristle-bearded likeness of Karlus. Today, 
travelers find the mansion pillaged of all but a few tumbled pieces of 
massive stone furniture, covered with a thick blanket of dust, bird 
droppings, and the bones of small animals.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Olothontor
 has placed spells in the huge central rooms (chambers built to a grand 
scale by the titans, with high frescoed ceilings balconies, and fluted 
pillars), so that any living creature entering them causes favorite 
songs to be heard. These magical "recordings" give the Minstrel Wyrm a 
warning of intrusion and awes the most timid of intruders into flight 
from this "haunted" place.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 innermost rooms (the last open to the sky, and its shattered ceiling 
allowing a deft dragon to drop down in a landing that must be more a 
precise pounce than anything else) run up to meet a cliff-face of Mount 
Araddyn -- and there lead into the cavern where the dragon dwells.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This cave is warm, wide, and long, and its floor is strewn with gravel (for use with Olothontor's <i>pebble wind</i>
 spell). Its floor is broken about two-thirds of the way in by a 
40-foot-wide chasm that drops down about 400 feet to a volcanic flow and
 splits the cavern from side to side. Hot air swirls up out of this 
chasm, and there is a faint, sullen red glow down below.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On
 the far side of the heated chasm, Olothontor lies at ease on a bed of 
treasure, his most prized items (magic musical instruments) behind him, 
well away from the heat. From time to time, as he shifts about, gold 
coins spill over the edge of the chasm. He'll await most intruders 
calmly, chin in hand, and demand music before he uses his spells or 
breath weapons on them. If sorely pressed, he'll leap across the chasm 
and burst through the intruders, seeking the open air of the mountain 
(where he'll perch and await emerging adventurers).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Would-be
 thieves and attackers must cross the chasm somehow, of course, with 
Olothontor free to strike at them. Well above the main cavern floor 
where the treasure lies is a high ledge lined with boulders; Olothontor 
can stretch up to it and bat the boulders at intruders (and when enough 
of them are gone, he can clamber up onto this ledge so that attackers 
must climb up to him).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 Olothontor observes a strong band of intruders coming from afar, he 
often awaits intruders in a side cave that opens into the walls of the 
chasm a short distance beneath the main cavern. Hidden there, he'll 
create an illusion of a bound and helpless human captive "standing" on 
the "solid stone" floor of the cavern. In other words, he'll conceal the
 empty air where the chasm gapes open with an illusory "floor" of stone,
 hoping to lure the intruders to their deaths through falling. 
Olothontor usually depicts a chained, furiously-struggling warrior 
woman, but he's had centuries to perfect this act and can also provide a
 very convincing, seductively beckoning princess, despairing merchant, 
and so on -- complete with detailed life histories, full knowledge of 
Sword Coast ways and business customs, and a tale of where the dragon 
has gone. Olothontor can surge up out of the "underneath" cavern with a 
roar to confront foes, or bound up in near silence. If the majority of a
 band of intruders fall for his illusion trick -- "The dragon can make 
himself very small and has gone down there to where he keeps his magic" 
-- the Minstrel Wyrm races to the opening of that half-mile long crevice
 and walls it shut by shoving a carefully carved boulder into place. He 
has three cottage-sized stones, each of which can seal off the end of 
the crevice -- two precisely, and one leaving small gaps around its 
edges. Olothontor simply shoves all three boulders in a heap and waits 
for the trapped intruders to starve or waste any powerful magic they 
might have in attempts to get out.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">No
 servants or companion creatures dwell in Olothontor's lair, but for 
about a fifth of each year, cumulative time, various Harpers and other 
bards can be found there on promised "return visits." Some of them have 
been making annual appearances for almost 20 years. These visits seldom 
overlap; Olothontor prefers to have one visitor at a time in his home.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Olothontor's Domain</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 his lair, Olothontor roams rarely. When he does, he may wing anywhere 
between Mintarn and Anauroch, and Neverwinter and Silverymoon to Tethyr,
 wherever he can hear music. Olothontor is well aware that other dragons
 regard certain areas as their personal domains, and he flies high or 
very low to avoid attention. He normally flies this way anyway; 
terrified, cowering humans seldom create tuneful music.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Olothontor
 would regard an attempt by any other dragon to dwell or habitually 
perch on Mount Araddyn as an invasion of his own domain -- and he would 
ferociously battle any wyrm foolish enough to lair nearby and regard 
Olothontor's presence as a threat to his or her domain. The Minstrel 
Wyrm really just wants to be left alone by other dragons -- as well as 
by rampaging orc hordes, human adventurers with greed and glory in their
 eyes and sharp swords or waiting spells in their hands . . . and anyone
 else who doesn't love music.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Olothontor</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 favorite prey of the Minstrel Wyrm is anything handy in the way of 
"hoofed beasts conveniently herded to Waterdeep for sale," which he 
likes to swoop down on and devour in a lightning-fast, gobbling raid (by
 night if need be). He goes for long periods without dining but has been
 known to gorge himself utterly when the opportunity presents itself -- 
such as the time he flew north to meet a southbound orc horde crossing 
the Evermoors and imitated the notorious red dragon Klauth by just 
rolling around on hundreds of orcs before settling down to a feast that 
lasted four days -- for it took that long for all the orcs streaming 
south to reach his jaws.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Like
 a hunting cat, Olothontor spends long periods dozing and even more time
 lounging on his bed of treasure listening to music or considering how 
best to employ his magic next. Olothontor collects music boxes and other
 mechanical or magical means of producing tunes, and he has amassed over
 600 such items. They occupy various high niches and ledges around the 
main cavern of the blue dragon's lair, on both sides of the chasm, and 
Olothontor knows the precise placing of each; if one is missing, moved, 
or damaged, he'll notice within a matter of hours and devotes all of his
 energies -- in a maniacal, at-all-costs manner -- to regaining the lost
 items.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Olothontor
 is believed to have mated only once, with a blue she-dragon of 
Anauroch. Ingeireirautha is a possessive, ruthless adult dragon who 
dwells near the eastern edge of the Great Desert and is so self-absorbed
 that she may have forgotten all about "Olothontor the Dreamer." For his
 part, Olothontor's disinterest in even meeting other dragons may well 
be founded in his experiences with Ingeireirautha, despite the three to 
five offspring they produced (most of whom flew away east or southeast 
soon after hatching, following -- or defying -- their mother's 
directions to Raurin).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Olothontor's
 current keen interest is in finding spells that can capture and 
reproduce music with ease, so that he can "record" music spontaneously 
and not have to arrange performances beforehand (or cast a spell and 
make his own music on the spot). He wants to acquire stray melodies or 
sounds whenever he hears them and ultimately build a library of joyous 
music instead of hiring musicians to play a few stilted songs that he 
must struggle to capture magically under exacting conditions. This drive
 to achieve faster, better spells consumes his driving energies, and 
he's thinking of sponsoring or coercing certain brilliant mages into 
crafting the spells he can see in his dreams.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once every 1d4 rounds, Olothontor can breathe a 100-foot line of 
lightning. Each creature in the area takes 18d8 points of electricity 
damage (Reflex DC 31 half).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crush (Ex):</b>
 When flying or jumping, Olothontor can land on Small or smaller 
opponents as a standard action, using his whole body to crush them. This
 attack affects a 15-foot-by-15-foot area. Each creature in the affected
 area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 31) or be pinned, automatically 
taking 2d8+16 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless 
Olothontor moves off of it. If he chooses to maintain the pin, treat it 
as a normal grapple attack. A pinned opponent takes damage from the 
crush each round it doesn't escape.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b>
 Olothontor can unsettle foes with his mere presence. This ability takes
 effect automatically whenever he attacks, charges, or flies overhead. 
Each creature within a radius of 180 feet that has less than 30 HD is 
subject to the effect. A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a
 Will save (DC 29) remains immune to Olothontor's frightful presence for
 one day. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD becomes panicked 
for 4d6 rounds, and one with 5 or more HD becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds.
 A panicked creature takes a -2 morale penalty on saving throws and must
 flee. A shaken creature takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, 
checks, and saving throws. Olothontor ignores the frightful presence of 
other dragons.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>ventriloquism; </i>1/day -- <i>hallucinatory terrain.</i> Caster level 11th.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spells:</b> Olothontor casts spells as an 11th-level sorcerer.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b>
 Olothontor can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. 
Opponents he can't actually see still have total concealment against 
him.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Create/Destroy Water</i> (Sp):</b> Three times per day, Olothontor can produce an effect like that of the <i>create water</i>
 spell, except that he can decide to destroy water instead of creating 
it. This effect automatically spoils unattended liquids containing 
water. A magic item (such as potions) or any item in a creature's 
possession must succeed at a Will save (DC 29) or be ruined. This 
ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b>
 Olothontor sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination 
and twice as well in normal light. It also has darkvision out to 120 
feet.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sound Imitation (Ex):</b>
 Olothontor can mimic any voice or sound he has heard, anytime he likes.
 A listener must succeed at a Will save (DC 29) to detect the ruse.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/7/7/7/7/4; save DC 14 + spell level): 0 -- <i>daze, detect magic, ghost sound, mage hand, mending, open/close, prestidigitation, read magic, resistance; </i>1st -- <i>comprehend languages, expeditious retreat, ghostharp (Magic of Faerûn, normally a Brd 0 spell), , identify, mage armor; </i>2nd -- <i>amplify</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn, </i>normally a Brd 1 spell), <i>darkness, detect thoughts, Melf's acid arrow, whispering wind;</i> 3rd -- <i>dispel magic, pebble wind</i> (see below), <i>protection from energy, vampiric touch;</i> 4th -- <i>phantasmal killer, shout, stoneskin;</i> 5th -- <i>cloudkill, wall of stone.</i></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Olothontor's Magic</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Minstrel Wyrm keeps his "recording" spells secret, and most of them 
seem to be decidedly unstable experimental magic at present, anyway. It 
should be noted that Olothontor uses sung, whistled, plucked, or hummed 
tunes to activate many waiting, "hung" spells around his lair -- spells 
that can trigger <i>darkness</i> effects, cause individual boulders to 
fall from the ceiling or to swing aside and allow a small avalanche of 
loose stones to pour down from ceiling cavities, and so on. Some of 
these spells were apparently cast by mages Olothontor aided during his 
travels.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here's
 one of the more mundane magics that Olothontor uses to defend himself 
when attacked in the desert or in his lair. When resting far from home, 
rivermouth gravel bars and quarries are his favorite haunts because of 
this spell.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Pebble Wind<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evocation [Air]</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level: </b>Sor/Wiz 3</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Components: </b>V</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Effect:</b> 20-ft.-radius spread</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Duration:</b> 1 round</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> See text</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No (see text)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As <i>gust of wind</i>, except as noted above and as follows.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Instead
 of a path of wind, you create a whirling mass of air. The whirlwind 
carries sand, dirt, and other small objects (nothing heavier than a 
chicken egg) into the air, creating an opaque cloud of debris. Creatures
 must succeed at Fortitude saves as described in <i>gust of wind</i> to avoid being checked or moved by the spell. Creatures blown over or moved by the wind are pushed in a random direction.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 flying debris causes 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level 
(maximum 10d4); this damage is subject to damage reduction and creatures
 are allowed a Reflex save for half damage. If the debris is primarily 
composed of soft or very small objects, the spell deals 1d4 hit points 
per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d4). The spell deals damage to objects 
within the spread, though hardness will usually negate this damage, and 
can scour paint from walls and signs if small hard particles (such as 
sand) comprise the debris.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Olothontor's Fate</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 just a matter of time before someone thinks he has music and magic 
enough to enter the lair of the Minstrel Wyrm and destroy Olothontor. 
Right or wrong, any extensive battle might wreck the lair (and even rend
 Mount Araddyn, if hotrock flows begin), ending the peaceful existence 
of the blue dragon who loves music. If Olothontor survives and seeks 
revenge, Waterdeep itself could suffer -- or the High Road could become 
impassable until adventuring might is whelmed in earnest and the 
Minstrel Wyrm is destroyed. Claugiyliamatar, the aggressive Dragon of 
Kryptgarden Forest (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=fr/fx20020227wn">a green wyrm</a>)
 reportedly confronted Olothontor in midair on one occasion, but the 
blue dragon simply ignored her, continuing on his way. Not quite daring 
to attack so calmly superior a dragon, Claugiyliamatar circled away but 
by all accounts was enraged, spending hours in a shrieking, tail-lashing
 shredding of trees and grassy hillsides. She might well do just about 
anything to bring down Olothontor if the opportunity presents itself in 
the future.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Certainly
 the Minstrel Wyrm places himself far more at risk from attacks than 
most blue wyrms of his age, solely through his love of music. His 
listening forays may yet bring him to grief, as he crouches silently 
somewhere enjoying music, well within range of hostile poisoned javelins
 and blades or spells seeking the doom of a certain tune-smitten blue 
dragon. On the other hand, Olothontor might not regard such a death as a
 bad way to die, if die he must -- for not even dragons have learned the
 secrets of forever enjoying life as they did when youthful.</span></p>
