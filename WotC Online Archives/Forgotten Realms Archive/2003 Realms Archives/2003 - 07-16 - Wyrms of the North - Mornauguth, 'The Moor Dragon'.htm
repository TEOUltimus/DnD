 young adult green dragon is known, to those who pass or dwell near the 
Misty Forest, to lair to the northeast, in an area of steep-sided, 
breakneck wooded ravines. She preys on the wild deer that roam the High 
Moor. Occasionally she spices her diet with a caravan or adventuring 
band or two, and once a month or so takes wing eastward, disappearing 
for a tenday at a time. Though adventurers have more than once searched 
for the Moor Dragon's lair, they've never found any treasure. In 
reality, Mornauguth is a human transformed, trapped in green dragon 
shape by rivals. She was once a priestess of Shar -- young, pretty, and 
possessed of almost reckless ambition. She rose swiftly through the 
ranks of a temple to the Mistress of the Night located in the backlands 
of Amn, making many enemies along the way. Some of her rivals within the
 clergy wove dark spells that bound Mornauguth into dragon form -- 
whereupon she was attacked by a real dragon into whose lair she'd been 
lured before transformation. She slew that wyrm, though she was sorely 
wounded. To this day, Mornauguth seeks two things: revenge on those who 
transformed her and recovery of her true form through the grace of Shar.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">In
 hopes that the goddess will grant her human form, Mornauguth gives all 
the wealth she gains to the Dark Embrace temple in Amn, and she flies 
off at least once a month to perform some daring dark deed (usually a 
raid on a city's palace, jail, or state building) in the name of Shar.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">On
 rare occasions, clergy from the Dark Embrace request Mornauguth's 
service as a steed or aid in an attack on a strong target (usually a 
Selûnite temple), and she has thus far given it willingly. How long she 
continues to do so without any sign of Shar's favor remains to be seen.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Morna
 Auguth was a brilliant but willful child. From her earliest days she 
fought with those in authority whom she -- accurately, if not prudently 
-- saw as dolts. She grew up as a wild, thieving runaway in the southern
 backlands of Amn, living on her wits, daring, agility, and (whenever 
caught) her beauty, until she was captured by a priest of Shar to be his
 personal slave. This clergyman, Ablaer the Dark Goad, intended to cut 
out Morna's tongue and blind her once he'd tired of her. He put her in 
the kitchens of the Dark Embrace to work out her days as a drudge. After
 several years of servitude, Morna duped Ablaer's superior into 
believing that the Dark Goad of the Embrace was organizing a coup within
 the temple, and she had the great satisfaction of seeing her cruel 
overmaster maimed and broken by temple torturers. Ablaer was a long time
 dying, and Morna whispered words of triumphant hatred over his helpless
 form for all the long days of his torment.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">She
 found, however, that she'd merely traded one cruel master for another, 
when Ablaer's superior, the Coroanim Belvim Natrather, took her as his 
own plaything. Morna swiftly came to see that she now stood in the 
shadow of an additional peril: all Dark Embrace clergy considered her a 
treacherous informant. Every one of them took delight in wounding or 
mistreating her whenever they could find her alone. Morna began looking 
for a way out.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Her
 opportunity to escape presented itself within a year, when the Coroanim
 journeyed to a smaller, hidden Sharran temple in eastern Amn. Moondown 
House was a monastic community founded in the crumbling remnants of an 
old keep near Torbold. Its small but fervent priesthood were planning 
bloody night raids on the temples of all other gods in Amn, and they 
were training jaded, outlaw, and homeless youths into a fanatical strike
 force, the Slayers of Shar. The Coroanim wanted this force to become 
his own personal "Bringers of the Purge." He came with the might of his 
rank in long service to Shar, and the mustered magic of twenty-odd 
senior priests of the Embrace, to persuade the Dolorim of the House to 
submit to the authority of the Coroanim and make Moondown House a 
chapterhouse of the Dark Embrace.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 folk of Moondown were outraged but dared not show it. Their eldest 
clergy made a desperate plan to bring down the Coroanim and his most 
senior priests by means of slow-acting, subtle poisons -- knowing they 
faced almost certain discovery and painful death. Morna (sent by her 
master to spy on them) saw this as a golden chance for revenge, 
resolving to make the poisonings so frequent and widespread that the 
entire party from the Embrace would succumb before any confrontation 
could occur. Without telling anyone, she set about her plan, letting 
herself be seen at work by the elder Moondown clergy. When all the folk 
of the Embrace lay dead, Morna presented herself to the Moondown 
priests, saying she'd been guided by Shar herself in what she'd done.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Grateful
 and impressed, the Moondown priests adopted Morna into their ranks, 
immediately testing her by giving her the task of making Morna's former 
colleagues into zombies under her command and directing them to carry 
out the dirty drudge jobs of life in a monastery. Morna accepted the 
dung-shoveling, floor-scrubbing, and gardening without demur. Over the 
seasons that followed, she practiced iron self-control, always doing and
 saying the right thing, rising steadily in rank and influence within 
the Moondown clergy.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Some
 years later, disease claimed two senior priests. Almost immediately 
thereafter, a dispute with adventurers resulted in the death of one of 
the most powerful priestesses of the House. Moondown erupted into a 
frenzy of intrigues, confrontations, and stabbings in dark corridors. 
Morna was careful to keep her tongue still and her zombies close, using 
them to defend her from several murder attempts. Once many of the clergy
 had fallen, she emerged from her seclusion to challenge and slay her 
chief remaining rival, assuming the office of Prioress, third in rank 
over all the House.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Many
 ambitious priestesses who found themselves suddenly beneath her were 
furious. Morna survived no less than a dozen attempts to slay her over 
the year that followed. The tendency of stone blocks to fall from the 
walls of the ever-growing temple whenever she walked below became a wry 
joke among Morna and the novices, but she openly struck down two 
revealed conspirators in a spelltold battle, and she was widely (and 
correctly) believed to have caused the drowning of a third rival in the 
monastery cesspool. Morna's superiors eventually tired of the drain on 
Moondown resources and ordered that all hostilities cease -- upon pain 
of death. There were grumblings, but almost immediately the monastery 
found itself locked in all-out war with clergy of Selûne who'd moved 
into the area. Moondown House was badly damaged, and many of its clergy 
fled and were forced to adopt a roving lifestyle of striking at foes and
 then fleeing. Upland Amn became one large battlefield (certain bored 
merchants in Athkatla began to wager over who would prevail), and Morna 
became a feared warleader. She was so successful that her Moondown 
rivals feared that when the struggle ended in a Sharran victory (as all 
true followers of Shar knew it would), Morna Auguth would rule Moondown 
House.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">They
 could find nothing strong enough to use against her -- until a local 
told them the location of a dragon's lair. Guldarath was a very old 
black dragon, his scales tinged purple with age, who slept for decades 
at a time. He always awakened ravenously hungry and flew east to the 
rolling plains beyond Thay where vast herds of wild beasts roamed, 
awaiting his devouring jaws. Usually he over-ate, then flew ponderously 
and sleepily home again to return to long, shining, and memory-studded 
dreams.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">When
 Morna's band happened to be near the lair, one of its priestesses 
daringly awakened the dragon at dusk by hurling spells at its very nose.
 Guldarath awakened, too groggy to reflect on what had awakened him, and
 flew off to feed. The Moondown priestess hurried back to Morna's 
encamped band to say she'd found a cave she'd played in as a child, one 
that would serve as an admirable stronghold for them -- and that it was 
full of heaped treasure.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">That
 last news aroused the Moondown clergy, and even the reluctant and 
suspicious Morna couldn't keep them camped any longer in the damp hollow
 they'd retreated to in the face of strong and well-armed Selûnite 
warbands. Guided by the treacherous priestess, they reached the lair. 
Morna was suspicious, judging it the abode of a living dragon who'd 
return to entrap and doom them all, and went off by herself to hide in 
the deepest reaches of the dungeon, in the dextral of two passages she 
thought too small for any dragon to traverse. That played into the hands
 of the traitor, who had a confederate cast a fiery spell at the back of
 the passage once Morna had fallen asleep.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 sleepy Prioress scrambled out of the passage to get away from whatever 
danger lay behind her -- straight into a spell-ambush launched by her 
own clergy. Paralyzed and spellbound, Morna Auguth was forced into the 
shape of a green dragon by means of a powerful and little-known spell, 
and that magic was lengthened and strengthened by the spells of no less 
than fourteen priestesses. While she kept her memories and skills (and 
feats), she gained the form and abilities of her new dragon form.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mornauguth
 still hunts those same clergy members today, seeking to compel each one
 to remove her binding before she devours them. At the time, she was 
powerless to prevent them from fleeing, trailing mocking laughter. She 
was left alone to await the return of the owner of the treasure beneath 
her, knowing that he could only perceive her presence as a domain 
challenge.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Her
 paralysis ended scant moments before Guldarath appeared. A battle 
erupted that shook the very mountain around the true wyrm and the 
transformed priestess. Too startled to draw back down the narrow way and
 let fly with spells from a distance, the ancient black dragon pounced 
with jaws and fangs, and magic crackled between them as they struggled 
wing to wing and scale to scale in the dimness.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Morna
 knew she was fighting for her life, not coins or a cave to hold them, 
and she cared not if she ruined the lair or buried the hoard. As the two
 dragons rolled over and over, clawing and biting, lashes of her tail 
brought down many daggerlike rocks onto her foe, battering him and 
ultimately breaking his back. Mercilessly she carved and cooked the 
agonized black dragon, until Guldarath died atop his own hoard. Then she
 turned to hunt the Moondown clergy who'd trapped her into this battle. 
She found none that night, or the next day. Over the months that 
followed, however, she took a heavy toll of Sharran faithful, driven by 
rage and fear of being trapped forever in dragon form.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Self-control
 has returned to Morna over the years. Rage still smolders in her heart,
 but she has begun to use her new dragon form to greater effect. 
Mornauguth retains her human spellcasting ability rather than that of a 
green dragon. She is much heartened that Shar continues to grant her 
magic.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 spell that entrapped her gave Morna the breath weapon and other 
physical capabilities of a green dragon, and over the years she has 
grown accustomed to her dragon body. She can even prowl stealthily now; 
her thirst for secrets and knowing what's happening in the land often 
drives her to go creeping up to campfires by night to listen in on 
intrigues. More than one sleepy merchant stumbling into the woods to 
find tent, trail, or privy has had the -- sometimes final -- fright of 
his life upon stumbling over the snout of a glitter-eyed green dragon, 
waiting still, silent. and terrible in the night.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">From
 such nocturnal eavesdropping, Mornauguth often learns routes and 
timings of livestock drives and herd hunts -- so she can help herself to
 such abundant food, often under the nose of a dragon whose domain she's
 poaching on. She's wise enough not always to dine in one locale, which 
would result in drovers avoiding that area or adventuring bands being 
hired en masse to deal with her. She knows the backlands of Amn better 
than most living beings, and she has a shrewd overview of Sword Coast 
caravan shipping. She dislikes the sea and being spotted while over it 
by one of the wyrms she has seen flying offshore. When she contemplates 
fighting above waves she could be dragged into, true fear colors the 
Moor Dragon's thoughts for she knows that her aquatic ability is less 
refined than those of native water-dwellers. While exploring, she was 
once surprised by a dragon turtle that shot its neck up to bite her, 
almost pitching her under the waves -- where she would have been truly 
in its clutches.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">According
 to the sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate, the Moor Dragon's relationships 
with other wyrms have been "a series of skirmishes between a reckless, 
ambitious interloper who cares for treasure only as a means to further 
her schemes, and wyrms defending hoard and domain in the traditional 
sense." Though Velsaert dismisses reports of the Moor Dragon actually 
hiring adventurers to aid her, these reports are true: From time to 
time, to accomplish a daring raid on the foes of Shar, Mornauguth hires 
established bands of adventurers to carry out diversionary attacks or 
take-what-they-can raids.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Her
 chief agent in such dealings is Temrojan Kalnar, an old, retired wine 
merchant, with no friends and fewer scruples, who dwells on a walled 
farm northwest of Crimmor. The two can signal each other with <i>sending stones</i>
 placed by Mornauguth (who seized them from a caravan some years ago), 
but the Moor Dragon often arrives unannounced, or creeps near Kalnar's 
farm of nights, using her spells to spy on her agent -- whom she trusts 
about as far as he could throw her, tail and all. . . .</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mornauguth
 has always swung between a shrewd biding and a bold recklessness that 
sees her time and again plunge instantly into action to take advantage 
of opportunity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Mornauguth's Lair</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 Moor Dragon lairs in the broken country of the northeastern High Moor, 
due east from Daggerford and southeast of Secomber, in "the Rockshaws," a
 trackless region of sharp stony ridges and narrow, deep gullies linking
 springs with small cauldron lakes and sinkholes. The Rockshaws has 
acquired a colorful reputation as the home of many ghosts and much 
buried treasure. If one believes the bards, every thief or doomed 
dwarven treasury-guard in the North has headed for the Rockshaws as fast
 as possible under the weight of their loot, to bury it where monsters 
roam and inquisitive folk with shovels are thus few. Leucrotta and galeb
 duhr have always inhabited the Rockshaws, but other beasts come and go.
 Mornauguth hasn't bothered to seek out whatever treasures may lie in 
the Rockshaws, but a steady stream of wary dwarves armed with maps 
suggests at least some hidden gold lies there.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mornauguth
 dwells in extensive caverns beneath Greenleaf Vale, at the bottom of a 
wide, deep shaft (thought by some local gnomes to be an ancient delve 
rather than a natural feature). This "well" reaches the surface in the 
heart of a large stand of old trees in the Rockshaws. The Vale of thick 
oak, walnut, maple, and chestnut trees was so named by exploring elves 
because they entirely fill a deep bowl valley, and to a traveler on the 
ground are invisible until one stands almost on the lip of one of the 
cliff-walls of the valley. Many incautious adventurers have fallen to 
their deaths (or to sudden, grievous injury) by blundering right over 
the edge of a Vale wall in the dark; local leucrotta have been known to 
deliberately chase foes toward the Vale, trying to force them into a 
fall on the rocks. Several small, winding trails make perilous journeys 
down the Vale walls, where the overgrown ruins of several long-abandoned
 cottages can be seen.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">One
 old bardic ballad claims that Roadaeron, an exiled king of Westgate, in
 the days when that city had kings, dwelt here in hiding for almost 
forty years, raising his son Blaervaer to be king. The elderly Roadaeron
 laid down his life storming the city to put Blaervaer on the throne. 
The ballad claims (truthfully, according to Elminster) that Blaervaer 
stole away from his throne when he'd grown old (his latter days 
embittered by the vicious struggles among his four sons for the throne),
 leaving his crown behind, and fixed up one of the ruined cottages with 
his own hands, to spend his last few years gardening, reading, and 
talking with the few elves and mages who knew of his excellent parsnip 
wine and longsighted conversation.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mornauguth
 lies in her caverns only when she needs to take shelter from fierce 
wintry weather, or when wounded. Sometimes she prays to Shar, rocketing 
up the shaft to soar at the stars and cry out to the goddess -- but 
otherwise she is to be found elsewhere, spying on the doings of others 
or basking on high mountain ledges around Amn, plotting.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 lair itself is said to be little more than a long sleeping mound of 
smooth sand, gathered from the sandbars washed into the cavern by 
several springs that traverse them. The water of the springs, according 
to the Harper explorer Morlden "Silentboots," is sweet, cold, and 
drinkable. Morlden saw no guardians, treasure, nor constructions of any 
kind; if he'd not daringly used a spying-spell to see Mornauguth dig up 
her <i>sending stone</i> from the sand and then lie down for slumber, 
he'd not have been able to say for certain if a dragon really laired in 
the large cavern farthest in from the bottom of the shaft at all. He 
stresses that other items might well lie buried in the bed of sand, 
which is at least 6 feet deep in all places.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Mornauguth's Domain</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mornauguth
 seems to ignore the very concept of draconic territory, never defending
 her own lair or caring if she offends other wyrms by her roamings. Only
 fear of being caught over water curtails her wanderings, which are 
concerned with the doings of the Sharran clergy, rival priesthoods, and 
other human intrigues, and are broken by hunting trips and explorative 
forays far afield.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Mornauguth's
 domain, if one means which areas she'll defend against draconic foes, 
would seem to be the Sharran temples of Faerûn (Amn in particular).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>The Deeds of Mornauguth</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 Moor Dragon's life is devoted to winning back the favor of Shar, 
thereby regaining her human shape. If she has her druthers, however, 
she'll end up with the ability to change from human to dragon and back 
again at will, and live armored in the unfolding fondness of the 
Mistress of Night as a special agent of the goddess (with special powers
 to match). Several recent successes have given Mornauguth cause for 
quickening hope; Shar seems to have her eye on the dragon that worships 
her at last.</span></p>
