<table border="0" width="570" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">A century ago, the huge emerald dragon known as "the 
"Silent Shadow" could be seen at well-nigh every important event in the 
Sword Coast North -- gliding overhead, just watching. He never spoke 
(hence his sobriquet) and ignored most attempts to hail or attack him, 
serenely observing from an aloof distance and flying away when 
challenged -- but otherwise "always there" and missing nothing. Some 
barbarians thought him a "watching spirit" who reported to their own 
totem spirits or to strange gods; some sages and mages considered him a 
spy in service to some sinister cabal -- a belief encouraged by false 
confirmations announced by several sorcerous brotherhoods seeking to 
impress others. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In truth, Raulothim served only himself. He loved riding
 the high winds so prevalent over the North, and he hated missing 
anything. The Silent Shadow didn't care if he misinterpreted what he saw
 or never learned the reasons or forces behind the events he witnessed 
-- he just hated feeling left out (and hence, lonely). </p>
<p align="LEFT">The years changed him, however, as years change all 
beings. These days, the great emerald wyrm called Raulothim seems more a
 statue than a gliding shadow. He spends long days lying motionless and 
gazing out over the North from the lip of his lair in the Pit of Stars, 
the cauldron of an extinct volcano (known to the Netherese as Xardmount)
 on the rocky island of Axard, the north-easternmost isle of Ruathym. 
The pit is named for the many blobs of volcanic glass -- white, clear, 
and smoke-hued -- that line its walls and gleam in the sun like so many 
gigantic cabochon-cut gems. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The events that made Raulothim so thoughtful began with 
his chance encounter with a ship that sailed the skies. The ship's 
spelljamming crew were seeking to hide treasure on the "uninhabited" 
outer islets of Ruathym. When they found their treasure-burying efforts 
watched over by a silently attentive emerald dragon of monstrous size, 
some of that crew fled through a <i>portal</i> they opened into another 
plane. Those sights shattered what the Silent Shadow thought he knew of 
the world. Frankly, it scared him. </p>
<p align="LEFT">How many hidden realms -- and folk watching Toril from 
them -- are there? Who are these watchers, and what are their aims? How 
many mages who can open such <i>portals</i> serve masters on those 
hidden worlds? Can these wizards call on magical aid from their hidden 
masters? Did the ship's crew guess at his own innocence? Or do they 
consider him an agent working with a rival of theirs? </p>
<p align="LEFT">Pondering such questions, Raulothim sits and broods, 
mastering all the magic he can. Thus, Raulothim silently waits for the 
day someone who thinks he knows too much of such things seeks to slay 
him. Sometimes he steals forth to mages' towers, hoping to find no one 
home, a ruin to be plundered, or the owner weakened . . . so he can 
steal more magic. He's even been known to tear apart wizards' tombs, 
using deft lashes of his tail (and boulders dropped from high aloft) to 
trigger and yet avoid guardian spel1s by keeping clear of their ranges. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In Ruathym, little is known about the Wyrm of Axard 
beyond the bare rumors that his past was a far more active and colorful 
affair than his life today, and that he guards some of the mightiest 
magic in all Faerûn. It's also widely reported that the gigantic emerald
 dragon enjoys hurling spells at those who come too close to his island 
home. In truth, Raulothim is terrified by how vulnerable his relatively 
puny magical skills leave him in the face of all these deadly foes. He 
has therefore set about accumulating the most puissant battle spells and
 most potent magic items he can find and seize, including things beyond 
his powers -- if they're hidden where only he knows, they can't fall 
into the wrong hands and be used against him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim currently commands some four hundred 
battle-related spells, and he can use about three hundred of them (the 
most useful lower-level spells). He has accumulated thousands upon 
thousands of coins (to purchase spells he can't gain any other way) and 
many magic items. Magic items useful in battle he keeps at hand; the 
others he buries with the coins (beneath tons of gravel at the bottom of
 the Pit, which rests atop an incredibly hard volcanic "plug" that 
effectively prevents anyone tunneling up into it from beneath without 
the Silent Shadow getting lots of warning of their slow, laborious 
progress), for possible later use trading for magic he desires.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim's collection of battleworthy magic items is known to include <i>rods of flailing</i> and <i>lordly might</i>, a <i>mace of smiting</i>, a <i>staff of power</i> and two <i>staves of evocation</i>; four <i>wands of fireball</i>, three <i>wands of ice storm</i>, and at least one each of <i>wands of lightning bolt</i>, <i>hold monster</i>, and <i>baleful polymorph</i>, as well as a <i>javelin of lightning</i>, a ring that can unleash one <i>dispel magic</i> and two <i>reverse gravity</i>
 spells per day, and several magic swords. Most of these are concealed 
at various "ready" locations around Axard and are guarded against 
unauthorized use by guardian spells and by their being engraved with 
false command words that cause them to strike at (rather than obeying) 
the utterer. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim makes extensive use of a spell that enables 
him to animate wands to "float and fire" at his command (that is, hang 
in midair, aim, and discharge remotely). He uses the <i>staff of power</i>
 and a few wands to so guard his lair, and he carries other wands with 
him in a neck-sack for use in any duel he may have to fight (usually 
setting them to "float and fire" at a foe from one direction, while he 
attacks from another). The Wyrm of Axard always wears a ring -- or 
rather, always wears a plain brass ring; some sages believe he 
possesses, and alternates, several magical rings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Volo's notes indicate that Raulothim has visited a Mage 
Fair (in disguise). The dragon was fascinated by what he saw, terrified 
at being surrounded by so many folk who could destroy him with a few 
gestures, and reassured that not all mages in Faerûn were part of some 
vast conspiracy to rule the world together. The sometime tour guide of 
the Realms a1so found written references to the Silent Shadow being seen
 overhead at a minor battle fought somewhere in the Dessarin valley in 
1211 DR. Elminster found no earlier mention of the wyrm, but he did 
uncover the surprising news that Raulothim has traded, down the years, 
with the Taerserr family of halflings in Holgerstead -- exchanging large
 and detailed maps of his own making (scratched on great slabs of Axard 
rock) in return for items of minor magic (such as lanterns whose 
shuttered interiors hold stones on which <i>continual flame</i> spells 
have been cast, potions of healing, and so on). By all accounts, the 
dragon is an exacting and thorough cartographer of the Sword Coast 
North; Blucklo Taerserr's recent "Drawn by a dragon!" claims were hardly
 necessary to sell the table-sized maps to lordlings, Waterdhavian 
nobles, and merchants wealthy enough to mount them on the walls of their
 feast halls -- or upon actual tables.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim is also a collector of words of activation and
 magical command phrases (of which he has swift and excellent recall). 
He's currently engaged in using <i>crystal balls</i>, some having powers of <i>detect thoughts</i> or <i>clairaudience</i>,
 to spy on active adventuring bands so that he can learn their true 
natures. Raulothim believes he needs to find adventurers capable and 
formidable in both intrigue and combat, who above all will be loyal to 
him. He'll sponsor them (and, if need be, aid them with magic and his 
own fighting abilities) as they carry out a task that is likely to 
consume their lives: exploring the <i>portals</i> Raulothim has heard 
about, finding and guarding any such portals near his lair, and devising
 some method of watching over all known gates for invasions by 
potentially deadly foes. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Silent Shadow is aware that several adventuring 
bands will be necessary to replace the inevitable casualties of age and 
combat -- and that for his own protection, it's best if he somehow keeps
 the bands from learning of each other (both to keep them from joining 
forces against him and to prevent any mind-reading menace from learning 
of one group from captive members of another). Raulothim knows of 
several baelnorn who watch over portals near the sanctums they guard -- 
and wonders if he can bargain with such beings to have them monitor a 
farscrying network of "gatewatch" magics.</p>
<p align="LEFT">He deems such a watch urgently necessary. His own fleeting and sporadic examinations of <i>portals</i>
 have shown the Wyrm of Axard heavily armed creatures of many strange 
races furtively emerging from, and disappearing into, these <i>portals</i>
 to other worlds. Raulothim worries that Toril may already be a place of
 arms-storage and weapons-practice for "creatures from elsewhere," and 
that an unguarded Faerûn may someday, without warning, become a wasted 
battleground between warring forces from elsewhere . . . someday all too
 soon. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Silent Shadow's relations with other dragons have 
been, according to the dragon expert Velsaert of Baldur's Gate, "a 
series of avoidances, flights from even friendly overtures, and deadly 
defenses of his lair." Raulothim has never mated and shows no interest 
in doing so. His paranoia rules him as surely as a tyrant master, 
although he's willing to accept allies (such as the baelnorn) under 
clearly defined conditions, and there seems no reason why a dragon could
 not be an ally. It should be noted that "allies" to Raulothim are 
beings who dwell at a safe distance and don't come calling unannounced. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Raulothim's Lair</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Silent Shadow dwells in a large, labyrinthine cave 
network opening off the ledge above the Pit of Stars where he likes to 
sprawl. These caverns bristle with traps. Most are <i>explosive runes</i>
 and similar spells, some placed on false spellbooks, and the lair also 
sports caverns not used by the dragon that feature falling-block traps 
to doom unwanted intruders.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim's lair is also defended by magically animated 
automatons: creatures controlled by his various magic items. Reports of 
these servitors identify them as golems, gargoyles, or other flying 
creatures made of "living stone," as well as stationary menaces that 
resemble the stones of the landscape until approached too closely. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Pit of Stars is the lone true lair of the Silent 
Shadow, but the emerald dragon has eight or more "sleeping perches" 
(high mountain ledges sheltered by overhangs, from which he often has to
 chase roosting peryton or even wyverns) on various islets up and down 
the northerly Sword Coast. At least one of these perches leads to a 
hidden cavern where the dragon caches magic items and spellbooks, in 
case his main lair should ever be despoiled or destroyed. </p>
<p align="LEFT">It should be noted that Raulothim duplicated many of his
 most important spells by means of a magic, animated quill pen (possibly
 of Netherese or Myth Drannan origin) that traced magical writings and 
then reproduced them exactly . . . a pen that crumbled to dust decades 
ago when its magic was exhausted. He hopes, of course, to someday find 
another. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim is willing to allow mages to copy his spells 
for their personal use, so long as they also make "second" copies for 
him -- or would be willing, if he could only find a way to trust wizards
 or guard against what he sees as their inevitable betrayal. He has 
found mention of a <i>bloodfire</i> spell used by an elven mage in Myth 
Drannor who took on human apprentices and protected himself by means of 
this magic. The spell required the recipient to willingly accept the 
spell, which would remain quiescent for years, defying all attempts to 
remove it -- until the caster, by a single act of will, either dismisses
 the spell without harm or causes the spell recipient's blood to boil 
and burst into flame, immolating him from within. According to the 
records Raulothim discovered, <i>bloodfire</i> was used twice against 
the mage's treacherous apprentices. The mage married a third apprentice 
-- and one of their half-elven daughters disappeared with the spell 
after her parents died together in a chain reaction disaster of 
activated magic items that blasted them, and the top of the tall, 
slender stone tower they shared, to nothingness. Raulothim has been 
unable to find any trace of spell or daughter, one Maerithlee 
Ieirmitarym.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For obvious reasons, Elminster notes, many archmages 
would value this spell highly. "Reluctance to trust" is a condition 
afflicting most dragons and accomplished wizards; almost all of them 
would use this spell if they could gain access to it -- and many are so 
tormented by their loneliness that they'd pay large sums to acquire a 
demonstrably effective copy of <i>bloodfire</i> (thought to be an 8th- 
or 9th-level wizard spell). "Oh, that I could trust enough to love," the
 character of the wizard Golothmiir cries out at the climax of the 
famous play <i>Argonyar in Amn</i> -- a scene that has moved many a mage to tears.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A heavily guarded lair passage leads to a cavern where 
the Silent Shadow is preparing to create a copy of himself . . . if he 
can ever successfully modify a stolen copy of the <i>stasis clone</i> spell used by Manshoon of the Zhentarim. To even begin to do so, Raulothim knows he'll need a <i>helm of supreme wizardry</i>,
 which allows use of spells beyond the normal abilities of a wearer. 
He's read about these helms in several diaries of humans who learned 
spellcraft in Myth Drannor but he hasn't yet located one. Still, he 
can't believe they were all destroyed in the fall of that fair city. 
(Indeed, the very next wyrm we'll visit in these pages, 
Saryndalaghlothtor, owns such a helm.) </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Raulothim's Domain </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Silent Shadow largely ignores the concept of a 
domain, though he defends the island of Axard as one. He considers 
himself free to roam all Toril if he deems it necessary, but he is well 
aware of other dragons' territorial claims -- and that it's best to 
escape their notice entirely by avoiding their domains. </p>

succeed on a DC 37 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+21
 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon 
moves off. If Raulothym chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a 
normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each 
round if they don't escape. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b> Whenever Raulothym 
attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature in a 360-foot radius 
that has 38 or fewer HD must make a DC 37 Will save. Failure indicates 
that the creature is panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it has 4 or fewer HD) 
or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or more HD).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Psionics:</b> At will -- <i>object reading;</i> 3/day -- <i>augmented invisibility, clairaudience/clairvoyance, control sound, fog cloud, nondetection, shield of prudence.</i>
 Manifester level 19th; save DC 1d20 + power level + key ability 
modifier. Raoulothym manifests powers as if he were a psion with 
Clairsentience as his primary discipline.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tail Sweep (Ex):</b> Raulothym can sweep with his 
tail as a standard action. The sweep affects Small or smaller creatures 
in a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet extending from an intersection
 on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Each potentially 
affected creature in the area takes 2d6+21 points of damage (Reflex DC 
37 half).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Raulothym can see four times as
 well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal 
light. He also has darkvision to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Planar Travel (Su):</b> Raulothym has the innate ability to pass instantly between the Material Plane and the Inner Planes.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Raulothim's Magic</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are a pair of battle spells drawn from the Silent 
Shadow's ever-growing collection. The second spell is a modification of 
one known to be in use by human wizards in Neverwinter decades ago; 
several nondraconic variants of it may well be in circulation. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forcebarb<br></b>Evocation [Force]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3 <br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) <br><b>Effect:</b> 1 force object<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level <br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="LEFT">You create a cylindrical glowing beam of force 10 feet long and 3 feet in diameter. One end of the <i>forcebarb</i>
 is a hook, while the other end is capped in a 5-foot-diameter sphere. 
It cannot be created to appear within a creature or solid object, though
 it is sufficient to occupy a 10 foot by 5 foot by 5 foot area (as if it
 were a creature with a space dimension equal to this amount). The 
forcebarb is immobile and sheds light as a candle.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A creature that touches the forcebarb or passes through 
the area it occupies must save or be stunned for 1 round and take 1d6 
points of electricity damage per caster level (a successful save avoids 
the stunning but still deals half damage; maximum 10d6).</p>
<p align="LEFT">A <i>shield</i> spell that contacts a forcebarb is 
dispelled instantly if its caster level is less than yours, at no harm 
to the forcebarb. A forcebarb automatically destroys any <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i>
 effect whose area contacts it, destroying both the opposing spell and 
itself harmlessly in a spectacular burst of colored lights. Greater 
versions of these spells (such as <i>greater dispelling</i> or <i>globe of invulnerability</i>) negate a <i>forcebarb</i> instantly but are not destroyed by doing so.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shimmermantle<br></b>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 4 <br><b>Components:</b> V <br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range: </b>Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> Up to 10 minutes/level or until discharged (see text)</p>
<p align="LEFT">You create a shimmering aura that protects you from 
attacks, both physical and magical. While the spell lasts there is a 20%
 chance that any attack of harmful effect that might affect you fails to
 do so. This works just like a miss chance, except that it also applies 
to magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and 
supernatural abilities. When an area attack fails to affect you, its 
affects against other subjects remain unchanged. For example, a foe 
blasts you and your party with a <i>fireball</i> spell. There is a 20% chance that <i>shimmermantle </i>will
 protect you completely from the spell. If so, you take no damage from 
the fireball, but your companions gain no benefit at all.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of 
damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged. If an 
attack allows a save for reduced damage, roll a saving throw to 
determine how much damage <i>shimmermantle </i>prevented. When <i>shimmermantle </i>prevents a nondamaging attack from affecting you, the attack has an effective damage rating that you must deduct from the <i>shimmermantle's </i>protection.
 A nondamaging attack's effective damage is equal to its saving throw DC
 -10. For example, a carrion crawler's paralyzing touch (DC 13) counts 
as 3 points of damage, and a <i>command</i> spell from a Wisdom 11 
cleric (DC 11) is a 1-point attack. For weapon attacks that also have a 
nondamaging component, combine the actual damage and the effective 
damage. For example, a stunning attack from a 2nd-level monk with Wisdom
 16 (DC 14) counts as a 4-point attack, and if the monk's unarmed strike
 dealt 6 points of damage, the total damage deducted from the <i>shimmermantle</i> is 10 points. Likewise, a mummy dealing 13 points of damage with a slam also carries <i>mummy rot</i> (DC 16, for 6 point of effective damage) and drains 19 points from a <i>shimmermantle </i>spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Raulothim's Fate</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Silent Shadow seems to be a waiting, sitting target 
-- and this is deliberate: If adventuring bands and wizardly cabals come
 calling, they must do battle on his prepared ground. Most intruders 
notice the mound of gold coins and tumbled chests at the center of the 
Pit of Stars; a lure, of course. Raulothim dropped the treasure there 
because the Pit was once (before the last crumbling caldera walls fell 
away, leaving it open, as it is today) the lair of a powerful beholder. 
That eye tyrant is now an invisible doomsphere lurking deep in the Pit, 
awaiting intruders it can slay. </p>
<p align="LEFT">With the aid of his arsenal of magic items and such 
defenders as the doomsphere and his automatons, the Silent Shadow is 
known to have brought about the doom of two score formidable bands of 
attackers (including a dozen Zhentarim magelings who styled themselves 
the Robes of Doom, and the chartered adventuring companies of Bendever's
 Talons and The Bold Broadswords of Mirabar), as well as an unknown but 
large number of independent thieves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Raulothim commands items that can levitate the remains 
of fallen intruders away from the doomsphere for his leisurely 
examination, plundering, and then tasteful arrangement around the Pit as
 lures and decoys. (A favorite is a chest containing an explosive trap 
or cursed magic items, surrounded by the bodies of fallen adventurers, 
which the Silent Shadow pretends to defend fiercely.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Whether this dragon perishes under the attacks of 
treasure-seekers or the portal-hopping "overfoes" he so fears is 
anyone's guess, but if neither prevail over Raulothim in the next two 
decades, Elminster expects the emerald dragon to find a magical means of
 creating a <i>stasis clone</i> or otherwise prolonging his existence 
(such as lichdom). Though the Old Mage seems to admire the Silent 
Shadow's striving, Mystra's desire to have magic abroad in Faerûn rather
 than hoarded keeps her Chosen busy spreading rumors and treasure maps 
that bid fair to keep the Wyrm of Axard battling treasure-seekers often,
 until the day Raulothim is no more. </p>
