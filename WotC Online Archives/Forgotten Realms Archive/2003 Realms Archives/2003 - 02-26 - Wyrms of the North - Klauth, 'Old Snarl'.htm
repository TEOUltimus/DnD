<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2002-26%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Klauth,%20%27Old%20Snarl%27_files/dragon_244_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="233" width="186">The
 nasty brutality of this huge old red wyrm has become a watchword in the
 Sword Coast North, passing into common speech in such expressions as 
these: "Don't go near him early of mornings; he's apt to be a right 
Klauth until he's had a mug or two." Or, "Blood and bodies everywhere . .
 . it looked as though old Klauth himself had come calling!" Or the 
shorter variant (used to describe butchery): "Regular Klauth work!" The 
habitual facial expression of this much-scarred wyrm has won him the 
popular nickname of "Old Snarl." </p>
<p class="size2">Klauth is one of the largest and most fearsome red 
dragons ever to take wing in Faerûn. He spends his days brooding in grim
 suspicion or lashing out at other wyrms. Velsaert of Baldur's Gate (the
 sage now recognized as an authority on dragonkind up and down the Sword
 Coast), describes Klauth as "a grim, nasty, awe-strikingly huge red 
great wyrm who has slain many rivals in a career spent on the attack, 
aggressively mauling everyone within reach." </p>
<p class="size2">The sage speculates that Klauth is extremely paranoid 
and always fears that other dragons are rising to surpass him in power, 
while striking out at those he sees as rivals whenever he judges the 
time is right. Klauth has also been known to scatter armies, to land 
atop the orcs of a gathered horde and roll around (crushing thousands), 
and to swoop down without warning to topple wizards' towers with their 
owners inside. </p>
<p class="size2">Only his unpredictability and great might have kept 
Klauth from being the sort of menace that archmages band together to 
track down and destroy in what is known as a Great Hunt. (Such 
undertakings have been the fate of several titanic beasts in recent 
centuries, such as the Anglatha of Tulmon, a magically-altered captive 
deepspawn that disgorged only beholders.) Only threats that seem likely 
to reach out and menace Klauth -- principally other dragons -- are 
themselves endangered by the Old Snarl. </p>
<p class="size2">As his string of triumphs mounts, however, Klauth's 
reputation becomes ever darker, and he may soon become the subject of 
the first Great Hunt in over eighty years. At least one mage of note, 
Malchor Harpell, has called for Klauth's destruction after learning of 
the dragon's recent magic acquisitions. Klauth's response was to attack 
the Tower of Twilight, where the wyrm's massive bulk almost carried him 
through its defensive weblike fields of crisscrossing <i>lightning bolts</i>
 before their combined effects caused his muscles to spasm so 
uncontrollably that his heart faltered and he could no longer beat his 
wings to fly. It is reported that Klauth flung himself to one side, 
crashed to the ground in the meadow below the tower pond, rolled away 
into the trees, and clawed himself aloft again, fleeing before the 
wizard could send any spells after him. This sort of sudden attack and 
disappearance is typical of Klauth's fighting style. Although he prefers
 to slay any foe he fights, he is not above deferring the threat they 
pose by inflicting as much damage as he can at no cost to himself, then 
disappearing before his foe can respond. </p>
<p class="size2">Old Snarl isn't an unremitting destroyer of all he 
meets, however. He often obeys strange whims that lead him to acts of 
kindness or aid to creatures he doesn't think can harm him. One such 
recipient of this surprising charity was the elven sorceress Jhanandra, 
whom Klauth found weeping amid the ruins of an elven village she'd 
reached too late to defend against a brigand raid. In Jhanandra's arms 
was the only survivor of the attack, a dazed infant whose only kin dwelt
 in distant Evereska. The dragon flew both elves to Evereska cradled in 
his talons, "with a gentleness I'd hitherto known only from my own 
kind," Jhanandra reported. She described Klauth as having a huge bulk 
but graceful, supple movements, as if he were a hunting cat. His snout, 
head, and body were all covered in old, wicked-looking scars, where 
scales had been roughly torn away and had never grown back. Volo 
recorded the words of the sorceress but scoffed at her story. Elminster,
 however, sternly insists that the tale is true . . . and that the 
infant rescued that day is rising swiftly to greatness -- and might soon
 be known to Faerûn at large. </p>
<p class="size2">Klauth isn't known to have shown like kindnesses to 
other dragons. If he has ever mated, no one has taken note of it. Nor 
does he ever regard red she-wyrms with any visible romantic interest, 
though he did devour one once, in a roaring, cartwheeling midair 
struggle above the roofs of Mirabar. Spectators report that Klauth seems
 to have deliberately initiated the conflict to enhance his reputation 
across the North. </p>
<p class="size2">Klauth is said to possess the usual vanity of his kind,
 though adventurers have failed to play upon it to goad him into foolish
 acts; he seems too wise and controlled to allow pride to blind him to 
perils or lure him into traps. He is also said to allow himself no true 
friends or even, among dragons, acquaintances. His appearance in the sky
 sends most wyrms fleeing for cover as quickly as they can hurl 
themselves through the air. Thankfully for the general peace of the 
North, such appearances are few. </p>
<p class="size2">The key to Klauth's character could be his constant 
anticipation of potential dangers and the formation of carefully planned
 responses. Other wyrms might dream of past glories or future triumphs, 
but Old Snarl spends his time observing, judging potential rivals, and 
doing something about it. He's not above sneaking near a lair by 
nightfall and causing a rockslide to entomb a rival alive or literally 
stealing magic from another dragon like a stealthy thief in the night. 
Klauth is said to be accomplished in the arts of creeping around with 
incredible stealth and silence for a being so large. </p>
<p class="size2">He's also widely (and Elminster says, correctly) 
believed to hunt for and devour the eggs and hatchlings of all sorts of 
dragons -- except for red dragon eggs, which Klauth uses in a secret 
magical process to increase his size, health, and vigor. He seems an 
accomplished master in the art of tricking dragons out of their lairs 
(leaving offspring or eggs unguarded) so he can slip in and snatch away 
what he seeks. </p>
<p class="size2">On at least one memorable occasion, he failed in this 
task and was trapped in a cavern lair by its returning resident wyrm 
(the mist dragon Narnardinath, who dwelt in a Sword Coast shoreline 
cavern near the mouth of the Iceflow). Klauth brought down its roof to 
make his escape by deliberately ramming several natural stone pillars, 
shattering them with his bulk. The Bright Broadaxe, a band of 
adventurers from Neverwinter who'd crept into the cavern to explore, 
unaware that one dragon laired in the cave and another had stolen into 
it before them, witnessed the collapse that slew Narnardinath. It took 
them hours of clambering over the loose rubble that buried the mist 
dragon and his hoard to find the way the battered red dragon had taken 
to the freedom of open air. </p>
<p class="size2">Even Elminster is a trifle hazy over just how Klauth 
discovered how to use red dragon eggs to make himself more mighty, but 
he knows what spell the much-scarred red wyrm employs to do so: a 
Netherese spell named <i>Thellar's argauneau</i>, after the mage who 
devised it (an archsorcerer who delighted in "bettering" dragons with 
his experiments, over a long career that produced two-headed dragons and
 several more stable subspecies). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Klauth's Lair </b></p>
<p class="size2">Klauth was sorely wounded on the fourth day of Mirtul 
in the Year of the Turret, when he was ambushed by two white dragons and
 a blue dragon working together. The four wyrms engaged in a spectacular
 aerial battle that raged across the skies of the Sword Coast North from
 the lceflow to the Fell Pass. Though Klauth did slay all three of his 
attackers and wasted no time in seizing the hoard of the vanquished blue
 dragon Irdrithkryn, he then went into hiding. Elminster explains that 
according to an awed young apprentice mage who was practicing his <i>scrying</i>
 spells near Neverwinter, Old Snarl came out of that battle with one 
wing almost torn off and a great gaping hole in his side: almost half of
 his body had been frozen solid, shattered, and then struck away. </p>
<p class="size2">No one saw just where the crippled wyrm flew or the 
landing that almost slew him. Klauth used all of his hoarded and freshly
 seized magic to keep himself alive and to build a lair in which to hide
 away and heal. He chose a narrow, winding chasm in the mountains east 
of Raven Rock, which is an unnamed, isolated valley that he filled with 
sheep, goats, and rothe seized from all over the North. There he yet 
abides among his ready supply of food, building his strength and 
practicing his spells, and awaiting the day when he'll be powerful 
enough to sally forth as the unquestioned master of northern dragonkind.
 </p>
<p class="size2">That day might never come; Klauth has become a wyrm who
 sees rising rivals in every other dragon who has broken out of its egg 
-- and his paranoia is not soothed by the many monsters and adventurers 
who enter his valley to help themselves to the ready food. </p>
<p class="size2">From these intruders, however, Klauth has gained many 
magic items, among them several wands. By working on magic of his own 
and employing a key spell stolen from the hoard of desert dragon 
Iymrith, he has mounted the wands in his wings and established mental 
control over them so that he can trigger them as he flies. In this way 
he has surprised and slain a flying mage and two intruding dragons who 
were expecting to deal with only a red dragon's breath weapon and 
perhaps a spell or two. The bodies of the dragons are believed to lie 
where they crashed: in the depths of the tiny but very deep Orothryn's 
Well, which is a pond at the heart of Klauth's little valley. </p>
<p class="size2">Word of "Klauthen Vale" is now spreading across the 
North from the taverns of Mirabar, and adventurers may soon become a 
real headache for Klauth. His hoard is of legendary size, and folk say 
(accurately) that despite his advancing age, Old Snarl still leaves the 
valley from time to time to smite potential rivals and to search for the
 hoards of the two white dragons he slew in the great battle 
(Aerihykloarara and Ruuthundrarar, both of whom seem to have used 
several resting-caverns but who kept their treasure hidden elsewhere). </p>
<p class="size2">Klauthen Vale isn't known to have any traps or 
guardians beyond its famous owner (who is known to lie sometimes on a 
ledge high on one of its walls, from whence he can strike at intruders 
on the valley floor). The vale walls are broken by several natural 
caves, at least two of which are large enough for Klauth to shelter in. 
He keeps his hoard in a small, simple network of tunnels beneath one 
cavern. The only entrance to this subterranean complex is by lifting a 
huge slab of stone -- a task only creatures as large and as strong as 
dragons can easily manage. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Klauth's Domain </b></p>
<p class="size2">Klauth doesn't defend or patrol a territory the way 
many dragons do; he regards himself as free to roam wherever he desires 
on his rare forays out of his vale. This isn't to say he doesn't 
recognize that sightseeing over Waterdeep or Iymrith's desert city would
 be both dangerous and imprudent. He invades the domains of other 
dragons only for specific reasons and performs the tasks he sets for 
himself as quickly and as efficiently as possible. He acts not out of 
fear but out of the prudence that has become a foundation of his 
character. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Deeds of Klauth </b></p>
<p class="size2">Klauth spends most of his waking time scrying the world
 around him with his spells. He probably knows more about the deeds and 
whereabouts of surface-world creatures in the Sword Coast North than any
 other being alive today. Moreover, Old Snarl thinks more about what he 
sees than most who spy by means of magic; he's seldom looking for just 
one thing or person, and he has the wits (and experience in their use) 
to assess problems and reason them through without hesitation. Seeing 
carts being loaded with swords in one spot sends him looking for 
activity among armorers in all the places to which those carts could 
logically be headed. A mustering of forces in a merchant company 
compound or noble villa brings his full attention to bear upon the 
purpose of that activity and the potential results. </p>
<p class="size2">Klauth's expertise on the activities and behavior of 
others in the North is as formidable a weapon as the jets of fire and 
beams of magic that spurt forth from his wings as he swoops down on foes
 . . . almost. It also gives him something quite valuable to bargain 
with when dealing with foes he'd rather not challenge; Old Snarl is 
thought to have come to a "live and let live" agreement with Alustriel 
of the Seven in this manner. </p>

of the appropriate size as can fit under his body. Each potentially 
affected creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 40) or be pinned, 
automatically taking 4d8+25 points of bludgeoning damage on that round 
and each round thereafter that the character remains pinned.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> This ability takes 
effect automatically when Klauth attacks, charges, or flies overhead. It
 affects only opponents with 39 or fewer Hit Dice or levels within a 
radius of 360 feet. Each affected creature must make a successful Will 
save (DC 38) to resist the effect. On a failure, a creature with 5 or 
more Hit Dice or levels becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds, and a creature 
with 4 or fewer Hit Dice or levels becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds. 
Success indicates that the target is immune to Klauth's frightful 
presence for one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>12/day -- <i>locate object; </i>3/day -- <i>suggestion; </i>1/day -- <i>discern location, find the path.</i> Caster level 19th; save DC 18 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spells:</b> Klauth can cast spells as a 19th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep: </b>Klauth can sweep with his tail as a 
standard action. The sweep affects Medium-size or smaller creatures 
within a half-circle with a diameter of 40 feet, centered on his rear. 
The sweep automatically deals 2d8+25 points of bludgeoning damage 
(Reflex DC 40 half).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex): </b>Klauth can ascertain creatures 
by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing 
vibration and other environmental clues) to a range of 360 feet. 
Invisibility and darkness are irrelevant, though he still can't discern 
ethereal beings. He usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks 
to notice creatures within range of his blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Subtype: </b>Klauth is immune to fire damage, 
and he takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for half 
damage is allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and 
double damage on a failure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities: </b>Klauth is immune to fire, paralysis, and <i>sleep</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Low-Light Vision: </b>Klauth can see four times as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar low-light conditions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known </b>(6/8/8/8/8/7/7/7/7/4; save DC 18 + spell level): 0 -- <i>dancing lights, detect magic, disrupt undead, ghost sound, mage hand, mending, open/close, ray of frost, read magic; </i>1st -- <i>expeditious retreat, identify, mage armor, shield, true strike; </i>2nd -- <i>bull's strength, darkness, detect thoughts, Melf's acid arrow, web; </i>3rd -- <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance, haste, lightning bolt, vampiric touch; </i>4th -- <i>improved invisibility, scrying, solid fog, stoneskin;</i> 5th -- <i>Bigby's interposing hand, Mordenkainen's faithful hound, nightmare, wall of stone;</i> 6th -- <i>chain lightning, disintegrate, guards and wards; </i>7th -- <i>banishment, ethereal jaunt, prismatic spray;</i> 8th -- <i>maze, power word blind, protection from spells;</i> 9th -- <i>wail of the banshee, wish.</i></p>
<p class="size2">Klauth has used <i>wish</i> spells to remove spells he 
knows from his repertoire to make room for different ones, so his spells
 known tends to change seasonally.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i><i>Wand of magic missile</i> (9th level, 20 charges), <i>wand of lightning bolt</i> (8th level, 25 charges), <i>wand of ice storm</i> (7th level, 11 charges), <i>wand of fireballs</i> (8th level, 31 charges), <i>wand of polymorph other</i> (7th level, 16 charges), <i>wand of hold person</i> (10th level, 23 charges), <i>wand of dispel magic</i> (10th level, 13 charges), <i>ring of minor cold resistance</i>, <i>ring of wizardry II</i>, <i>ring of protection +5</i>.
 Klauth has many more magic items in his lair. If he is prepared for 
battle and has knowledge of his foes, he arms himself appropriately.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Klauth's Fate </b></p>
<p class="size2">Old Snarl is less likely to die by misadventure than 
most dragons. Enfeeblement (old age), disease, or a cabal of foes acting
 together are the dooms most likely to claim him. The last-mentioned 
cause would probably involve a titanic battle; the others might strike 
silently or might goad Klauth into one last grand, suicidal flight of 
destruction across the North. </p>
<p class="size2">In any case, once word spreads of the passing of Old 
Snarl, Klauthen Vale is likely to see a "gold rush" of adventurers 
hungry for wealth and mages hungry for magic like no other in the modern
 North. If even one of these seekers recovers an intact <i>triptych</i> 
spell, well . . . as Elminster has observed, "'Twill be a mite too late,
 then, for the traditional tactic of 'standing back and looking the 
other way.'" </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Klauth's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">Old Snarl is thought to have a generous number of magic
 items and known spells. Although he possesses more wands than his wings
 usually sport, changing them is a long and tiresome matter of linking 
and controlling spells that must be broken and then cast anew. From many
 accounts (given by adventurers, mages, and observers Volo judged not to
 be fabricating or exaggerating too badly), a tentative "roster" of the 
wing-wands employed by Klauth can be assembled. It's important to 
remember that the wing-wand list given here is quite likely to contain 
one or more errors.</p>
<p class="size2">On Klauth's left wing: </p>
<p class="size2">1. Outermost: <i>wand of ice storm</i><br> 2. Mid-mount: <i>wand of fireballs</i><br> 3. Innermost: <i>wand of polymorph other</i></p>
<p class="size2">On Klauth's right wing:</p>
<p class="size2">4. Outermost: <i>wand of hold person</i><br> 5. Mid-mount: <i>wand of lightning bolt<br></i>6. Innermost: <i>wand of dispel magic</i></p>
<p class="size2">The linkages Klauth has established (by still-secret spells developed by the old wyrm) enable him to employ the effects of <i>Alaunghaer's triptych</i> spells at will (in other words, activating multiple items without actually casting the <i>triptych</i> spell) activate wands #1, #2, and #4 in unison, or trigger wands #3, #5, and #6 together. </p>
<p class="size2">These <i>triptych</i> spells come from an original that
 Klauth stole from the lair of desert-dwelling dragon Iymrith (a magic 
possibly Netherese in origin, and presumably named for its creator), 
which follows hereafter. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Alaunghaer's Triptych<br></b>Transmutation<b><br> Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Targets:</b> Up to three magic items<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Special<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No (object) </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You activate up to three items you are wearing or 
carrying, which together count as a quickened spell (whether you 
activate one, two, or three items, it counts as a quickened spell for 
that round, preventing you from casting another quickened spell that 
round). These activations occur in any order you choose. Only one 
ability of any particular item can be activated by a particular use of 
this spell, and the ability must be a spell trigger- or command 
word-activated ability. The items must be items that you could otherwise
 activate (for example, you have to know the command word for the item, a
 character with no cleric levels could not use this spell to activate a <i>wand of cure light wounds</i>,
 and so on), and must be used properly (items that use magic item slots 
such as bracers and rings must be worn in the appropriate location, a 
wand must be held in hand, and so on). The items function normally (you 
choose the target or area, are subject to any limitation of the items, 
and so on) and do not suffer any penalties due to being activated 
quickly by the spell. You may aim the items at the same target or 
different targets. If more than one item generates a touch effect (such 
as <i>ghoul touch</i> and <i>shocking grasp</i>), only the 
last-activated item's touch effect functions, with the other or others 
having dispersed as if you had cast a spell while holding the charge on a
 touch spell (in short, activating multiple touch effects is a wasted 
use of the potential of this spell).</p>
<p class="size2">A triptych is not completely reliable. Each time the 
spell is cast, roll d% for each item; a result of 5% or less means the 
spell fails to activate the item. If the item were the first or second 
item activated by the triptych, you can attempt to activate it again 
with your remaining one or two activations from the spell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Theller's Argauneau<br></b>Necromancy<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 full round<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target:</b> One red dragon egg<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous or 1 hour/level (see text)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> See text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No (object) </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2">You drain the life energy from a red dragon egg and absorb it into yourself, which may be used for several purposes.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Healing:</i> Heal 5d6 points of damage as if a <i>cure </i>spell were cast on you. This has an instantaneous duration.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Ability Boost:</i> +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, lasting 1 hour per caster level.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Refresh Spell:</i> Regain one cast spell or used spell slot of any level you can cast, similar to a <i>pearl of power</i> except that bards, sorcerers, and similar casters can also benefit from it. This has an instantaneous duration.</p>
<p class="size2">A dragon egg is treated as an object, not a creature, 
and it does not get a saving throw against the spell unless it is in the
 possession of a creature (and therefore uses the normal saving throw 
rules for objects in the possession of a creature). If you are not a 
creature of the type "dragon," you must succeed at a Fortitude saving 
throw (DC 14) when you cast this spell; failure means you gain no 
benefit from the spell, take 3d6 points of damage, and are nauseated for
 1 round from the sudden influx of incompatible life energy.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Material Component:</i> A red dragon egg containing a living red dragon embryo, worth 2,000 gp.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Ed Greenwood</b> likes to go up to his cottage in 
the northern woods and relax with a good book atop a lofty rock that 
looks very much like the battlements of ruined Castle Grimstead in 
Shadowdale. He was quite startled one afternoon when Laeral, the Lady 
Mage of Waterdeep, stepped out of a nearby stone, winked at him, turned 
into a falcon, and flew away. Her appearance did help to explain the two
 piles of paperbacks he'd found when opening up the cottage one spring, 
labeled in flowing handwriting: "Utter Trash" and "Garbage, but I Liked 
Them." He reports that Elminster always picks "Utter Trash" books and 
ignores the other pile.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sean K Reynolds</b> spends a lot of his time on 
trains, working on his laptop or reading books, most of which are not 
"Utter Trash" but usually end up left behind on the train for some other
 person to enjoy.</p>
