<p align="left"><i>The dwarves dubbed the moody but essentially gentle dragon "Lady Gemcloak" for her glittering appearance . . .</i></p>
<p align="left">Until the night of the dragon duel, many citizens of 
Mirabar, longtime mining capital of the Sword Coast North, were unaware 
that they'd acquired a dragon protector. It was a still, damp evening in
 spring (of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR). The proprietors of the 
Watchful Axe alehouse were just about to harness their mules to the 
"round-and-rounds" that turned the blades of large fans that cooled 
patrons of their rooftop beer garden, when a golden glow appeared in the
 air overhead. It rapidly became a line of fire, "as if a scimitar was 
carving an arc out of the sky, and letting fire beyond spill through," 
as one watcher put it.</p>
<p align="left">The line became a rift -- an opening in the air -- and 
widened until it was as large across "as the length of the largest ships
 calling at Luskan to carry away the wares of Mirabar." Out of this 
fiery mouth flew a red dragon: an individual not seen before in the 
North, sages believe. None can agree on where it flew from or by what 
means it opened such a large <i>portal</i> in the sky (though the 
opinions most often muttered concerned the "crazed Cult of the Dragon 
mages" and "dabbling Red Wizards"), but all agree that it was large, 
sleek, and hungry.</p>
<p align="left">As the rift that had brought it closed like a purposeful
 eyelid, the red dragon clapped its wings, reared upright in triumph, 
and swooped down on the city like a playful child. Roaring and banking 
over the tiled rooftops to slap tiles and slates alike into ruin with 
its tail, it laid waste to a dozen homes before the frantic booming of a
 bell was heard from the Crags just southwest of the city (specifically,
 from the bald height known as Crostar's Vigil). Moments later, another 
dragon erupted into the air from somewhere behind that sentinel 
pinnacle, "glittering like a shower of gold" in the sunset, and plunged 
down upon the red wyrm, taking it completely by surprise and pouncing on
 it with such fury that the red dragon was driven onto the flag spires 
of no less than six residences and transfixed.</p>
<p align="left">The red freed itself with frantic thrashings, but not 
until after the newcomer, a crystal dragon, had bitten and torn 
viciously and enthusiastically at its underbelly. Dragon blood fell 
smoking into the streets as the red wyrm rose heavily into the air, 
flapping its wings in grim and obvious pain, and tried to fly away east 
up the Mirar.</p>
<p align="left">The crystal wyrm pounced again, demonstrating its 
agility to the watching citizenry by folding its wings and dropping like
 a stone to avoid a sudden gout of fire and a furious midair charge, 
then buzzed around the red dragon as a small bird harries a crow out of 
its territory, biting and raking until its foe turned away. The crystal 
dragon darted after it, striking again and again, until the red dragon, 
trailing ribbons of blood, fled at last out to sea.</p>
<p align="left">The crystal dragon followed, presumably to watch and 
prevent the red dragon's return, until its exhausted foe plunged into 
the waves and drowned. That red wyrm has been seen no more in Mirabar.</p>
<p align="left">Speculation in the city as to the identity and 
whereabouts of the crystal dragon was intense, and normally shunned 
prospectors and miners were gifted with copious drinkables and 
questioned about the mysterious wyrm. The story that emerged, once 
corroborations had been made and the more obvious fancies discarded, is 
thus: The crystal dragon Saryndalaghlothtor was now lairing in the Crags
 just southwest of Mirabar, so close as to overlook the city. Her recent
 arrival was connected to the cessation of goblin raids on outlying 
steads and caravan encampments in the vicinity.</p>
<p align="left">This unaccustomed peace befell shortly after overeager 
goblin mining caused an entire shoulder of mountainside to collapse into
 an underlying cavern (no doubt crushing scores of goblins in the 
process), and popular belief in Mirabar was that the "lurking goblins of
 the Crags" (long the bane of local dwarves) had well-nigh exterminated 
themselves. The truth was less tidy, but as dramatic: The collapse 
created a huge cave mouth in the side of one of the Crags, laying open a
 vast cavern that had hitherto been the center of the gem mine inhabited
 by the Kreeth goblin tribe.</p>
<p align="left">That cavern led into a string of large caves, from which
 many mining tunnels ran outwards into soft, damp rock pockmarked by 
many geodelike natural chambers lined with gem crystals. For years the 
goblins had tunneled steadily onwards and outwards, mining abundant gems
 of many sorts; rubies and beljurils were among their most numerous 
yields. The spawn of Kreeth tunneled slyly into the cellars of Mirabar, 
too, and made many night forays into the city, in disguise, whispering 
into the ears of the most desperate and impoverished humans. After many 
unsuccessful attempts to subvert citizens, the goblins reached secret 
agreements with some of the more impoverished Mirabarran gem-traders (in
 particular, the once-proud but now poor human families of Gulathkond 
and Jammaer), supplying them with gems brought directly into their 
cellars. In return, the humans paid the goblins handsomely in food, 
weapons, furs, leatherwork, and mining tools, covering their activities 
with false words of new alliances with prospectors working out of the 
Ten Towns.</p>
<p align="left">Freed from the need to undertake dangerous hunts for 
food on the surface and in the Underdark, the Kreeth goblins flourished,
 striking against any dwarves or human prospectors of Mirabar unwise 
enough to investigate the Crags too closely. Tales of their savagery and
 traps spread around the city, and few folk felt moved to investigate 
matters personally. "Breakneck" pits -- deep, narrow clefts equipped 
with sharpened stone spurs and covered with old tarpaulins concealed 
under handfuls of gravel, and held up with rotting saplings -- were 
commonplace Kreeth work, and they still stud the heights of the Crags 
within sight of the city, awaiting the unwary.</p>
<p align="left">The appearance of the cave changed all that. It occurred
 at a time of year when many young, displaced, or simply restless 
dragons wandered the vast wilderlands of the North, hoping that the 
legends of the mighty wyrms who claim them as domains were overblown or 
out-of-date, and that new territories could be carved out of the 
seemingly endless forested hills and crags.</p>
<p align="left">One such wanderer, an adult crystal she-dragon, found 
the raw, new scar in the rock almost at the gates of Mirabar and boldly 
dove down into the dazed remnants of the goblins, whom she slaughtered 
at will. They were too few and too terrified to strike at her from their
 small side tunnels as Saryndalaghlothtor roamed the larger caves, 
devouring exposed gem deposits and thinking she'd found some sort of 
crystal dragons' paradise. It had been a long and storm-wracked flight 
from the wastes of northern Raurin, but the ordeal, it seemed, had been 
worth it.</p>
<p align="left">The arrival of the dragon had gone unnoticed in Mirabar,
 but the rumbling collapse that preceded it by a day or so had not. Many
 Mirabarran dwarves thought it imperative that the tumult be 
investigated, but the known menace of the goblins made necessary the 
whelming of a warband; eager younglings were sternly prevented from 
"just hiking up for a look" by their elders.</p>
<p align="left">In the end, the armed dwarven force reached the cave at 
about the same time that the surviving goblins began to dart out of the 
smallest crawl-tunnels, where the dragon could not go, and strike at her
 in vicious counterattacks. A few dwarves swung their axes and charged 
the dragon, seeking glory, but their elders wrestled them down with the 
harsh command, "Goblins first!"</p>
<p align="left">The battle that followed was a long and bloody rout of 
dodging and chasing through the riven Kreeth mine, but in the end the 
last of the goblins were driven out or slain, and the dwarves warily 
approached the crystal dragon. One of the boldest, Haelbaran 
Stormshoulder, bade his fellows give him some time for parley, and then 
strode out and shared a dream with the wyrm: If she'd grant the 
Mirabarran dwarves permission to mine freely in her lair, defend it 
against intruders, and even to dwell in certain of its reaches, they'd 
feed her all the gems and metals she desired.</p>
<p align="left">The dragon considered Stormshoulder's words, then 
accepted the bargain with calm language. Not quite believing their good 
fortune, and knowing that many Mirabarrans would be rather less 
accepting of a dragon dwelling nigh their gates, the dwarves elected to 
keep word of the deal as quiet as possible. Many told relatives in the 
city, but it's likely that not a single human heard of it. Humans, in 
particular, regard Mithral Hall as a foe endangering their traditional 
prosperity; it's likely they'd be even more furious with a dwarven hold 
right next door. So in the city, the returning Mirabarran dwarves gave 
out the grim news that the Crags held no new mine, but only "goblin 
despoil and devastation" that would take years to cleanse, and was best 
avoided. Mirabar heard and believed, and the House of the Axe was 
founded.</p>
<p align="left">The dwarves dubbed the moody but essentially gentle 
dragon "Lady Gemcloak" for her glittering appearance, and later "The 
Axemother," as they came to see her as the "mother" under whose 
protection they could found a new city or tribe. She seemed happy to eat
 flawed and shattered gems and low-grade, leaden metal ores and rust 
scraps, and she and the dwarves soon came to trust each other. Word is 
spreading among dwarves across the North (and as far south as Waterdeep 
and Daggerford) of "a new hold" where dwarves of no famous clan or 
lineage can win a place among fellows in prosperity and ever- growing 
power. If the swelling ranks of dwarves dwelling all around her bothers 
Lady Gemcloak, she gives no sign of it.</p>
<p align="left">The only thing that does seem to irk her is her feeble 
magic. When unaided by magic items, she can cast only a handful of 
low-powered spells without aid, though she has quite a roster of such 
spells to choose among. Dwarves who've talked long with her (in 
particular, Tarltus Ulforge, and his sister Shaelee) say that one of the
 things that caused Saryndalaghlothtor to roam the north in the first 
place was the legend of <i>Argaut's Brain</i>.</p>
<p align="left">Briefly put, this recurring belief holds that anyone who
 finds and eats the brain of this long-dead (but magically preserved) 
archwizard gains his mastery of magic. Elminster confirms that this 
legend was born of wild apprentices' tales and given strength by an even
 more fanciful ballad; as far as he knows, the resting place of Argaut 
is lost, and he was no better preserved than most men who die suddenly. 
Moreover, the central belief, he insists, is false.</p>
<p align="left">Volo also believes the tale is wishful thinking. Some 
secret writings happened to briefly fall into his hands at a recent 
nobles' revel in Waterdeep: a report of experiments carried out by 
certain members of the Arcane Brotherhood. Their conclusions indicate 
that devouring dead mages' brains leads sometimes to illness or even 
insanity and sometimes transfers confused memories (scenes of places, 
people, or even events), but never coherent information or lore.</p>
<p align="left">Just how seriously Saryndalaghlothtor searched for 
Argaut's brain, or believed the tale, the dwarves know not . . . and 
Lady Gemcloak isn't telling.</p>
<p align="left">She is one of the crystal dragons who can communicate 
with any intelligent creature -- and, according to the dwarves, she is 
in no hurry to roam again or to acquire a mate. Saryndalaghlothtor 
considers a very small area (Mirabar and a modest stretch of the Crags) 
her domain, but she defends it fiercely. Other dragons, predators of all
 sorts -- including greedy humans -- and anyone the House of the Axe 
dwarves don't want around are considered unwanted intruders and dealt 
with accordingly. Lady Gemcloak is vicious in battle and enjoys maiming 
and spectacularly slaying foes. (Dismemberments and crushings are 
favorite tactics.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Saryndalaghlothtor's Lair</b></p>
<p align="left">As is the way of dwarves, the inhabitants of the House 
of the Axe have named the larger caverns, strategic passageways, and 
waymoots of the ever-expanding gem mine. Most of these names they keep 
secret from outsiders, but Volo learned that Saryndalaghlothtor can 
traverse at least six linked caverns. The westernmost (and innermost) 
the dwarves call "Home-hold," and it serves as their meeting place and 
staging/work area. Moving eastward, one comes to "Wyrmslumber" (where 
the Axemother likes to curl up and sleep on a bed of gems; it is the 
largest of all the caverns, but it has an eastern opening that is a 
tight squeeze for Saryndalaghlothtor and would halt the passage of any 
larger dragon), "Theller's Anvil" (though Theller and his anvil are now 
elsewhere, in smaller caves to the west), "Blackrun," "Eldock's Rest," 
and "The Maw," where the cave mouth created by overzealous goblin mining
 looks east out of the shoulder of Bryn Crag.</p>
<p align="left">The dwarves have left undisturbed the various goblin pit
 traps on the surface slopes around the lair. In addition, they added a 
few of their own, including "roll-boulder" deadfalls on high ledges all 
around the Maw (a succession of large rocks that can be rolled off a 
ledge to plunge down on intruders below) and "rockfalls" (stone slab 
ceilings on the major passages leading away from the Maw -- including 
the Slither, the main route used by Saryndalaghlothtor -- that can be 
winched aside to allow tons of loose rock above them to fall and block 
the way).</p>
<p align="left">An underground spring feeds pools in the 
southwesternmost reaches of the mine, and the dwarves are thought to 
cache many of the best gems to the northwest. Although the House dwarves
 have fewer elders and "old rank" families than established dwarven 
realms, a few "Dwarves of the Ring" hold absolute authority. Prominent 
among the more active and warlike are Corthold Flamehand and his sister 
Ieilhalla; strong among the more stay-at-home and artistic are the 
master forgers Theller and Auldrymbrei. They seldom bark commands unless
 the House is at war, but dwarves who disobey or ignore them are 
expelled from the House. The Ring has kept iron control over the release
 of gems, keeping prices high and reducing the chance that some greedy 
human force or other -- the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan, for example --
 might learn how rich the House is and decide to seize it for their own.
 For the same reason, the Ring absolutely forbids visitors to penetrate 
the House beyond the Maw or to take up residence in the mine.</p>
<p align="left">The dwarven accommodations are located in smaller 
outlying tunnels, mainly to the north (where anyone tunneling or 
skulking in from Mirabar is noticed), and they are always guarded by 
way-sentries equipped with alarm gongs and warhorns. Many sentry posts 
are equipped with small rockfall devices that the sentries can trigger 
to bar the way they guard and prevent invasions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Saryndalaghlothtor's Domain </b></p>
<p align="left">The Maw opens to the surface on the eastern face of Bryn
 Crag, which stands just west of the Long Road, shielded from the view 
of travelers by Old Man Crag (so named for its resemblance to the 
weathered face of a giant buried in the earth up to his neck, staring 
endlessly east across the road at Barlaerl's Crag). From this point, 
Saryndalaghlothtor roams the water-meadows of the River Mirar north over
 the city as far as the eye can see (about six miles), as well as a 
sweep of the Crags from Tannath's Tor in the southwest to Ammirar's 
Blade to the northeast (a length of some nine miles and forty or so 
pinnacles and peaks ).</p>
<p align="left">The Axemother cares little about human or dwarven 
activity in her domain that doesn't actually involve invading her lair 
with raised weapons and threatening words, but she reacts to any dragon 
or goblin incursion by bursting from her lair in all-out attack. She 
loves to pounce, but she isn't as reckless as she seems, and she can 
seldom be duped into plunging into a waiting trap or a situation where 
she can be cornered by a prepared and alert foe.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Doings of Saryndalaghlothtor</b></p>
<p align="left">Lady Gemcloak, like all of her kind, enjoys dining on 
metallic ores and gems of all sorts, but she indulges in occasional 
"blood meals" of goblins, wyverns, or other creatures who challenge her.
 She hunts the skies over Mirabar and down the Mirar valley and does not
 hesitate to pursue foes out to sea or over the Evermoors. The Mirar is 
her favorite watering-hole, though she often drinks from meltwater pools
 high in the Crags or the many small lakes that lie in the bogs to the 
north of the Mirar.</p>
<p align="left">Saryndalaghlothtor spends a typical day dozing on her 
bed of gems chatting with dwarves (who bring her news of doings in 
Mirabar and the wider Sword Coast North, and who focus on traders 
passing through her domain in particular). She'll take to the air for a 
short "wingstretch and sniff the wind" flight (often at twilight or in 
concealing mists or rain) once every day or two if she can, and she 
takes an active interest in the development of the mine and her dwarven 
"children."</p>

<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Once every 1d4 rounds, 
Saryndalaghlothtor can breathe a 50-foot cone of brilliant light. Each 
creature in the area takes 12d6 points of damage and is blinded for 1d4 
rounds. A successful DC 25 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the
 blinding effect.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Crush (Ex): </b>When flying or jumping, 
Saryndalaghlothtor can land on Small or smaller opponents as a standard 
action, using her whole body to crush them. A crush attack affects as 
many creatures as can fit in the 15-ft.-by-15-ft. area under her body. 
Each creature in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 25)
 or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next 
round unless Saryndalaghlothtor moves off of it. If she chooses to 
maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents 
take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex): </b>When Saryndalaghlothtor 
attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature within a 360-foot 
radius that has 19 or fewer HD must attempt a DC 23 Will save. On a 
failure, it becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds if it has 4 or fewer HD or 
shaken for 4d6 rounds if it has 5 or more HD. Success renders the 
creature immune to Saryndalaghlothtor's frightful presence for 24 hours.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Psionics</i> (Sp):</b> 3/day -- <i>charm person </i>(DC
 1d20 + 4). Manifester level 5th. Saryndalaghlothtor manifests powers 
and gains additional attack and defense modes as if she were a psion 
with Telepathy as her primary discipline.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> Saryndalaghlothtor can pinpoint 
creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents she can't actually see
 still have total concealment against her.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Keen Senses (Ex): </b>Saryndalaghlothtor sees four 
times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in

<p align="left"><b>Saryndalaghlothtor's Magic</b></p>
<p align="left">Among Lady Gemcloak's store of written spells are many 
beyond her mastery and a huge array of 1st-level spells. Most are old 
spells that are rarely found these days. She commands only a modest 
hoard but is known to possess a rare and powerful item, described 
hereafter, which she keeps well hidden, knowing she can't herself use 
its full effects but that they could be used against her to devastating 
effect.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Helm of Supreme Wizardry:</b> This ornate, fluted 
"sallet"-style helm is of steel plated with a silver alloy and alters to
 fit the head of any creature donning it.</p>
<p align="left"><i>A helm of supreme wizardry </i>allows any being 
already able to cast wizard spells who wears it to temporarily cast two 
additional spells of spell levels 6-9 (8 spells per day total). These 
are treated as bonus spell slots (as if from a very high Intelligence) 
and therefore can be used only by those already capable of casting 
spells of those levels (though such a caster can still use the slots to 
prepare lower-level or metamagicked spells). Casting a spell from one of
 these bonus slots deals 1d6+1 points of damage to the wearer (which can
 be healed normally or through magic); the caster takes the damage the 
instant she completes the spell. If the helm is removed, any bonus 
spells prepared with it are immediately lost.</p>
<p align="left">The helm has several drawbacks. First, if all of the 
extra spells prepared with the helm are not cast within 12 hours of 
their preparation, it causes the wearer to lose all prepared wizard 
spells at the end of that period (affecting the bonus spells from the 
helm and any other wizard spells the wearer had prepared normally). The 
spell slots for those lost spells are considered cast (the wearer must 
rest again to use the spell slots). Note that only the bonus spell slots
 used by the wearer need to be expended to prevent this from happening. 
For example, a 12th-level wizard with the helm has access only to spell 
slots of 6th-level and lower. She can use only the two bonus 6th-level 
spell slots from the helm, and if she casts both of those within 12 
hours of preparing them then this drawback is not triggered. (In other 
words, she is not penalized for not being able to use the 7th- and 
higher-level bonus spell slots granted by the helm.)</p>
<p align="left">The second drawback is if the helm is ever used (not 
merely worn, but actually used to prepare spells in its bonus slots) by 
the same wearer twice in a tenday, it deals 1 point of permanent 
Intelligence drain upon the wearer, and the attempt to use the extra 
slots fails.</p>
<p align="left">The third drawback is if the helm is ever used twice in 
the same 30-day period by the same wearer to prepare spells of the same 
school, the preparation succeeds but the wearer immediately suffers 1 
point of permanent Intelligence drain and permanently loses 1 hit point.
 Despite this great price, as long as it is worn, the helm allows the 
wearer to cast these bonus spells, even if the Intelligence loss means 
the wearer could not normally cast spells of that level any more.</p>
<p align="left">For example, if the wearer uses the helm to prepare <i>antimagic field</i> and <i>chain lightning</i>, then twenty-eight days later uses the helm to prepare <i>greater dispel magic</i> (the same school as <i>antimagic field</i>), the wearer would incur those losses. If she persisted in her folly and used the helm to prepare <i>Bigby's forceful hand</i> (the same school as <i>chain lightning</i>)
 she would suffer the losses again. If her Intelligence was originally 
16, she'd be reduced to Intelligence 14, normally not enough to cast <i>greater dispel magic</i> or <i>Bigby's forceful hand</i>, but the power of the helm allows her to still cast those spells (but not any other spells of that level prepared normally).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Saryndalaghlothtor's Fate</b></p>
<p align="left">Lady Gemcloak is likely to receive severe 
battle-testings at the hands of greedy adventurers (sponsored by 
Mirabarran mining families or the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan, if by no
 one else), and might also be a magnet for dwarves desiring to join a 
"new" hold (free of old feuds and bitter clan memories) and goblins 
desiring revenge . . . and where goblins rush in, orcs usually follow.</p>
<p align="left">Saryndalaghlothtor might swiftly perish if she rejects 
offers of alliances and aid from the Dragon Queen or other friendly 
wyrms (for instance, the reclusive Thalagyrt -- whom we'll look at next 
month -- possesses a spell, <i>gemfire</i>, that the Axemother would 
find very useful), dwarven adventuring bands, and the like -- for news 
of the whereabouts and gem-rich properties of her lair is certain to 
reach unfriendly draconic ears eventually. . . .</p>
