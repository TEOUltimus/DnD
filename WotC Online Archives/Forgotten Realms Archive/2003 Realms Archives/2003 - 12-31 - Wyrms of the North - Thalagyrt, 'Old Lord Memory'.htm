<p align="left"><i>This prissy and pedantic mist dragon might not like being disturbed, but he knows where the loot is buried.</i></p>
<p align="left">This very old mist dragon lairs in a damp, dripping 
network of caverns on the shore of the Sea of Swords, north of Port 
Ilast. He keeps to himself as much as possible, and many folk who dwell 
nearby don't even know he exists. His hobby is collecting and 
remembering lore valued by the intelligent races that dwell in the 
North, such as singular items of treasure and magic items. One must 
trade information to obtain the desired knowledge from him, and both 
generous offers of interesting lore and a persistent but pleasant manner
 are needed to overcome his distaste for being disturbed.</p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt long ago earned the nickname "Old Lord Memory"
 both for his prissy, pedantic character and his utter fearlessness. No 
threat is known to have moved him, and attacks -- even by obviously 
formidable foes such as beholders and other dragons -- always evoke 
gusty sighs of boredom and grumblings at being disturbed. No one, save 
perhaps Thalagyrt himself (and he isn't telling), remembers who coined 
this term, which is usually uttered by human sages, notably those of 
Waterdeep. These learned folk often send adventurers with unusual lore 
queries to him, with a mixture of affection and exasperation, as a 
"court of last resort."</p>
<p align="left">The mist dragon's character can best be described as 
doleful and grumpy, but those who often have dealings with him say that 
he can become a loyal friend to beings of all races and may well be a 
romantic at heart. His rare, unexpected, and sudden rescues of favorite 
friends can be attributed only to genuine caring and energetic magical 
spying from afar. Many of these are adventurers, which suggests that the
 dragon derives entertainment from his farscryings and chooses as 
favorites those who do the most interesting and exciting things. </p>
<p align="left">The keys to Thalagyrt's character could be said to be 
his undying interest in other intelligent creatures and pleasure in 
witnessing and recording their deeds. He views all creatures with 
compassion and humor and probably understands "human nature" better than
 most humans. He can outwit foes who try to dupe him (his intellect is 
prodigious), but he finds riddles and games intended to impress others 
tiresome, and he would never himself try to deceive anyone maliciously.</p>
<p align="left">Old Lord Memory is a foe of adventurers, orcs, and other
 marauders who attempt to slay, despoil, and steal. He also despises 
aggressive dragons; he thinks dragonkind fell from mastery of Faerûn 
because of the arrogant, ruthless, and self-interested behavior of wyrms
 in the past. "They're all deservedly dead now," he observes with gloomy
 satisfaction, "not that their passings improved anything."</p>
<p align="left"><b>Thalagyrt's Lair</b></p>
<p align="left">The nameless caverns where Old Lord Memory dwells possess a variant <i>wardmist</i>
 laid down by a previous, unknown owner. This feature is the dragon's 
reason for choosing these cold, wet, coastal caverns as his home; he can
 control the wards to hide himself behind mists almost as solid as 
stone, change illumination and temperature in areas it encloaks, and so 
on. He's still learning some of its powers, so he keeps its secrets to 
himself as much as possible, but visitors to Thalagyrt's lair have 
witnessed the effects equivalent to <i>cloudkill</i>, <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>shadow conjuration</i>, <i>solid fog</i>, <i>telekinesis</i>
 (of both "visiting" items and of a large spike-studded rectangle of 
metal bars that the mist dragon drops from above on especially energetic
 intruders), <i>wall of fog</i>, and <i>wall of force</i>. The <i>wardmist</i>
 "scrambles" all mind-influencing magic, psionics, and spells from the 
school of enchantment, negating their effects within the caverns -- and 
thus protecting Thalagyrt from them. It also "fogs" <i>arcane eye</i>,<i> scrying</i>,
 and other magical farscrying attempts to spy into the lair from 
outside, though this property -- for unknown reasons -- is unreliable 
and intermittent. How this <i>wardmist</i> acquired so many powers is a mystery . . . and Old Lord Memory would like it to remain so.</p>
<p align="left">Most of the lair consists of long, curving tunnels that 
Thalagyrt can barely fit down without scraping the walls, but its 
landward reaches feature a large circle of natural caverns that contain 
food, monetary treasure, books, stone markers salvaged from lands lost 
to the sea, and even lore-tablets from elder realms. Several caves 
around the circle are connected to a central sleeping-cavern reportedly 
large enough for several dragons to move around in simultaneously. It 
holds a glowing sleeping mound of soft, thick mosses studded with 
phosphorescent mushrooms.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Thalagyrt's Domain</b></p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt ignores the draconic concept of domains and 
avoids fighting any other wyrms he meets, whenever possible. "Just leave
 me alone" might well be his watchphrase. This means he is timid, but 
certainly not craven. If forced to fight, he can call, from afar by 
magic, swift and powerful aid from the Chosen, the Heralds, Malchor 
Harpell, and others who value the lore he preserves.</p>
<p align="left">A foolish upper prelate of Candlekeep, now dead, once 
offered a large reward for the capture and delivery of Thalagyrt, alive,
 into the keeping of the "Learned by the Sea." Many adventuring bands 
tried to earn the reward and were routed either by Thalagyrt or his 
powerful allies, until Dove Falconhand grew weary of these demands on 
her time and asked her sister the Simbul to pay a visit to Candlekeep to
 personally persuade Most Learned Archprelate Rheldryn Uoulimpurt to 
rescind his reward offer publicly and add the firm advice that calling 
on the mist dragon Thalagyrt with weapons and forceful intent was not 
only foolish but apt to be fatal. It's said that "Rheldryn was tearfully
 eager to comply."</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Deeds of Thalagyrt</b></p>
<p align="left">The favorite foods of Old Lord Memory are buttered fried
 snails and the green, slimy, soft Chultan jungle tree slugs that reach 8
 feet or more in length, but he considers any slug or turtle to be a 
delicacy, even dragon turtles. Mist and shorewash algae are his staple 
dietary items, but they don't thrill him -- as, indeed, very little 
does. Visitors have brought him sweets and liqueurs, and they report 
that he loves these but hates being "bribed with food." Attempts to do 
so could easily backfire on would-be lore-seekers seeking to ply the 
dragon with edibles.</p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt is said to have the constitution of a 
mountain: He can eat anything, even deadly poisons or mist-dragon flesh,
 without apparent revulsion or ill effects. It's likely that past 
exposures to several poisons have engendered in him a strong inner 
resistance, if not immunity. Thalagyrt eats prodigiously, but not often 
(perhaps twice a month), though he glides almost daily through the spray
 of waves crashing on the shore, deriving nutrients from them. He exists
 in a state of perpetual dampness and is not bothered by this in the 
least. He can and does drink seawater without ill effects, but he 
prefers to "drink" the mists.</p>
<p align="left">Old Lord Memory spends most days watching and listening 
to events all over Faerûn -- in particular, human and elven societies 
within the Sword Coast North. He never seems to forget anything, though 
his recall can be slow, and the lore he imparts to others is seldom 
extensive. He believes that, for most folk, "less in their heads is 
better." </p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt can employ spells of his own devising to 
"project" (as three-dimensional images) scenes that live in his memory 
-- and his mind holds thousands upon thousands of memories. Some are 
surprisingly important or private moments to humans or allied races. 
(Thalagyrt has made a career of collecting mind images from dying folk 
and others who desire to share and preserve recollections of events.)</p>
<p align="left">A visitor who persuades (usually by payment of large 
amounts of gold coins) Old Lord Memory to yield up a choice memory can, 
for example, see and hear the confrontation in the throne room in Suzail
 where the risen Azoun confronted the traitors who sought to murder him;
 an elven conversation in the green fastnesses of Evermeet; or a tender,
 murmuring love-meeting between the great mages Elminster and the 
Simbul, Witch-Queen of Aglarond. These are but a few examples of 
literally thousands of scenes, some of them crucial to an understanding 
of now-crumbling treaties and long-dead heroes, rulers, and villains. </p>
<p align="left">What Thalagyrt does with those payments is hire agents 
to learn and report tiny, apparently insignificant things to fill in 
gaps in his knowledge. Wherever possible, he prefers to gain such lore 
from primary sources -- that is, folk who were there or directly 
involved, not proxies or written records. Occasionally, Thalagyrt hires 
adventurers to rid himself of persistent attackers or bribe these 
attackers to go away and leave him to think and observe. He views 
bullies and fools with contempt, for he can't be blackmailed or 
successfully threatened. None know his earlier life; he's simply "always
 been there" in his dripping coastal caverns. He has never, to anyone's 
recollection, mated or consorted closely with other dragons.</p>
<p align="left">Old Lord Memory has a shrewd grasp of human character, 
has studied human conspiracies, and has learned how to hire help to best
 winkle out human secrets. He knows such things as the identities of the
 current Lords of Waterdeep, which noble families of that city have had 
secret meetings with the Brotherhood of the Arcane or the Cult of the 
Dragon, and the fate of Gondegal the Lost King. His information is more 
accurate the older it is, and (always) runs out entirely about a year 
ago. Whether he reveals these or other things to casual or persistent 
visitors is another matter; Thalagyrt has his own code and makes his own
 judgments of those who seek him out. He may volunteer much, sell what 
is desired dearly, or give only cryptic hints or warnings -- or act 
befuddled with age and yield nothing useful no matter what coercion is 
applied. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapons (Su): </b>Once every 1d4 rounds, 
Thalagyrt can breathe a 50-foot cone of scalding steam or a 100-foot 
line of caustic slime. Each creature in the area of the scalding steam 
takes 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 29 half). Each creature in 
the area of the caustic slime must make a DC 29 Fortitude save or be 
sickened for 1d6+9 rounds.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Crush (Ex): </b>Whenever Thalagyrt flies or jumps, he
 can land on opponents as a standard action, using his whole body to 
crush them. His crush attack affects Small or smaller opponents within a
 15-foot-by-15-foot area. Each potentially affected creature must 
succeed on a DC 25 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking 2d8+15
 points of bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon 
moves off. If Thalagyrt chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a 
normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each 
round if they don't escape. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex): </b>Whenever Thalagyrt 
attacks, charges, or flies overhead, each creature in a 270-foot radius 
that has 26 or fewer HD must make a DC 27 Will save. Failure indicates 
that the creature is panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it has 4 or fewer HD) 
or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or more HD).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>3/day -- <i>fog cloud, gust of wind</i> (DC 16), <i>sleet storm, wind wall; </i>1/day -- <i>solid fog.</i> Caster level 13th.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spells:</b> Thalagyrt casts spells as a 13th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b> Thalagyrt can pinpoint creatures
 within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents he can't actually see still 
have total concealment against him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Keen Senses (Ex): </b>Thalagyrt can see four times as
 well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal 
light. He also has darkvision to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mist Form (Su):</b> At will as a standard action, 
Thalagyrt can assume a misty form. This power works just like a gaseous 
form spell (caster level 13th) except as follows: Thalagyrt loses his 
+26 natural armor bonus, but gains a +18 deflection bonus to AC. While 
in mist form, he is indistinguishable from mist or fog and gains total 
concealment when in any kind of natural or magical fog or mist. His 
damage reduction increases to 25/magic. He can fly at a speed of 75 feet
 with perfect maneuverability. He cannot use his natural weaponry or

<p align="left"><b>Thalagyrt's Magic</b></p>
<p align="left">Old Lord Memory has access to almost all known human 
sorcerer/wizard spells of 1st-through 7th-level (through scrolls, 
spellbooks, and other sources) and a fair smattering of 8th- and 
9th-level magic. Although spells of 7th-level and above are beyond his 
personal mastery, he possesses many memories (gained, of course, from 
other beings, by use of a unique spell that transfers not only memories,
 but spell knowledge) of the specifics of casting them, and of their 
effects. Of the spells the dragon can use, three appear hereafter. One 
of Thalagyrt's 1st-level favorites is of particular interest. A rare 
magic believed to have descended from a Netherese apprentice's spell 
(another copy lies in a well-guarded and hidden tome in Candlekeep), the
 <i>gemfire</i> spell would prove very useful to many dragons, 
Saryndalaghlothtor (described in last month's issue) in particular. 
Thalagyrt uses his <i>gemfire</i> spell on a false gemstone (a rock 
crystal as large as a man's head, facet-cut in the same manner as many 
valuable stones) that rests on a flimsy, mostly submerged stick spanning
 a pool of flammable oil which, when ignited, triggers an explosion that
 sprays in all directions; creatures within 15 feet are likely to take 
ld6 points of damage from flaming oil splashes (Reflex DC 15 negates).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gemfire<br></b>Transmutation [Fire]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 1<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Targets: </b>All nonmagic gems or crystals of Tiny size or smaller within a 15 ft. radius burst, or a single crystalline creature<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates (object) and Reflex half (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (object)</p>
<p align="left">This spell causes all nonmagic gems or rock crystals 
(such as quartz) within its range to explode, destroying them. The 
exploding gems deal damage to all creatures nearby. Half this damage is 
piercing and half is fire. The size of the gem determines the amount of 
damage and the size of the blast, according to the following table.</p>
<table border="0" width="300" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><b>Size </b></td>
<td><b>Damage </b></td>
<td><b>Explosion Radius</b></td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E9E9E9"><td>Fine</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0 (same square only)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Diminutive</td>
<td>1d2</td>
<td>5 ft.</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E9E9E9"><td>Tiny</td>
<td>1d4</td>
<td>10 ft.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Creatures in the explosion area can attempt a Reflex 
save to reduce the explosion damage by half. Multiple gems in close 
proximity are treated as a single larger gem for the purpose of the 
effects of this spell. For example, a diamond ring with ten Fine stones 
is treated as a single Diminutive gem rather than ten Fine gems, and a 
Diminutive bag filled with Fine gems is treated as a single Diminutive 
gem. An item with a gem inset (such as a jeweled ring) is not destroyed 
by the exploding gem unless the damage from the explosion would destroy 
it. A collection of Tiny gems explodes in 10-foot burst for 1d6 points 
of damage.</p>
<p align="left">The spell has no effect on noncrystal stones or magic 
items. If cast on a creature made of crystal (such as a gemstone golem 
from <i>Monsters of Faerûn</i>) it takes 1d4 points of damage per caster
 level (maximum 5d4) and deals damage to nearby creatures as if it were a
 Tiny gem. The target creature gets a Fortitude saving throw to negate 
all effects of the spell. </p>
<p align="left">A 4th-level variant of this spell, <i>Gharradin's slow gemfire</i>,
 causes gems to explode 1 or more rounds after the spell is cast, 
similar to using the Delay Spell feat (this variant deals a maximum of 
15d4 points of damage to a crystalline creature).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mistclaw<br></b>Conjuration (Creation)<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, F<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range: </b>Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> Small draconic claw made of mist<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">You create a disembodied dragon claw made out of shadowy
 translucent mist. It moves within range as you direct it (a free 
action). The claw can pass through any opening that would allow fog or 
mist to pass through it. It can be used in one of two ways, and you can 
change the way that you use the claw each round.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Directed Attack: </i>As a standard action you can direct the claw to attack a creature in range.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Supplemental Attack:</i> As a free action you can 
direct the claw to assist you in fighting a creature you are attacking 
in melee. The claw does not interfere with your attacks, nor you its 
(for example, neither you nor the claw suffer any penalties for fighting
 with two weapons).</p>
<p align="left">The claw always uses your melee attack bonus and deals 
1d4+4 points of slashing damage. It is treated as a magic weapon for the
 purpose of bypassing damage reduction. It does not get iterative 
attacks. It always attacks from your direction and cannot flank or gain 
the benefits from flanking with another creature. The claw does not 
convey spells (unlike <i>spectral hand</i>). If not directed to attack 
on a particular round, the claw returns to you and hovers. If an 
attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check 
against that spell resistance the first time the <i>mistclaw</i> strikes it. If the creature resists the spell, the claw is dispelled, otherwise it has its normal full effect on the creature.</p>
<p align="left">The claw can be attacked. It is treated as a Small 
creature (+1 size bonus to AC) with a natural armor bonus equal to your 
Intelligence (if a wizard spell) or Charisma (if a sorcerer spell) 
bonus. It has 10 hit points +1/caster level. Destroying the mistclaw 
does not harm you. It is not incorporeal and does not have an 
incorporeal miss chance, and it does not ignore the miss chance of 
incorporeal targets (though it can harm incorporeal creatures because it
 is treated as a magic weapon).</p>
<p align="left">The wizards Cardatha of Silverymoon and Baerdrunsun of Alaghon are known to have independently demonstrated versions of the <i>mistclaw</i> spell at recent magefairs. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Focus:</i> Mist, fog, or steam, whether present 
naturally in the environment, created by magic, or trapped in a closed 
container possessed by the caster. Nondraconic casters must also have a 
dragon scale or talon as a focus.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Muritho's Randomscatter<br></b>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target:</b> Creature touched<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</p>
<p align="left">You create a scintillating chaotic aura of random 
magical arcs, flashes, and other minor effects. This display looks very 
impressive but is entirely defensive in nature; creatures touching the 
target suffer no ill effects.</p>
<p align="left">This spell has three effects that operate 
simultaneously. First, the target gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving 
throws against magical effects. Second, it provides acid, cold, 
electricity, fire, and sonic resistance 5. Third, each time the 
recipient is subjected to force damage from an effect of 1st level or 
lower (such as <i>magic missile</i>), that damage is reduced by 5 points before being applied to the creature's hit points.</p>
<p align="left">Due to a quirk of the spell's formula, it ends instantly
 if cast on a creature already protected by a spell or effect that 
creates a visible aura (such as <i>entropic shield</i>). The aura is fragile, and any use of magic by the target causes the <i>randomscatter</i> to end instantly.</p>
<p align="left">Muritho is a long-dead human mage of forgotten origin. 
Old Lord Memory uses this spell without modification -- and therefore it
 is also usable without modification by humans who examine Thalagyrt's 
spell scrolls. There is also a 5th-level spell variant, <i>Muritho's spell-shield</i>, that negates all <i>magic missile</i>
 damage, gives energy resistance 10, lasts for 1 minute/level, and 
requires as its material component a flame ignited by any means from 
combustibles (typically wood, bone, or charcoal) that bear some sort of 
magic.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Thalagyrt's Fate</b></p>
<p align="left">Word of Old Lord Memory's existence and location is 
slowly spreading in Waterdeep. Nobles discuss him with fair accuracy at 
revels, while commoners hear rumors of "a dragon in a seashore cave who 
sees all things and remembers everything . . . and so can reveal just 
who murdered so-and-so, or tell what became of vanished Uncle Auldo." 
Waterdhavian noble houses have begun sending messengers (heavily laden 
with gold) to Thalagyrt's nameless lair. Almost all of them seek answers
 to family queries, such as "What became of the lost heir to the house, 
who wandered off some eighty years back? Did he have offspring -- and if
 so, who and where are they?" or "Who really stabbed Lord Hrimm at the 
revel? An agent of his rival Lord Alandalar, or someone else -- and if 
the latter, why?" or "Who stole Lady Jamarra's tiara, and where is it 
now?" The dragon finds them entertaining diversions and helps as best he
 can in return for payment. Although he cares little who learns such 
secrets, Thalagyrt finds the second or third identical query tiresome, 
and if he's already told the heirs of Lord Palschane the Lord's fate, 
he's quite likely to give less accurate or extensive answers to sages, 
agents of rival houses, or creditors. (Readers who find the names in 
these examples unfamiliar are advised that they are first names; 
surnames have been omitted on Elminster's advice to protect the privacy 
of the noble families involved. As the Old Mage commented, "This 
precaution cuts down on assassination attempts against periodical 
columnists and editors who are too clever for their own good, helping 
the hired daggers to meet the demands of their already-crowded schedules
 . . . a thoughtful consideration, ye see, for all concerned.") </p>
<p align="left">Thalagyrt is less welcoming to the adventurers and 
wizards who follow. He's uneasy about spreading magical information, and
 he has already rebuffed several overly demanding mages and Cult of the 
Dragon deputations. His worst disputes, however, have involved members 
of the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan, and someday they might well bring 
about the mist dragon's doom by slaying or imprisoning him. </p>
<p align="left">Thus far, Old Lord Memory has sent two ambitious Arcane 
underlings to their deaths by providing the whereabouts of archmage's 
tombs they desired to plunder -- by neglecting to mention traps and 
lingering spells he knew to wait therein. A more formidable Brotherhood 
mage died in Thalagyrt's lair when he defied the dragon and opened a 
trapped chest. It released a "ravening force that incinerated him" (as 
farscrying Arcane wizards described it). This was actually a <i>wand of fireball</i> triggered by a watchghost (an undead being described in <i>The Ruins of Undermountain</i> boxed set) hiding in the chest.</p>
<p align="left">In life, the watchghost was Norlatha Saundshauloe (LN 
human female Wiz7). A woman of surpassing ugliness and tall, gaunt 
build, Norlatha was usually thought to be a man by most who met her. She
 dwelt in Baldur's Gate, where she made a living casting spells for 
hire: leakproofings, building constructions, rust and mold removals, and
 the like, not adventuring magics. She's now a firm friend of Thalagyrt 
and serves as his "butler" -- the hands that (unseen by most visitors) 
set traps, move treasure, and otherwise see to the cleanliness and 
maintenance of his lair. She remains insubstantial and as invisible as 
possible most of the time, existing only as a soft, sarcastic voice with
 whom Old Lord Memory bandies words. Most Brotherhood spies think the 
dragon is less than sane and talks to himself often, but a few have 
observed "the gloomy servant-man" and wondered as to her origins, 
nature, and identity.</p>
