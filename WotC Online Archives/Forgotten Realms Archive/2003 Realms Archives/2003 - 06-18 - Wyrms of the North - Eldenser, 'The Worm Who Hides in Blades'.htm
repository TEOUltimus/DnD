<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px;"><i><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2006-18%20-%20Wyrms%20of%20the%20North%20-%20Eldenser,%20%27The%20Worm%20Who%20Hides%20in%20Blades%27_files/dragon_237_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="236" width="186"></span></i></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 time around, Volo has uncovered one of the most unusual and interesting
 dragons of the North: Eldenser, the Worm Who Hides in Blades. Whispered
 of in obscure legends of the North for some six centuries (and 
described as frail with age even in his earliest mention), Eldenser is 
an amethyst great wyrm of decrepit, wearywise appearance. Long ago he 
mastered magic that allows him to leave his withered, wasted body in a 
secure hideaway (reportedly a crypt in Waterdeep's City of the Dead) and
 transport his sentience into the blade of any tempered, edged metal 
weapon.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 this way, Eldenser has cheated death down the ages, preserving his 
slowly-crumbling form as much as possible by leaving it unused and 
walled away from air and elements, as he passes from blade to blade, 
able to see, hear, and speak freely out of the metal -- and all metals 
in direct contact with a blade he currently inhabits. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Authorities
 unanimously refer to this dragon as a male, and the few that make 
mention of his true draconic body say that his wings are little more 
than tatters hanging between the structural spines, and that his scales 
are almost white in places, paling with age in the same way that the 
ancient black dragon of Cormyr became "the Purple Dragon." He is said to
 have tufted eyebrows and an extensive "beard" of spines on his chin, 
both white in hue, and to have very wise large eyes whose customary 
appearance is "twinkling with inner amusement." </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 younger days, Eldenser was said to be a solitary wanderer among 
dragons, who flitted about Faerûn (the Sword Coast North wilderlands in 
particular) without apparent rhyme or reason, following his own whims. 
It's now clear that he was enjoying his first love: the observation of 
all living things, and learning how they appear and "work" in all stages
 of life. The deep knowledge of this sort that he's acquired down the 
ages makes him both less proud and more formidable than most dragons -- 
he knows the causes and effects of deeds and events more than most 
living beings of Toril. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 also clear from the historical record that Eldenser tends to avoid 
other dragons -- but to reveal himself as a wily, enthusiastic, and 
savage fighter when attacked. Three women of the household of the 
long-ago nomad lord Tharnor of the North saw Lorragauth, a black dragon 
of some reputation, swoop down to attack Eldenser when the Lurker was 
intruding into Lorragauth's territory. As Lorragauth spread his wings to
 slow and aim himself for a devastating pounce, Eldenser calmly snapped 
his wings once, rolling to rise sharply under Lorragauth's right wing --
 and the Lurker burst up through it, tearing one of his foe's wings 
almost right off the wyrm's body, sending the luckless Lorragauth 
"cartwheeling across the rocks and sky, to a broken and splintered death
 against a mountainside some way off to the south." </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eldenser
 is also said to have snatched up a fishing boat while in full flight 
from a gigantic red dragon and looped in the air to use the vessel as a 
crude spear, piercing his foe's eye and slaying him before the racing 
red wyrm could slow down or duck aside. Most of Eldenser's exploits 
preserved in Realmslore, however, concern his deeds while lurking in 
various swords -- such as the time he caused the death of the 
notoriously cruel and destructive mage Arnaglym of Arrabar by 
unexpectedly reflecting a <i>fireball</i> spell that Arnaglym had cast 
at Eldenser's wielder, hurling it back at the mage, who stood in a hall 
with a massive hammerbeam ceiling hung with huge old tinder-dry 
tapestries -- which became a smothering inferno from which even the fell
 Arnaglym could not escape. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There
 are a score of similar surprising tales of astonishing powers bursting 
from blades that Eldenser is known to be the cause of, and many more 
that he isn't connected to by present-day bards and sages -- but for 
which he may in truth be responsible. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 important to remember that Eldenser fights only when battle can't be 
avoided readily; he prefers to observe and remain undetected or at least
 ignored. He likes just to watch silently, and this habit has given him a
 rich range of experiences and knowledge, from how to cook certain 
complicated recipes to the configurations of sewers and back alleys in 
many cities, to where certain treasures lie hidden. It has been said 
(and repeated by some elder Harpers) that "Eldenser sees much, and never
 forgets anything from an expression on one face glimpsed in a crowd to 
the position of gaming pieces on a board seen through a doorway while 
passing in haste." The Lurker will never do anything as crass as sell 
such information, but he'll often trade a service for some of it, to get
 adventurers or others to do something he doesn't want to take a hand in
 directly -- but wants to watch. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Elminster
 has corrected many of the suppositions about Eldenser's powers that 
follow, but he stresses that adventurers shouldn't trust in what is said
 here; the Lurker's true abilities may be more potent. All of what 
immediately follows refers to the dragon's powers while he is within a 
metal object, which is almost always a sword of fine make. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eldenser
 knows Common and several human and elven tongues. Eldenser dislikes the
 "feel" of metal items that have alignments not at least partially 
neutral, and he won't remain in them for more than a minimally necessary
 time to bring about a likely transfer to a more suitable home (in other
 words, until he perceives other metal items near; he never likes to go 
"drifting blind"). He won't manifest any of his powers or cast any 
spells when in such a situation except those that are likely to bring 
about an immediate possibility of transfer. (He might spit out lightning
 to attract an adventurer's attention, for example, to allow him to move
 into that adventurer's weapon.) </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eldenser
 is sometimes called "the Lurker" in the lore of the North because he 
reveals himself only if he chooses, often spending much time silently 
observing those who wield him (or rather, the blade he currently 
inhabits) before speaking to them or exhibiting his powers. About 1277 
DR, he told a daring Harper who questioned him about this: "I prefer to 
watch the strivings of others and act only when I must. From time to 
time something within me stirs, and I rise up to work my will on Faerûn 
with vigorous energy . . . but those risings come seldom now; I must be 
growing old." </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Lurker's relationships with other dragons have been, in the words of 
the human sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate (fast becoming recognized as an
 authority on the history of dragons up and down the Sword Coast), "A 
parade of friendly hidings -- but ready deadliness." Put into everyday 
words, that means that Eldenser prefers to conceal himself from other 
dragons, reacts with calm friendliness if he is discovered -- and is 
quick and savage in battle if forced to defend himself (or his wielder).
 </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 key to Eldenser's character could be said to be his interest in the 
rich variety of Faerûn, as it unfolds all around him. He is patient, 
good-natured, and wise, able to draw on far more experience than most 
mortal beings, to outwit foes who plan ahead. He can cast prudence aside
 in an instant if he must, bursting into bold action, but he has no 
interest into luring or trapping others (though he may manipulate beings
 to aid his wielder, or merely to observe the result -- particularly if 
it is likely to reveal the character of someone he's interested in, 
perhaps as a possible wielder of the blade he's currently inhabiting). </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eldenser
 is said to be an accomplished mimic and to have a taste for riddles and
 puzzles. In recent years, he has become increasingly fascinated by love
 in all its forms, and what it can make beings do. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Worm Who Hides in Blades is said to be a foe of whoever's pestering him
 right now -- he doesn't bother pursuing anyone on an ongoing basis, 
though he'll certainly thwart the Cult of the Dragon whenever he can.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Eldenser's Lair </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Lurker has no known servants, willing or unwilling, but he is thought 
to enjoy an alliance with the Simbul, Witch-Queen of Aglarond, and 
possibly with her sisters Syluné and, surprisingly, Dove (who has 
wielded him from time to time in big battles against Zhentarim, Thayans,
 or other magically-powerful menaces). He seems to have no true lair but
 rather a dozen or more inaccessible sea-isle or mountain-heart caverns 
in which to "stash" his immobile, stasis-ruled body. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 most of the time, this body lies in a crypt in the City of the Dead. 
The tomb is reachable only by correctly passing through several trapped <i>portals</i>
 that fling the unwary to random destinations (for example, a deep level
 in Undermountain or the outskirts of ruined Myth Drannor) unless a user
 utters the correct passwords while traversing them. The crypt is 
rumored to contain wardmists or similar protective magical barriers, 
including helmed horrors or similar automaton guardians, but no precise 
details of such defenses are available. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Eldenser's Domain </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Inside
 blades, Eldenser roams all of Faerûn, considering none of it his 
"territory" but all of it his to traverse. He ignores nearby dragons of 
any breed -- unless they discover him, whereupon he cheerfully defies 
any attempts to establish authority over him (or anyone wielding the 
blade he currently inhabits). Eldenser usually has little interest in 
slaying other dragons of any sort, but he dislikes fleeing from them. He
 prefers to best other dragons or outwit them and then leave at his 
leisure, rather than allowing them to consider themselves victorious 
over him. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Eldenser </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 favorite prey of the Lurker is a great cat of any sort, though he 
usually feeds on cattle, and even derives nutrients from any gore he 
spills while inhabiting a blade. He is said to enjoy good wine and sharp
 cheeses as well.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 not known if Eldenser has ever mated with another dragon. He is known 
to have accompanied several human females -- and at least one elven lady
 -- for most of their lives, and to have formed friendships with heroic 
individuals of both genders and most intelligent races. At heart, 
though, he seems that rarest of things, even among dragons: a contented 
loner. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eldenser
 spends his days in three pursuits: observing the beauties of Faerûn and
 the entertaining strivings of its inhabitants (half-elves, humans, and 
elves in particular), trying to influence events in the same way that 
rulers and archmages do, and to follow Ossavitor's Way to fruition. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ossavitor
 was -- or is (it is now either dead or dwelling on another plane) -- a 
dragon of forgotten breed, who achieved something very important to all 
dragonkind some 20,000 years ago: his Way, or magical process for 
achieving immortality. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Humans
 are warned that betrayal of any knowledge of this process (even 
mentioning its name in "confidential" inquiries at Candlekeep, for 
example) will attract the attention of both the Cult of the Dragon (who 
are anxious to eliminate rivals in their bid to influence dragons into 
achieving dracolichdom) and powerful dragons of all sorts. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ossavitor's
 Way is a long, exacting, and difficult process, the details of which 
remain secret to this writer (in other words, Volo couldn't discover 
anything more about it, and Elminster refused to). Khelben "Blackstaff" 
Arunsun, the Lord Mage of Waterdeep (and presumably certain other 
powerful mages of his acquaintance, such as his consort Laeral and 
perhaps others of the Chosen of Mystra) has the entire process somewhere
 in one of his hidden libraries. Ambitious adventurers should take note 
that dragons -- after a long and increasingly impressive death-toll 
mounted alarmingly -- long ago gave up any hope of getting the secrets 
of Ossavitor from the Blackstaff.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What
 I have learned thus far is the end result of the process, and certain 
of its ingredients. The end result is practical immortality: It gives 
the dragon's sentience three bodies to inhabit (the unused two are in 
stasis, and typically hidden away in remote mountain caverns, buried 
under sand in the hearts of such vast deserts as the Plains of Purple 
Dust in Raurin, and so on), and allows the dragon to select the size and
 "age" of these bodies. The dragon retains its spell resistance and 
spells regardless of the apparent age of its form, but its size, Hit 
Dice, breath weapon, and the like vary with the age chosen. All of these
 newly created bodies are vigorous and have fast healing 3. How the 
dragon's sentience can move from one body to another also remains a 
mystery as of this writing, but the written evidence suggests that this 
can be done as often as desired, and with ease. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 process itself has been the hardest thing to unearth. I suspect that 
dragons or their agents, and folk of the Cult of the Dragon, have set 
about stealing or destroying as many references to the Way as possible. 
I'm confident that it involves gathering many draconic components, 
including the talon of a topaz dragon, a scale from a silver, some blood
 from a bronze, and so on. (Note: This confidence is Volo's, but 
Elminster did not correct this statement.) </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eldenser
 can be presumed to know (or to believe he knows) the entire Way, and to
 be pursuing the collection of components in a patient, almost leisurely
 manner. Certainly he has often influenced individuals who are wielding a
 blade he is part of to attack and slay dragons -- and if they are 
successful, to sever certain of their body parts which vanish at the 
blade's touch (presumably teleported away by a magic launched by 
Eldenser, to some secret hiding place).</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Amethyst Telekinesis</i> (Sp): </b>Once per day, Eldenser can use a <i>telekinesis</i>
 effect. With this ability, he can lift up to 10 tons (200,000 pounds), 
or hurl a creature against another object. The impact deals 20d6 points 
of damage to a Large creature, 15d6 to a Medium-size one, 10d6 to a 
Small one, 5d6 to a Tiny one, or 1d6 to a Diminutive or Fine creature.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Once
 every 1d4 rounds, Eldenser can breathe a 120-foot line of concussive 
force. Each creature in the affected area takes 24d8 points of damage 
(Reflex DC 35 half). He may choose to deal an equal amount of subdual 
damage instead of normal damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crush: </b>When
 flying or jumping, Eldenser can land on Medium-size or smaller 
opponents as a standard action, using his whole body to crush them. A 
crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under his body. Each 
creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 35) or 
be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+18 points of buldgeoning damage. 
Thereafter, if Eldenser chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a 
normal grapple attack (grapple bonus +63). While pinned, the opponent 
takes 4d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage each round.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Explosive Gem</i> (Sp): </b>Once
 per day, Eldenser can spit a crystalline violet lozenge up to 75 feet 
away with pinpoint accuracy. The gem explodes on impact, dealing 13d6 
points of impact damage to every creature in a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC
 29 half).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Frightful Presence (Su): </b>This
 ability takes effect automatically when Eldenser attacks, charges, or 
flies overhead. It affects only opponents with 38 or fewer Hit Dice or 
levels. Each affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 35) 
or become shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or more Hit Dice) or 
panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it has 4 or fewer Hit Dice or levels). 
Success indicates that the target is immune to Eldenser's frightful 
presence for one day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Psionics</i> (Sp): </b>3/day -- <i>stomp;</i> 1/day -- <i>invisibility, body equilibrium, suggestion.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tail Sweep:</b>
 Eldenser can sweep with his tail as a standard action. The sweep 
affects Small and smaller creatures within a 30-foot-diameter 
half-circle centered on the dragon's rear. Each affected creature that 
fails a Reflex save (DC 35) takes 2d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage; a
 successful save halves the damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b>
 Eldenser can ascertain his surroundings by nonvisual means (mostly 
hearing and scent, but also by noticing vibration and other 
environmental clues). This ability enables him to discern objects and 
creatures within a range of 360 feet. He usually does not need to make 
Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight
 ability.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Force Resistant (Ex): </b>Eldenser gains a +4 saving throw bonus against force-based psionic powers, spells, or effects.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Low-Light Vison (Ex): </b>Eldenser can see four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in normal light.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Planar Travel (Su): </b>Eldenser has the innate ability to pass instantly between the Material Plane and the Inner Planes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Psionic Abilities</i> (Sp): </b>Eldenser
 uses psionics as a 17th-level psion (savant). He knows the following 
powers (8/5/5/4/4/4/3/3/2; save DC 1d20 + key ability score + power 
level): 0 -- <i>control shadow</i>, <i>daze</i>, <i>detect psionics</i>, <i>far hand</i>, <i>missive</i>, <i>my light</i>, <i>talons</i>, <i>verve</i>; 1 -- <i>biocurrent, charm person</i>, <i>conceal thoughts</i>, <i>lesser body adjustment</i>, <i>minor creation</i>; 2 -- <i>aversion</i>, <i>body adjustment</i>, <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>sever the tie</i>; 3 -- <i>charm monster</i>, <i>control sound, improved biofeedback</i>, <i>mindlink</i>; 4 -- <i>amplified invisibility</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>dissolving touch</i>, <i>psychofeedback</i>; 5 -- <i>energy barrier, matter rearrangement, mind probe</i>, <i>steelsteal</i> (see below); 6 -- <i>breath of the dragon</i>, <i>bright and deadly ring</i> (see below),<i> disintegrate;</i> 7 -- <i>energy conversion</i>, <i>power turning</i>, <i>sequester</i>; 8 -- <i>matter manipulation,</i><i>shadow body</i>.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Eldenser's Fate </span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Though
 his pursuit of Ossavitor's Way can be described fairly as leisurely and
 almost unconcerned, with a high value placed on enjoying the full range
 of experiences Faerûn has to offer a patient observer, it seems likely 
Eldenser will achieve the near-immortality of the Way. He has been 
working on it for so long and taking such care over the details that (in
 Elminster's estimation, at least) he's only a last grace note or 
crowning touch away from being able to enact the Way. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 possible that Eldenser has achieved this state already and is simply 
reluctant to leave his present lifestyle. Perhaps he is trying to craft 
or discover psionics that will enable him to inhabit blades and travel 
between them and his three new bodies as freely as he does presently 
between his old, original body and the various weapons of which he has 
been a part. It is certain that he has spent a lot of time in and around
 Candlekeep and the Herald's Holdfast in recent years -- after having 
scoured both places centuries earlier for all references to the Way. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Against
 this rosy likelihood of success must be placed Eldenser's often 
dangerous lifestyle. More than most dragons, he places himself at risk 
often, and for extended periods of time. Only the gods can decide if ill
 fortune will find him before he enacts the Way -- and that brings to 
mind Volo's last note about the Worm Who Hides in Blades: There are many
 and persistent, but admittedly entirely unsubstantiated, rumors as to 
Eldenser being an ally or servant of this or that Faerûnian deity. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Elminster
 only smiled and shook his head when he read those lines, refusing to 
confirm or deny the truth of this. Instead, he pointed silently to 
Volo's very last words: "Bears watching. Keep an eye on this one -- if 
possible." </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Eldenser's Magic</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Lurker is thought to have learned and practiced many rare and strange 
spells. He has all of the psionic abilities of an amethyst great wyrm, 
but his precise mind-powers remain mysterious; Elminster believes that 
one of Eldenser's achievements is the ability to duplicate the effects 
of certain high-level powers he can unleash once per day, costing hit 
points instead of power points.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Two
 of Eldenser's abilities in particular are sought by other dragons (and 
by ambitious mages of Thay and the Cult of the Dragon), and these 
follow. (The descriptions of these powers are drawn from the notes in 
books of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, who apparently received them from
 Eldenser long ago in trade for magic.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bright and Deadly Ring<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Metacreativity (Int) [Force]<br><b>Level:</b> Psion 6 /Psychic Warrior 6<br><b>Display:</b> Au, Vi<br><b>Manifestation Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> 1 object or willing creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute/level or until discharged (D)<br><b>Power Resistence: </b>Yes</span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Power Points:</b> 11</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You create a ring of glowing blue-white energy around the target resembling <i>faerie fire</i>,
 which provides light equal to a candle. The ring extends 5 feet 
horizontally from the target. The ring moves with the target and does 
not interfere with its motion or abilities. The ring can be programmed 
with one of two effects:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Complete discharge:</i>
 The next enemy of the target that touches the ring discharges it, 
unleashing a pulse of force at the enemy that deals 11d6 points of force
 damage. This ends the power immediately.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Staggered discharge:</i>
 As above, except each time the ring is touched by an enemy, it releases
 only a portion of its energy chosen by you (such as 3d6, 2d6, 1d6, and 
so on). The ring remains until it has released 11d6 dice of damage, at 
which point the power ends.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Steelsteal<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Psychoportation (Dex)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level:</b> Psion 5<br><b>Display:</b> None<br><b>Manifestation Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level or until you return to your body (D) (see text)<br><b>Power Points:</b> 9</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 free your spirit from your body, allowing you to travel as an 
incorporeal creature and inhabit metallic blades (such as daggers, 
swords, and so on). While incorporeal, you cannot make attacks or use 
any abilities, but you can fly at speed 30 (perfect). You do not carry 
any equipment with you but gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to your 
Charisma bonus. You can remain incorporeal for up to 3 rounds in 
succession, after which the power ends and your spirit returns to its 
body. When incorporeal, you are affected by spells and powers that ward 
or harm such disembodied spirits or possession attempts, such as <i>magic circle against evil</i>, which prevents you from entering or attempting to possess any blade within the area.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While
 incorporeal, you can overlap a metallic blade with your incorporeal 
form and enter it fully. While "possessing" the blade in this manner, 
you can see, hear, and feel as well as a normal human. You can speak and
 use any powers or abilities you have that don't require somatic or 
material components (therefore psionic abilities function normally). You
 cannot move the blade unless you have magic or psionics that allow you 
to move objects (such as <i>far hand</i>, <i>skate</i>, or <i>telekinesis</i>).
 You can remain within a blade indefinitely, subject to the duration of 
the power. As a standard action you can vacate the blade and become 
incorporeal again, or transfer directly between two blades in physical 
contact at the time. A blade possessed by you can bypass damage 
reduction as if it had a +2 enhancement bonus, but it does not gain any 
bonuses to hit or damage. Damaging the blade causes you no harm, and 
destroying it merely returns you to your incorporeal form. At any time 
you can end the power as a standard action and immediately return to 
your body.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 you attempt to possess an intelligent blade, the blade resists and you 
must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = item's ego). Success means you 
possess the blade and can use its abilities in addition to your own (so 
if the weapon could <i>teleport</i> once per day, you could activate 
that ability and teleport yourself and the blade to your choice of 
locations). Failure means you possess the blade but cannot use its 
abilities or any of your own (you are essentially a passenger), although
 you can still leave the blade normally.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Your
 body remains behind, unconscious. Effects on your body (such as poison,
 disease, and so on) continue while you are away, and because your body 
is still alive, it still needs air, water, and food. If your body is 
killed, you die.</span></p>
