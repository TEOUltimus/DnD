<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many
 have chanted those grim lines over a kindling fire in the Sword Coast 
North, because doing so is supposed to ward off beasts that see the 
blaze from afar. Most minstrels think "The Dragon Unseen" is no more 
than an impressive warning phrase, a clever bardic creation . . . but 
bards -- and all too many corpses -- have found the truth to be very 
different.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 the Unseen is a wily male sapphire dragon -- "very old" as humans 
measure the years of dragons -- who is rarely seen outside his lair. He 
lurks in its depths, devouring creatures of the Underdark (drow 
warbands, for example) who endlessly blunder into the caverns he calls 
home. He plots as he paces in the darkness, scheming out how -- without 
ever leaving his caverns -- he can achieve covert control over the 
pitiful but potentially dangerous human organization known as the Cult 
of the Dragon.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once
 Malaeragoth served the wizard Uvalkhur the Undaunted as an occasional 
steed. It was a partnership he enjoyed, for he never ventured out into 
the sunlit skies of the surface world unless he had Uvalkhur on his 
back. The sardonic young wizard was an expert guide who didn't mind 
taking detours to show his curious aerial steed scorching deserts or 
frigid wastes.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Uvalkhur
 was the son of a rich Sembian merchant, much enmeshed in the intrigues 
of the wealthy merchants of that land. As his enemies grew, his need for
 swift journeys grew with it, and he called on Malaeragoth often. He 
didn't seem to mind that the dragon beneath him took close and 
persistent interest in spellbooks and the occasional magic Uvalkhur 
unleashed.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Over
 the years, Malaeragoth learned a little about spells, a little more 
about the use and handling of magic items, and much about Sembian 
politics and the players in its frenetic and rather dirty games, which 
Uvalkhur especially hated. The Cult of the Dragon, for instance, were 
forever hounding young wizards to join the Cult or at least to lend it 
magical assistance . . . or else face the "righteous and justified 
wrath" of the Followers of the Scaly Way. Regardless of a wizardling's 
reaction, they spread the word that he or she was now a loyal Cult 
member, and all Cultists could call on the wizardling for aid or 
sponsorship -- and any refusal would make the wizardling subject to Cult
 justice.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 expensive to be a wizard in Sembia. Well, it's expensive to be just 
about anyone in Sembia, but the training and components involved in 
spellcasting restrict wizardry to the very wealthy or the duly 
accomplished. That meant most of the rising wizards were young nobles 
(that is, the sons of established wealthy merchant families).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Cult of the Dragon, on the other hand, was largely composed of 
ambitious non-nobles; clawing at every wizard in sight was a good way of
 weakening the influence of the nobility and increasing the reputation 
of the Cult. It was also a good way to make enemies -- but if your foes 
fear you, you can often force them to react in certain ways, giving you a
 measure of control over them. And as Uvalkhur put it, "the Sembian 
Cultists love every measure of control they can squeeze out of Faerûn 
around them."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There
 came a summer morning when Uvalkhur, no longer young, was attacked in 
his manor house in northern Sembia by bold Cultists bent on plunder and 
punishment. The battle that followed brought death to many, but after 
the Undaunted had been hacked apart on his best carpet at the heart of 
his spell-chambers, enough Cultists remained alive to shout victorious 
triumph to the skies and loot all the magic items and spellbooks they 
could find.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Unfortunately
 for their continued health, they lingered too long over intricate 
sliding panels and the wine bottles in the ambries behind some of them, 
thinking that Uvalkhur's last cries had been vain entreaties and not a 
summons to the only ally he could call. When Malaeragoth plunged down 
out of the sky, he saw at once what had happened and tore what was left 
of the manor apart as a child tears open the wrappings of a gift to 
reach the Cultists within.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What
 he left of the ruined manor house still stands, overgrown by its 
orchards, northwest of Saerb. Its riven walls have been further 
despoiled over the years by scavengers in search of magic, but phantom 
wizards and leucrotta have kept casual explorers away. Not much is left 
for even the most diligent seeker to find, anyway; Malaeragoth bore away
 from House Undaunted chests of potions and books, a cabinet full of 
scrolls, all the items from which he'd recalled seeing Uvalkhur unleash 
magic . . . and a powerful hatred of the Cult of the Dragon.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 rest of that summer, the sapphire wyrm indulged his rage, hunting down 
Cultists across Sembia to avenge his sometime master. That ended one 
autumn night when he was burned and blasted by the frantic spells of 
three Cult wizards working together. Their magic sent him rolling into a
 pond, his lashing tail inadvertently flicking barrels of oil into fires
 ignited in battle. The explosion that followed tore apart the Cult 
stronghold he'd attacked, sent smoke rising to the stars, and hurled two
 of his wizard foes to their deaths, broken on the stones of the walled 
manor where they'd made their stand. None saw the wounded dragon crawl 
out of the pond and up a rocky slope.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 journey back to his lair was long and painful, and Malaeragoth vowed 
he'd never stand against wizards in open battle again. As he lay healing
 and trying to master magic in the dark caverns of his lair, he used 
Uvalkhur's scrying mirror to watch Cult members and their doings, and he
 vowed revenge upon them all. Yet his wounds were great, and they kept 
him idle in the dark for months. Nor did the learning of magic go 
swiftly, though he found that he understood magic and could divine ways 
to reshape it to his bidding. It occurred to him, as he lay upon his bed
 of coins, that he was the very thing diligent Cultists went seeking. To
 draw them to him was too risky; he'd be inviting a battle into his home
 and abandoning all safety and privacy forever. Perhaps he could act as 
the senior Cultists did, issuing orders and sending one group of agents 
to spy on another. . . .</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 set about trying to manipulate the Cult into serving him, and he found 
that it worked. At first he merely sent them to a variety of fiendish 
traps for his own amusement. Later he realized that the surviving 
Cultists could do useful things for him such as carrying out tasks a 
dragon couldn't and sparing him the danger of long travel away from his 
lair. His early attempts proved so successful that the Unseen Dragon set
 to work in earnest on learning impersonations, mind-reading and 
mind-controlling spells, and the workings of human society (and the 
desires and characters of humans) in the North. Thus he trained to 
control Cult members without their being aware of his manipulation. He 
succeeded with ridiculous ease. Almost disbelieving, he set additional 
schemes in motion and watched them succeed. Cult members were indeed too
 chaotic for words.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 he set to work to master magic, Malaeragoth found himself with two 
pastimes: reshaping his lair and manipulating the Cult. Over the years 
since, he has largely altered his lair to the way he wants it. 
Influencing the Cult has progressed to the point where he can see his 
way clear to controlling it eventually.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nowadays,
 Malaeragoth prides himself on leaving no hints to his identity when he 
destroys Cult members, and on wiping out all tracing spells that might 
find him by means of the treasure he seizes. Cult members are only now 
aware that someone or something that does not like them is at work in an
 area roughly bounded by Scornubel to the Shining Falls, and the Lonely 
Moor to Uluvin -- but as yet none of them knows it is a dragon.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 takes an almost childlike glee in misleading Cultists as to his true 
nature and in deftly increasing his influence over them; covertly 
achieving control of the Cult has become his great passion and 
entertainment.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">More
 often whispered of in the Underdark than on the surface of Faerûn, 
Malaeragoth takes delight not in an impressive reputation (as most wyrms
 do) but in remaining hidden and unknown, truly Unseen. He avoids even 
the company of his own kind and hides to avoid unnecessary contact. He 
has a natural aptitude for and grasp of magic, and he knows the general 
topography of Faerûn from aloft. He is otherwise ignorant of much lore, 
and his scrying of surface society is almost entirely concerned with the
 intrigues of Sembia and the activities of the Cult of the Dragon.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 is itching to make use of his knowledge of the Realm of Rolling Coins 
by means of investments, but he lacks an agent he can trust and doesn't 
want to spend time away from his caverns -- though he can assume the 
shape and manners of Sembian merchants with uncanny accuracy, should he 
be moved to do so. When adventuring bands or exploring dragons come 
seeking him, he often successfully masquerades as a lost, wandering 
human in need of their aid -- until the right moment to attack with his 
full draconic form and powers.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Watching
 and scheming consume his days. Through years spent in this way, 
Malaeragoth has developed patience and a sense of humor. The hot rising 
springs that run through his lair slake his thirst, and he dines on 
creatures of the Underdark who intrude on his lair, flocks of wildfowl 
who alight to sleep on the High Moor (scrying them, he swoops on them by
 night, awakening them and gulping huge numbers in the air as they 
flutter aloft in a huge mass), and the creatures produced by eight 
captive deepspawn that he keeps walled away in a network of 
mushroom-bedizened caverns that he opens only to enter and feed.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Malaeragoth's Lair</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Unseen dwells in a huge network of caverns beneath the Graypeak 
Mountains. Some of these subterranean chambers are natural and bring hot
 and foaming streams up from the depths to join the River Shining. 
Others are the halls and passages of a long-abandoned dwarven delve, its
 short and narrow ways blasted to larger tunnels by the spells of the 
Unseen. Traps and chasms are commonplace, and once-rough walls have been
 scoured and worn smooth by the passing bulk of the dragon who now rules
 here, stretching often like a gigantic and restless scaled cat but 
seldom emerging into the world beyond what he calls his "Realm of Stone 
and Shadow."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 keeps several "arms," which are dead-end strings of caverns walled off 
with huge rocks, for special purposes. One such arm is flooded and holds
 reserve water. Another is lit by the endless, silent flashes of many 
gems: the much-prized beljurils. Scrying mirrors drift slowly along the 
passages of the Realm of Stone and Shadow, like upright oval stone 
shields, their soft green-white surfaces flickering. Malaeragoth uses 
them to spy on the world outside, regularly scanning the lands around 
his lair, but bending the major part of his attention upon distant 
Sembia and the deeds of the Cult of the Dragon, wherever he detects or 
follows them.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Skeletons
 and zombies fetch and carry at Malaeragoth's bidding. If his lair is 
attacked by large groups of beings, he'll direct these undead to roll 
waiting, massed crushing boulders down on invaders in particular shafts 
or areas. The undead are otherwise walled away in unlit side-caverns to 
keep them out of the way of the Unseen Dragon's slow pacings. He enjoys 
solitude and taking slow walks through the caverns worn smooth by years 
of his passage, as he murmurs thoughts, comments, and unfolding schemes 
aloud (although he'll never do so when he knows guests are anywhere in 
his lair) and watches a scrying mirror that's drifting along with him.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 has no other servitors or allies, although he sometimes poses as this 
or that human and uses his scrying mirror to seek advice from various 
distant surface folk (or to manipulate them with offers of deals or the 
real or false news he imparts).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Malaeragoth's Domain</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Save
 for his extensive lair "realm," Malaeragoth claims and patrols no 
territory but considers himself free to travel at will around surface 
Faerûn. He won't hesitate to fight if he encounters anyone barring or 
disputing his way on his rare forays out "under the sun." He does keep 
watch over the approaches to his lair, both on the surface and in the 
Underdark, having developed an intense dislike of surprise guests and 
visitations.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">The Deeds of Malaeragoth</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Malaeragoth
 eats and drinks as he sees the need, but takes no delight in devouring 
or hunting. He hates no dragons or anyone beyond Cult members, but he

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 dealings of merchants fascinate Malaeragoth, and he never tires of 
observing them. He hungers to take an ever-greater hand in secretly 
"steering" events in whatever direction he desires. First, make the Cult
 of the Dragon his unwitting puppets, then begin to manipulate factions 
and individuals -- everyone except priests and wizards who might well 
detect him -- in realms everywhere across Faerûn. . . .</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once every 1d4 rounds, Malaeragoth can breathe a 50-foot cone of sonic 
energy that deals 18d4 points of sonic damage to every creature in the 
area (Reflex DC 30 half). Each creature within the cone must also make a
 Fortitude save (DC 30) or be deafened for 1d4 rounds.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crush (Ex):</b>
 When flying or jumping, Malaeragoth can land on Small or smaller 
creatures as a standard action, using his whole body to crush them. A 
crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under Malaeragoth's 
body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save 
(DC 30) or be pinned, automatically taking 2d8+15 points of bludgeoning 
damage. Thereafter, if Malaeragoth chooses to maintain the pin (grapple 
bonus +47), treat it as a normal grapple attack. While pinned, the 
opponent takes crush damage each round.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b>
 This ability takes effect automatically when Malaeragoth attacks, 
charges, or flies overhead. It affects only opponents with 28 or fewer 
Hit Dice or levels within a radius of 270 feet. Each affected creature 
must make a successful Will save (DC 30) to resist the effect. On a 
failure, a creature with 5 or more Hit Dice or levels becomes shaken for
 4d6 rounds, and a creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice or levels becomes 
panicked for 4d6 rounds. Success indicates that the target is immune to 
Malaeragoth's frightful presence for one day.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px;"><b>Malaeragoth's Fate</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Unseen Dragon is playing a dangerous game. His continued success 
depends on his existence remaining unsuspected, or at least his 
whereabouts and identity staying unknown. As Elminster observes, "No one
 -- gods or mortals -- can remain hidden forever." The Old Mage suspects
 that Malaeragoth of the Realm of Stone and Shadow will come to a 
violent doom when his meddlings go too far, or when they touch the wrong
 being. Most of the Chosen know of his existence, and Elminster suspects
 at least one Red Wizard is watching over the Unseen Dragon in much the 
same way as Malaeragoth watches over the strivings and intrigues of 
Sembia and the Cult.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 massed Cult of the Dragon, should it bring all of its force to bear in 
concert -- and avoid most of the traps of the dragon's realm -- should 
alone destroy Malaeragoth. On the other hand, Elminster observed in dry 
tones, it might well take the direct power and guidance of a god to make
 all the Cult do anything together.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">Malaeragoth's Magic</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some
 of the wands that the Unseen Dragon salvaged from House Undaunted are 
rare and powerful "acid-hurling death wands," as foes call them (<i>wands of energy substitution (acid) fireball</i>,
 caster level 10); the same sort of weapon possessed by the dragon 
Lhammaruntosz. Whereas the Claws of the Coast commands (so far as is 
known) only one such item, Malaeragoth owns at least four. This may well
 be the largest collection of this sort of wand anywhere; Elminster says
 very few such weapons still exist due to their inherent instability.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Unseen Dragon has developed several interesting spells from the tomes 
he took from the ruins of his master's house; three of the most 
interesting of these follow. Due to his research (into spells beyond his
 present capabilities, in particular), Malaeragoth's understanding and 
recognition of spells cast by other creatures is extensive.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Ball of Fangs<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evocation [Force]</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Components:</b> V</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Area:</b> 10-ft.-radius burst</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 create a sphere of whirling, fanglike translucent blades of force that 
burst outward from a single point to a 10-foot-radius sphere. Creatures 
within the sphere take 1d6 points of force damage per caster level 
(maximum 10d6). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Breathbarb<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Transmutation</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Components:</b> V</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Range:</b> Short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Effect:</b> One crystal lozenge (see text)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Duration:</b> 1 day/level (see text)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> See text</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (see text)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 cast this spell, and on your next turn if you use your breath weapon, 
the spell traps the breath weapon into a gemlike lozenge 5 feet long and
 1 feet in diameter, which floats and spins in midair. If you do not use
 a breath weapon before the end of your next turn or the breath weapon 
is of the kind that does not deal damage, this spell ends without 
effect. You may handle and move the lozenge as easily as an object of 
some infinitesimal weight. You must touch the lozenge to move it, and 
you cannot throw it. If any other creature touches it or if a creature 
comes within 5 feet of it, it triggers the release of the spell (see 
below).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 triggered, the lozenge explodes in a 20-foot-radius burst, releasing 
harmless sparks and the power of the breath weapon trapped within it. 
Any creature caught in this area suffers the effects of the breath 
weapon (maximum 5d8 points of damage) as if you had just breathed upon 
them; normal saving throws apply (using the DC of the breath weapon, not
 this spell). Creatures with spell resistance can ignore the effect of 
the explosion if you fail a spell penetration check against them. (Even 
though breath weapons are not usually subject to spell resistance, the 
influence of this spell on your breath weapon is enough to allow spell 
resistance to affect it.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A <i>breathbarb</i>
 crystal cannot be used as a normal gem for any purpose (including as a 
material or focus component for a spell). Dispelling the spell or 
otherwise ending the duration of <i>breathbarb</i> causes the gem to 
explode and release the trapped breath weapon. If the duration expires 
normally, the gem fades and does not release the breath weapon.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Note:</b> Magic traps such as <i>breathbarbs</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the <i>breathbarb</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>breathbarb</i>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Sapphire Psionic Shield<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Abjuration</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Components:</b> V</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Target:</b> 1 creature</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 shroud the target in a flickering, heatless, sapphire-colored aura that
 lights up the target with weak radiation equal to only half the 
illumination of a normal torch (10 feet). This aura protects the target 
against possession and mental control exactly like a <i>protection from evil</i> spell. The target also gains a +4 resistance bonus to saving throws against all mind-affecting effects and psionic attacks.</span></p>
