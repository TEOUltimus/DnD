 Wyrm Who Watches is known to only a few folk of the North. Almost all 
of them, outside of a particular Waterdhavian noble family, think he's 
just a fanciful character in an old fairy tale that purports to explain 
why some noble families of Waterdeep are so wealthy. Volo learned rather
 more in a tenday dalliance with the young Lady Ravithara Silmerhelve --
 but as Elminster commented, "If Lord Laerlos Silmerhelve ever reads 
this, there won't be a fortress strong enough or distant enough in all 
Toril to save the skin of Volothamp Geddarm from the vengeance of the 
Silmerhelves. I hear Ravithara wants the father of her baby to return to
 her side, too." </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It
 should be noted before we continue that the child, Emmeros Silmerhelve,
 is a strong baby boy who'd have to see more than a dozen of his kin die
 before he ever became head of the house; he'd not be in the direct line
 of succession even if his father were an honored noble openly married 
to Ravithara (a fourth cousin to Lord Laerlos). He is, according to 
Elminster, blessed with Volo's unmistakable, er, "good looks." </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nymmurh
 is a figure almost as elusive as the father of Emmeros. This ancient 
bronze he-dragon has crafted several magic mirrors and portraits in the 
Silmerhelve family mansion in Waterdeep and in several outbuildings of 
their country estate, Helvenblade House, northwest of Westbridge. These 
looking-glasses and pictures now serve Nymmurh as constantly operating 
scrying "portholes." He can see, hear, and speak through them at will, 
though the mirrors and pictures show no sign of his presence beyond a 
strong but invisible magical aura. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 Nymmurh desires to show himself to observers "on the other side," he 
need only perform a simple (and almost instantaneous) manipulation of 
the permanent scrying magic. The mirror or portrait shimmers for an 
instant, then reveals the head of the kindly dragon "beyond" the wall. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 portholes provide Nymmurh with a constant source of entertainment, as 
the Silmerhelves live their lives under his watchful gaze. He reveals 
himself to at least one family member of each generation, so he can 
guide the Silmerhelves with timely advice and learn news from them. 
(Family members in the know often position themselves within view of a 
known porthole for gossip and important family conferences or 
confrontations.) Nymmurh's habit of keeping himself secret from most 
Silmerhelves means that he can surprise treacherous or foolish family 
members when he acts against them, and he keeps general knowledge of his
 own existence in the "family legend" category rather than "known family
 weapon" that outsiders can anticipate. Through the generations Nymmurh 
has aided many Silmerhelves, usually younger sons who go adventuring, 
but on many occasions the same individuals when they're in their gray 
years. Nymmurh has taken more than one family patriarch or matriarch on a
 magnificent "last ride," flying them on his back through vicious storms
 over the Sea of Swords until lightning slays them. In return, the 
Silmerhelves have come to Nymmurh's aid when his lair is threatened or 
when a marauding dragon has wounded him in battle. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One of the greatest treasures of the Silmerhelves, an elven <i>stormsword</i> (described in <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i>
 Annual #1), is a gift from Nymmurh. Tales of Silmerhelves coming back 
from the dead to defend loved ones or to protect them during perilous 
trips are the work of the bronze dragon who is using his magic to take 
on human form. He is also not above covertly arranging matches for young
 Silmerhelve daughters.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nymmurh can scry all of the Silmerhelve <i>portals</i>
 constantly; according to Elminster, their "other ends" ring the main 
cavern of his lair like so many floating crystal balls. He has <i>portals</i>
 at all gates to Silmerhelve properties, in at least one cellar of each 
home, and wherever there are ovens, large cooking hearths, or 
heating-fires (so he can cry alarm if fire, theft, or imminent attack 
threaten). Sound travels freely through Nymmurh's <i>portals</i>, so he 
can bellow and be heard in the Silmerhelve abode. Often he mischievously
 speaks in ghostly whispers or imitates someone who's elsewhere, to 
alarm visitors who are nosing about where they shouldn't be. Sometimes 
he'll make them think someone is coming or even trick individuals into 
thinking certain persons are in love with them; he knows reams of love 
poems and will quote them using the voice of a particular Silmerhelve, 
addressing them to someone he knows can hear. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Wyrm Who Watches can also allow things to pass through a <i>portal</i> by calling on its magic to shape a temporary <i>portal</i>.
 This allows him, another creature, or an object or collection of items 
smaller in total volume than Nymmurh to travel through the mirror or 
portrait in either direction. Travel is accomplished merely by touching 
the mirror or portrait; travelers need not pass (or be able to fit) 
through its frame. If Nymmurh hasn't activated this ability, nothing 
happens beyond normal contact with a solid object, when any part of the <i>portal</i> mirror or portrait is touched. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Such <i>portal</i>
 travel is always safe but has the side effect of "turning off" any 
active magic on or surrounding something that passes through a <i>portal</i>.
 Prepared spells, quiescent magical powers, and magical effects that are
 present but inactive aren't affected, and if active magic can be made 
quiescent without ending or destroying them, the <i>portal</i> does so. 
Nymmurh has used this property to whisk beings safely to his lair, send 
items to a Silmerhelve, and even to enter Silmerhelve homes himself. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If no urgent need exists, the bronze dragon uses other means of transport; making a "<i>portal</i>
 trip" ruins the magical link between the mirror or portrait and its 
scrying-globe in his lair, causing the latter to collapse. The spells 
that create a new one and link it to the <i>portal</i> once more can be 
done entirely from Nymmurh's lair, but they are long, exacting, and 
expensive (in terms of rare, hard-to-obtain ingredients that usually 
involve hired adventurers -- all of whom Nymmurh deals with while in 
human form, and some of whom are sent after unnecessary ingredients, to 
keep the list of crucial ones secret). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As a hatchling, Nymmurh was whimsical, good-natured, and curious, especially about humans. He stumbled on the <i>portal</i>
 magic -- about which Volo could learn almost nothing, and about which 
Elminster could add scarcely more -- in the lair of an already-dead 
dragon. Who that dragon was, and where that lair lies, are secrets 
Nymmurh has never revealed. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The bronze dragon promptly used the <i>portals</i>
 to learn all he could about humans by observation. First mentioned in 
Silmerhelve family diary entries written in the first year of 
Northreckoning, The Wyrm Who Watches apparently chose the Waterdhavian 
family purely at random. Down the years, Nymmurh has from time to time 
covertly opened other <i>portals</i> in other places. Fear of discovery, being traced back to his lair, and the necessity to visit the "other" side of the <i>portal</i> to create the link has kept non-Silmerhelve <i>portals</i>
 rare and caused Nymmurh to destroy or close those he doesn't deem 
necessary. The bronze dragon desired to learn about humans because he 
saw them as the "great shaping force" that would rule over or influence 
all of Faerûn during his lifetime and he wanted to know how humans think
 and act. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now
 a great wyrm of age-paling scales and increasing lassitude (he naps 
often, sometimes for long periods), Nymmurh is an expert in human 
nature, including changing fashions and thought among Waterdhavian 
upper-class humans over a span of more than a thousand years. He knows 
thousands of human jokes, songs, and rhymes, and has even advised the 
human sage (and authority-on-dragons) Velsaert of Baldur's Gate about 
the nature of dragons and recent Sword Coast draconic doings. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">According
 to Velsaert, Nymmurh views other dragons much as he views humans: as 
potentially dangerous sources of entertainment it's prudent to learn all
 he can about. Nymmurh tries to hide his existence from other dragons as
 much as possible, swooping down on his larder-isle to feed by night, 
and otherwise almost never venturing out of his lair in dragon form. He 
employs a variety of "favorite" human forms that he sometimes uses when 
speaking through a <i>portal</i> to conceal his draconic nature. If he 
wants to conceal his true form from someone, he usually takes the shape 
of a Silmerhelve ancestor and does what he calls "the haunted portrait 
trick," acting as the long-dead Silmerhelve whose portrait he's staring 
out of, while wearing his or her face. If he wants personally to visit a
 Silmerhelve house, he usually takes the form of the mumbling-mad Lady 
Saerista Silmerhelve (of whom more is said below). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 key to Nymmurh's character could be his constant need to learn more 
about Toril around him, and its human inhabitants in particular. Even 
after an age of watching and observing, the bronze dragon is still 
fascinated by what humans get up to, and why and how predictable and 
unpredictable they can be. He loves to experiment (in a kindly, 
ready-to-correct-his-own-mistakes manner) with manipulating the 
Silmerhelves, to see if he can affect human fortunes and make humans 
more as he'd like them to be: kinder, gentler, wiser, and slower to act 
before consequences are considered -- and far friendlier to bronze 
dragons. He also likes to try to guess what lies ahead in the broader 
sweep of realms rising and falling, advances in trade and technology, 
and so on, finding it all very entertaining. He has no need to rule or 
dominate, and he finds no joy in outwitting or trapping others; Nymmurh 
loves to watch from the background, unnoticed and unmolested by his own 
kind and other passing predators. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He's
 known to be an accomplished mimic and a persuasive speaker, able to 
"convince folk right out of their stockings" (as Elminster put it) and 
to successfully impersonate folk more or less at will: that is, to make 
people believe he's a merchant of Amn or an escaped slave from Thay, not
 the wizard Elminster or Bloskrin Thuulbrin, Fine Fur-Dealer 
Extraordinaire from Westgate. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Nymmurh's Lair </span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 bronze dragon's lair is located high among the most inaccessible peaks 
of Alaron. From there he raids the High Moor and one of the islands in 
the Korinn Archipelago (which he long ago stocked with hardy goats) for 
food. The bronze dragon affectionately refers to his cluttered 
labyrinth-of-caverns home as "the Pit." This has caused some adventurers
 over the years, a-hunting dragon treasure, to mistakenly seek deeper 
delvings. (Usually they find meenlock-haunted mines in the vicinity and 
come to grief if they're not smart enough to flee before being 
surrounded and overwhelmed in the lightless passages.) </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Pit is a large and intricate network of caverns, a dozen of which are 
large enough for Nymmurh to laze or glide around in, in his own form. 
They can be reached by a shaft that leads straight up through the heart 
of a lofty peak, but which the bronze dragon guards with a large grating
 of sharp, 40-ft.-long spikes that menace anyone falling or flying down 
the shaft. The grate can swing downward and into a side-alcove, out of 
the way, but it is almost always locked in place, a forest of deadly 
blades that prevents dragons from dropping in uninvited. Made by titans 
long ago for a now-destroyed fortress of their own, the grate consists 
of many smaller spears and swords fixed upright between the huge blades,
 so as to endanger creatures of all sizes larger than a fox or hawk. It 
is smeared with pitch so as to retain a cloak of powder (a mixture of 
natural substances that neutralize acids), and it bears a permanent <i>globe of invulnerability</i> spell. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 side-passages and caverns of the Pit are smaller -- too small for a 
full-grown bronze dragon. One of these tangled networks of ways leads 
some miles away, to a connection with the surface: a small cave-entrance
 under the waters of a cold, swiftly-flowing mountain river. This cave 
is inhabited, and guarded for Nymmurh in return for gifts of food, by 
Annaclathaer, a marl (a snakelike aquatic multilimbed sentient 
creature). Their long-standing agreement has become a firm friendship, 
and if the marl breaks a magic glass "signal chime" Nymmurh gave him, 
and the bronze dragon is at home to hear it, the great wyrm speeds to 
Annaclathaer's aid, ready to fight any foe. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 smaller caverns of the Pit are crammed with odd, old items of all 
kinds; Nymmurh is an incurable collector of souvenirs. When he attends a
 revel, he'll bring back his empty glass or a lace doily; after 
matchmaking a pair of Silmerhelves into their first kiss, he's quite 
likely to tear up and take away the stone cemetery bench in the City of 
the Dead that they met upon. Fragments of boats that were wrecked on the
 rocky coasts near his home (or upon the isle where he keeps larder) are
 here, some spilling out their ballast-stones or long-perished cargoes. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 magic items and true treasure are both rare among all the clutter, they
 do exist, hidden away in side caverns reached only by dint of a lot of 
heaving aside items and clambering over others. Nymmurh once helped a 
foolish young Silmerhelve pay off a debt by showing up with thousands of
 gold pieces (which he dumped around the creditor in an imprisoning ring
 while in dragon form, just to impress everyone involved) and has on 
several occasions gifted Silmerhelve couples, at their nuptials, with 
small but useful magic items. Two stone golems (salvaged from ruins) 
stand hidden among all the heaped items, ready to attack intruders at 
the dragon's command. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nymmurh's
 Pit has one other resident: the mumbling-mad Lady Saerista Silmerhelve,
 rescued by the Wyrm Who Watches from the cooking-spit of the orc patrol
 who captured her. Saerista can be unnerving, but she's harmless, not a 
suddenly-murderous maniac. When not in one of her rare lucid moments, 
she shuffles about whispering to herself, her gown in revealing rags and
 her hair an unkempt, dusty forest. Saerista has seen some sixty winters
 and is quite content to remain in the Pit, eating what Nymmurh brings 
her, reading books from among all the heaped belongings, and exploring 
those belongings in an endless excavation of wonders. She knows who and 
what Nymmurh is, and that he's "the Guardian of the Silmerhelves" -- and
 privately considers him a disguised god who rescued her out of 
kindness. If she can ever find some way to repay him, she will. Her 
treatment by the orcs drove her from befuddlement to outright madness, 
and she's often completely unaware of the world around her. At such 
times, she's quite likely to speak in many strange voices, as if a dozen
 different folk were sharing her skull. Anyone who threatens or attacks 
Nymmurh when she's around, however, might disagree with that judgment.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Nymmurh's Domain</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nymmurh
 ignores the concept of domains, cheerfully roaming the North (the Sword
 Coast and its near-offshore isles in particular) regardless of what 
other dragons may dwell nearby or claim the territories he traverses. 
The only areas he'll defend against intruding dragons or other creatures
 are his own lair and his larder island. He regards the Silmerhelves as 
under his protection, but he won't diligently watch over young wayward 
family members out seeking their fortunes; he looks after those who 
aren't engaged in "discovering themselves" and doesn't regard himself 
responsible for the survival and successes of each individual 
Silmerhelve. If the family is ever threatened with sudden extinction, he
 plans to swoop in and kidnap a few family members to hide them far away
 so they can continue the family line while he makes things safe in 
Waterdeep for their eventual return. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Nymmurh</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Like
 most of his kind, Nymmurh favors shark meat above other fare, but this 
only leads him into occasional plunges down to join a "feeding frenzy" 
shark gathering he observes when flying over. Largely disinterested in 
food, Nymmurh is content to dine on the goats of his larder isle, though
 he takes a keen interest in procuring a varied and interesting diet for
 his "guest" Saerista, so he is constantly trading coins he comes by for
 bottled sauces and pickled oddities to bring home to the Pit for her. 
Nymmurh spends more time observing Faerûn through his Silmerhelve 
portholes than anything else, but he does go on forays every tenday or 
so, to "gather things" and "get out and breath air as humans do." This 
air often seems to be the smoky, over-perfumed sort that prevails at 
revels; Nymmurh loves human parties for all the chatter and how folk 
behave when they're tipsy or trying to impress or being deliberately 
catty or outrageous.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So
 far as is known, Nymmurh has never taken a mate or shown any interest 
in having offspring or even acquiring alliances with other dragons. 
Acquiring things is a hunger in him, but not necessarily keeping them --
 and the things need not be "treasure" as most creatures regard it. An 
interesting whittled tankard-coaster would catch his eye over a pile of 
gold pieces. </span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once every 1d4 rounds, Nymmurh can breathe a 120-foot line of 
lightning. Each creature in the path of the lightning takes 20d6 points 
of electricity damage (Reflex DC half).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crush (Ex): </b>When
 flying or jumping, Nymmurh can land on Medium or smaller opponents as a
 standard action, using his whole body to crush them. His crush attack 
affects a 20-foot-by-20-foot area. Each creature in the affected area 
must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 33) or be pinned, automatically taking
 4d6+16 points of bludgeoning damage each round that it remains pinned. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex):</b>
 Nymmurh can unsettle foes with his mere presence. This ability takes 
effect automatically whenever he attacks, charges, or flies overhead. 
Each creature within a 300-foot radius that has fewer than 33 HD is 
subject to the effect. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a
 Will save (DC 33) remains immune to Nymmurh's frightful presence for 24
 hours. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD becomes panicked for
 4d6 rounds, and one with 5 or more HD becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. A 
panicked creature takes a -2 morale penalty on saving throws and must 
flee. A shaken creature takes a -2 morale penalty on attack rolls, 
checks, and saving throws. Nymmurh ignores the frightful presence of 
other dragons.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>speak with animals;</i> 3/day -- <i>control water, create food and water, detect thoughts, fog cloud.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spells:</b> Nymmurh casts spells as a 15th-level sorcerer.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tail Sweep (Ex):</b>
 As a standard action, Nymmurh can sweep with his tail, affecting a 
half-circle with a radius of 30 feet extending from an intersection on 
the edge of his space in any direction. Each Small or smaller creature 
within the swept area takes 2d6+16 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex 
DC 33 half).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b>
 Nymmurh can assume any animal or humanoid form of Medium size or 
smaller as a standard action three times per day. This ability functions
 as a <i>polymorph</i> spell (caster level 15th), except that the dragon
 does not regain hit points for changing form and can only assume the 
form of an animal or humanoid. He can remain in its animal or humanoid 
form until he chooses to assume a new one or return to his natural form.
 </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b>
 Nymmurh can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents 
he can't actually see still have total concealment against him.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Keen Senses (Ex):</b> Nymmurh sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Water Breathing (Ex):</b> Nymmurh can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/8/8/8/7/7/7/5; save DC 17 + spell level): 0 -- <i>dancing lights, detect magic, disrupt undead, ghost sound, mage hand, mending, open/close, prestidigitation, read magic;</i> 1st -- <i>disguise self, forcewave</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>know protections</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>mage armor, true strike; </i>2nd -- <i>cat's grace, detect thoughts, invisibility, life bolt</i> (<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>magic mouth;</i> 3rd -- <i>analyze portal</i> (FRCS), <i>dispel magic, fireball, hold person;</i> 4th -- <i>charm monster, greater invisibility, scrying, summon monster IV; </i>5th -- <i>Grimwald's graymantle</i> (FRCS), <i>jumpgout</i> (see below), <i>Lutzaen's frequent jaunt </i>(<i>Magic of Faerûn</i>), <i>teleport;</i> 6th -- <i>acid fog, gate seal</i> (FRCS), <i>greater dispel magic; </i>7th -- <i>greater scrying, power word blind. </i></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Wyrm Who Watches keeps his interesting, useful, and powerful 
scrying-link spells secret indeed, but Volo learned something of his 
lesser magic (spells he passed on to various Silmerhelves, down the 
years), and one of these follows. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Jumpgout<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evocation</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Components:</b> V</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Duration:</b> 2 rounds</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Area:</b> 5 ft. diameter pillar of flame, up to 30 ft. tall</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half (see text)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 create a vertical pillar of roaring flame 5 feet in diameter and up to 
30 feet tall. Creatures caught in the fire take 1d6 points of fire 
damage per caster level (Reflex half), to a maximum of 15d6. On your 
next turn (the second round of the spell) the pillar vanishes and 
reappears 1d6x10 feet away from its original location. If you maintain 
concentration on the spell until the time it makes this "jump," you may 
restrict the possible direction to a quarter-circle of your choice, 
otherwise its new location is in a random direction. Creatures caught in
 the area of the fire on the second round take 1d6 points of fire damage
 per 2 caster levels (Reflex half), to a maximum of 7d6. The pillar then
 dies away in a swirl of sparks.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If cast underwater, <i>jumpgout</i>
 makes a swirling seam of boiling water that deals half damage (Reflex 
one-quarter) and remains in the same location both rounds.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Nymmurh's Fate</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nymmurh
 is likely to continue through the decades much as he is today, until a 
powerful and merciless dragon or mage (more probably, a cabal of mages, 
such as wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood or Cult of the Dragon) learn 
of his existence and launch a concerted attack. Nymmurh could well fall 
before he could muster defenses enough to stay alive.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He
 would also suffer acute distress, personal danger -- and at the least, 
an upheaval of his tidy lifestyle -- if a truly evil and ambitious 
Silmerhelve arose and kept his or her intentions hidden until a 
successful attack upon, or manipulation of, Nymmurh could be 
accomplished. No such Silmerhelve seems likely to develop in the current
 generation, and the bronze dragon has dealt with overly ambitious 
Silmerhelves in the past by manipulating their kin to unmask their true 
natures and to deal with them. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nymmurh
 could also die of old age or fall in a chance encounter with a younger 
and more vigorous dragon. He also just might finally feel the urge to 
father heirs of his own and begin the dangerous hunt for a suitable 
bronze dragon mate. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Interestingly,
 Saerista has (completely on her own) begun to search for the 
whereabouts of other bronze dragons, employing old maps, lorebooks, and a
 magical mind-scrying crown (all found among the vast mounds of 
accumulated oddities in the Pit). Is she reading Nymmurh's mind or 
responding to wistful things he's said? Does her plot involve changing 
herself into a dragon? Conceiving the offspring would be impossible 
without magical aid, and probably deadly to her in any event, but she 
might not know that or perhaps chooses to deny it. Nymmurh can't have 
failed to notice her studies, but so far he's pretended not to notice. 
Volo, Elminster, and so of course we, too, can only wonder why. </span></p>
