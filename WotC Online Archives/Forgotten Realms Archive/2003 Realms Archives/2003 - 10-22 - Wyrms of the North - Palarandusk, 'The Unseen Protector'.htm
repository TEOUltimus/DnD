<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<table border="0" width="570" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nestled
 in a high, narrow valley between three of the westernmost peaks of the 
Sword Mountains, not far from the High Road southeast of Leilon, is 
Ieirithymbul, a little-known village of gnomes. The peaks are known 
locally as Mount Stemhelm (the tallest, to the north), Mount Ardabad (on
 the east), and Mount Pheldaer (to the west). The valley and the stream 
that flows through it (only to vanish into a sinkhole, Braeder's Pit, a 
few miles to the south) are both known as Felrenden. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Folk
 in Leilon know the names of the peaks and that there are gnomes 
"somewhere in the mountains, and it's not wise to make trouble with 
them," but most of them couldn't tell you whether Felrenden is the name 
of their king, their realm, or just the gnome trading band that, save in
 the depths of winter, comes into Leilon about once a month. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ardabad,
 Braeder, and Pheldaer were all heroes of the Ieirithyn gnomes in their 
days, but the formerly energetic and aggressive gnome presence in the 
Sword Mountains has declined to what one village elder called "a 
shameful, sleepy shadow." Despite the rich Felrenden iron and copper 
lodes, and a huge seam of coal near the Pit, it's likely that this 
mining village (that can today muster, at most, some 400 adult gnomes) 
might long ago have vanished altogether under the fangs and blades of 
passing predators or rival miners had it not been for its "Unseen 
Protector." </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Few
 folk except the savage Forgebar dwarves (a 60- or 70-strong family of 
aggressive and well-armed hill dwarves who swiftly slay those who 
disagree with them and dwell in caves cut into the slopes of Mount 
Galardrym, a little more than ten miles east of Felrenden) know or 
suspect that the Unseen Protector of Ieirithymbul is a dragon. Most 
minstrels and sages believe it's a local guardian spirit. Some cleave to
 the alternative view that the Protector is the invisible "send-forth" 
of a gnome wizard who's learned how to travel out of his body in a 
flying, ghostlike form that can hear, see, speak, and cast spells. All 
of them ridicule any suggestion that the invisible spellcaster that 
routs anyone foolish enough to attack Ieirithymbul openly has anything 
to do with dragons.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Forgebar dwarves know better. Thrice their attacks on Ieirithymbul have
 led to the near-extermination of the dwarves involved, under the spells
 and rending claws of a fierce gold dragon whose scales are cracked and 
pale with age, and who weeps when he must slay -- but slays nonetheless,
 without hesitation or mercy. Volo recorded this as a clever disguise or
 magical image assumed by a spellcaster desiring to keep foes at a 
distance, but Elminster confirmed Palarandusk's true nature.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 spends almost all of his time these days as a soundlessly levitating, 
semisolid, invisible entity who can watch, listen, speak, and move 
about, but who cannot launch physical or magical attacks in this form. 
In like manner, the invisible Palarandusk retains the spells, movement 
rate, hit points, and strength of his solid form -- that of a male gold 
great wyrm whose eyes are bright and alert, but whose jaws are white 
with age, and whose scales are pale and cracked from long use and 
failing vitality. The Unseen Protector regards the gnomes of his chosen 
village as his children. He spends most of his time drifting along, 
watching over them. He's attracted to family quarrels, feasts, and other
 occasions when the normally taciturn gnomes speak freely and at length 
about their views, feelings, or aims, but otherwise tends to escort 
gnomes who are on the borders of Felrenden (sheep-herding, gathering 
edible meadow flowers, prospecting, or mining) or traveling out of the 
valley to trade. He's swift to act when an Ieirithyn gnome is 
threatened, but he is wise enough to value eavesdropping on enemy 
councils above making a show of materializing to strike first at 
arriving danger, or retaliating swiftly against a foe of the gnomes. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk's
 unique nature leaves him neither desiring nor needing much food; he 
absorbs moisture (and allows wastes to wash away, as desired) when rains
 fall or by lying in the icy waters of the Felrenden, and he devours 
mountain rock, mine tailings, or foes of the Ieirithyn when -- a rare 
thing -- hunger seizes him. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Orc
 raids, the misbehavior of visiting adventurers, and monster maraudings 
along the Coast Road near Leilon make Palarandusk act. Although he 
primarily defends the Felrenden, he does watch over Ieirithyn trading 
parties on their way to Leilon or trademoots along the High Road. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Unseen Protector is wary of adventurers hunting rare dragon trophies or
 unusual body remnants that can be sold to spellcasters and alchemists, 
so he is loathe to appear or otherwise reveal his presence unless he 
deems it necessary. A few wizards know of his existence and have come to
 Ieirithymbul to trade spells. Unless they bring magic that can make him
 live on in strength and power, however, Palarandusk is uninterested in 
long discussions. One spellcaster from Neverwinter did provide him with a
 spell that successfully drained a magical rod to empower Palarandusk's 
activities, but the dragon completely drained the item long ago; unless 
visitors bring him fresh magical rods of particular sorts, he can make 
no further use of that magic. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 never wastes time arguing with or warning intruders; he lurks and 
watches until action is necessary -- and then materializes and strikes. 
The Unseen Protector wields spells far beyond the norm for ancient gold 
dragons and is seldom seen by humans, few of whom will readily discern 
(or believe) what he has become. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 truly ancient gold he-dragon (mature when Netheril was young), 
Palarandusk has prolonged his existence beyond the natural death and 
decay of his body through powerful magic of his own devising. Now the 
spells that maintain his magically-knit form are failing, and he dares 
materialize for only a few minutes each day -- usually showing himself 
for only a few seconds, to proffer something, snatch something, or 
attack. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 rest of the time, Palarandusk exists as an invisible entity whose 
"attacks" against any victim cause brief nausea but incur no actual harm
 -- except to the Protector himself, whose semisolid form suffers damage
 from this interaction. In his invisible, semisolid form, Palarandusk 
does not age, the spells that keep him whole do not deteriorate, and he 
suffers no harm from the elements. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 solid form, Palarandusk has all the powers and properties of a gold 
great wyrm. He employs many spells forgotten today (learned mainly from 
the tomes of spellcasters who died in the fall of Netheril and the years
 of strife and confusion that followed). Palarandusk chafes in his 
"shadow existence" and dreams of becoming a widely respected power in 
the Sword Coast North once more.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Sun Dragon </span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 is first mentioned in a nameless, fragmentary book whose pages are 
burnished sheets of electrum stamped with characters unintelligible to 
the sages of today without benefits of magic to divine their meanings. 
In the days before Netheril was founded, Palarandusk dwelt somewhere 
along the Sword Coast and hunted such prey as wyverns from what is now 
Luskan to where Waterdeep was later founded. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Enslaved
 -- or forced into servitude to avoid a worse fate -- by the sorcerer 
Mileirigath in the early days of Netheril, Palarandusk spent centuries 
toiling in obedient obscurity, his longevity and eventually his nature 
and abilities altered by many spells cast on him by his master and 
Mileirigath's apprentices. When that realm of increasingly decadent 
splendor fell, he seized what magic (spellbooks in particular) he could 
from the ruins and the clutches of plundering illithids and other fell 
foes, and set about using his augmented magical abilities in freedom for
 the first time. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 has also collected philosophical human writings and has spoken with a 
few elves and dwarves about their own views of the world, with the aim 
of forming a personal code. He has collected some monetary treasures, 
which he hid in several high, remote mountain caves and rifts for his 
own later use. Sleeping on a bed of treasure and continuously coveting 
more wealth has no allure for Palarandusk, but he does enjoy beauty, 
such as that captured in the occasional statue or even painting, which 
might be found propped up in clefts and beneath sheltered overhangs here
 and there around the Felrenden today. He sees the value of coinage as 
rare and precious things for bargaining with humans, elves, and dwarves,
 or even purchasing magic or aid outright. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 lives by his own laws, which he alters rarely, and then only after much
 internal debate and reflection. He believes that any dragon has a duty 
to live in harmony with the land, devouring prey only as needful, 
despoiling things only when ruination can't be avoided, and protecting 
its domain against damage from such things as floods, fires, and 
invasions. In Neverwinter, the exploits of Palarandusk (under the name 
of the "Sun Dragon") are legendary; he protected the city several times 
from orc hordes and invasions from the northern Moonshaes, and he was 
seen as the benevolent protector of the city -- a heroic icon to whom 
some humans even prayed. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 passing years robbed the Sun Dragon of his strength and suppleness, and
 young dragons arrived to challenge him for his domain with the 
frequency of vultures circling a stricken beast. With no fitting, 
trusted successor as defender of Neverwinter in sight, Palarandusk dared
 not stand his ground and go down fighting, for that proud gesture would
 leave his chosen home undefended. He had to hide and devote his time to
 learning enough magic to survive -- and learning it fast. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Therefore
 the Sun Dragon was seen less and less in Neverwinter. He had already 
slipped into legend by the time the Arcane Brotherhood arose in Luskan, 
and fear of their recognizing his magical nature and using spells to 
enslave him drove Palarandusk to "disappear." </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Adopting
 human form, Palarandusk used some of his treasure to purchase a 
half-ruined mansion in the countryside not far south and east of 
Neverwinter, shut himself up in it, and set to work learning all the 
arcane spells he could. He was still there, decades later, when a band 
of adventurers who were either extremely fortunate in their choice of 
spells, or who'd been sent to destroy him by someone who knew his true 
nature, blasted the house to flaming embers around his ears. The attack 
came without warning, and it destroyed almost all of the aging gold 
dragon's spellbooks. Palarandusk escaped destruction by frantic use of 
his spells -- but not before his body had been so ravaged by magic that 
it was held together only by a web-work of shattered magical power. 
Whelming all of his magic to save himself, the Sun Dragon rebuilt his 
own frame, forming the substanceless body of the slowly crumbling Unseen
 Protector he is today. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 then decided that his lessened abilities made him unfit for his 
self-assigned post of defender of Neverwinter. The city in which he was 
now more of a shining legend than a memory now boasted half a dozen 
wizards of accomplishment and several resident bands of adventurers; it 
had decidedly less need for a draconic protector. Yet the gold wyrm was a
 restless wanderer as he toured much of the Sword Coast North, finding 
old friends and foes gone, and the land much changed from the untouched 
wilderlands of his youth. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At
 length Palarandusk decided his unease was because protecting the folk 
and the land of some small corner of Faerûn was now part of his nature; 
he could not be content except as a guardian. His sense of whimsy and 
gentle good nature grew with this realization, as he searched for a new 
"small corner" to call his own. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He
 wanted to live somewhere close to a center of vibrant activity, yet in a
 locale remote and unknown. He wanted to protect essentially honest folk
 given more to hard work and living with the land than, say, perfecting 
sorcery and dreaming of ruling other places. Human spellcasters were 
out, and the gnomes of Ieirithymbul -- almost unknown and yet relatively
 close to bustling Waterdeep -- were in. Palarandusk used magic to draw 
several gnome elders out on their own, one after another, to reveal 
himself to them, offering to defend them if they'd accept his presence. 
One by one, awed and touched, they agreed, and the long career of the 
Unseen Protector of Ieirithymbul began. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Down
 the years since, the body of the aging gold dragon has continued to 
deteriorate, despite several magical augmentations Palarandusk purchased
 or traded other spells for. He destroyed one orc horde before it could 
properly form, frustrating the plans of the cunning orc chieftain 
Rauragh, whose prize scheme was to bring orc bands through the 
subterranean ways of the Underdark to assemble in the Sword Mountains, 
and from there swoop down on Waterdeep, moving by night until the walls 
could be stormed by surprise. He has also slain several human wizards 
(including Radiglar "the Worm-tamer" of the Cult of the Dragon) and 
shattered an adventuring band, Koroaver's Raiders, who sought to 
establish a mining stronghold that could ally itself with the Zhentarim 
and give the Dark Network a defensible trading base on the doorstep of 
Waterdeep. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Already
 an expert in the flows and consequences of magic, able to predict with 
fair accuracy the result of two or even more spells clashing on the same
 target or in the same space, the Unseen Protector has recently learned a
 surprising amount about current trade alliances and practices along the
 High Road, whilst lurking undetected in Leilon or on the route the 
gnomes use between there and Felrenden. He's always alert for news of 
doings elsewhere in the North that might warn him of orc hordes, 
displaced war survivors, or migrating monsters possibly soon to be seen 
in the Sword Mountains. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 spends his days in diligent guardianship and contemplating ways in 
which his body can be magically strengthened. He avoids other dragons 
whenever possible, and the noted draconic expert Velsaert of Baldur's 
Gate is unaware of Palarandusk, although he has recorded several 
"unconfirmed rumors with a shared subject: invisible wyrm melting into 
visibility and attacking" in the vicinity of Leilon. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 key to Palarandusk's character is his light humor and thorough and 
sympathetic understanding of human nature, operating through a firm 
personal code. If paladins learned about him, they could learn much from
 him. He defends the Ieirithyn gnomes like a bold and benevolent 
grandfather, never thinking of his own safety, never employing traps or 
ruses, and never sleeping. In fact, he has no need to sleep, though 
Elminster believes that the hastening deterioration of the dragon's body
 is directly related to Palarandusk's ceaseless activity; other wyrms of
 advanced age seem to spend almost all of their time asleep.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Palarandusk's Lair</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Unseen Protector has no true lair. He keeps things of beauty in several
 remote clefts and overhangs (for their own protection against the 
elements, not security) around and about Felrenden, and he has treasure 
stashed (usually under boulders he placed there) in various rock clefts 
in the Sword Mountains and in the southernmost Crags, north of 
Neverwinter. He has no need of personal warmth or shelter and finds the 
idea of prepared traps abhorrent. Snatching up mountainside boulders to 
hurl down at a foe during battle is fine, because there's no 
premeditation in such deeds unless the boulders have been deliberately 
collected and placed there beforehand.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Palarandusk's Domain </span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Unseen Protector rarely leaves Felrenden and a narrow strip of 
territory linking it to Leilon along the High Road but considers that he
 has every right to go where he chooses, given the urge or necessity. 
Other dragons may have their domains and defend them fiercely, but he 
was here before them all, and (he thinks) will probably outlive most of 
them. He has no desire to offend a wyrm whose domain he's traversing, 
but if attacked, he'll defend himself -- and unless the dragon is of 
good alignment (and thus, merely misguided), the Protector will seek to 
slay or maim his attacker. Over-aggressive wyrms give all dragons a bad 
name, endangering all dragonkind . . . and so should be eliminated. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Palarandusk </span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 spends a typical day drifting from one gnome to another like an anxious
 but silent invisible sheepdog, trying to maintain an overall, ongoing 
picture of the whereabouts and doings of all the Ieirithyn gnomes. At 
the same time, he tries to watch out for creatures of all sorts 
approaching the Felrenden. Given the prevalence of spellcasters able to 
magically transform themselves these days, even lone birds can't be 
ignored. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Palarandusk
 is not known to have ever mated (though his early days are a mystery to
 historians and might well have included pairings), and he isn't known 
to particularly welcome the presence or friendship of other dragons. He 
worked amicably with other wyrms while in service, in Netheril, but 
seems never to have sought out other wyrms. A true and contented loner, 
the Unseen Protector maintains no current alliances.</span></p>

 When Palarandusk is in his semi-incorporeal form and attacks a creature
 with a bite, claw, or other natural attack, the target creature takes 
no damage but is nauseated for 1 round (creatures immune to critical 
hits are immune to this attack). This attack is harmful to the dragon as
 well, and he is affected in the same way as if he had squeezed himself 
through a space too small for his Colossal body (4d4 hit points of 
damage, maximum hit points are reduced by 1).</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Semi-Incorporeal Form (Su):</b>
 The dragon can assume an invisible and semisolid form (or change from 
this form to his normal, solid form) as a standard action. This form is 
less solid than a material creature but more material than an 
incorporeal one; attacks against him are treated as if he is an 
incorporeal creature except the incorporeal miss chance is only 25% 
instead of 50%. While in this form he cannot make physical attacks on 
material creatures (but see Spectral Touch, below), nor can he carry 
objects or creatures unless he had swallowed them while in his normal 
form (in which case they transform when he does). While semi-incorporeal
 he cannot use his breath weapons or cast spells on other objects or 
creatures, but can still use spells and spell-like abilities that affect
 only him. He may interact with incorporeal creatures or ghost touch 
items as if he were incorporeal. His natural armor bonus becomes a 
deflection bonus and he has no Strength score. Because he is not truly 
incorporeal, he cannot pass through solid objects, though he can squeeze
 through spaces small enough to keep out a Colossal creature but not a 
Gargantuan one; doing so deals 4d4 hit points of damage to the dragon 
(incorporeal miss chance does not apply), and his maximum hit points are
 permanently reduced by 1 point. </span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Elminster
 gleaned details of only one of the Unseen Protector's spells -- a 
battle magic that Palarandusk uses sparingly, deeming it "unfair" to use
 it when he faces only a single foe, but useful in defending gnomes from
 one foe whilst he's occupied with others.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Whipstrike<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Evocation [Air]</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level:</b> Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 3</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Components:</b> V, S</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) </span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Target:</b> One creature</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous </span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial (see text)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 spell creates a whirlwind of solid air, akin to certain of the magic 
effects that hold Palarandusk together. It forms above a chosen target 
and stabs down in a single, unerring strike, hammering the victim for 
1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). A 
creature that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw takes only half 
damage.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 Medium or smaller target who is on the ground that fails its save is 
knocked prone by the blast of air. If the target is flying, it is blown 
downward (1d6 x 5 ft. if Medium, 1d6 x 10 ft. if Small, or 2d6 x 10 ft. 
if Tiny or smaller, and Tiny or smaller creatures suffer 2d6 points of 
nonlethal damage from battering and buffeting in addition to the spell's
 primary damage). Large or larger creatures cannot be knocked prone or 
moved by this spell.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This spell has no effect if cast underwater.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Palarandusk's Fate</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 the Unseen Protector could well be overwhelmed if the Felrenden ever 
became vitally important to the Arcane Brotherhood, another cabal of 
evil mages, or any alliance of three or more dragons, it seems more 
likely he'll soldier on in obscurity for several more centuries before 
his body finally falls apart. Whether his magic will enable him to 
continue on as a disembodied sentience or not is unknown -- but 
Elminster warns that, if it does, the Protector (deprived of any means 
of defending anything, and fated only to watch) could well go insane and
 might then pose either a menace to all . . . or be merely a powerless, 
unseen shadow.</span></p>
