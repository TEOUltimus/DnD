<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">On
 a grassy bank overlooking the long road north of Amphail stands 
Rundreth Manor, once home to the warrior-adventurer Galath Rundreth 
(whose bones lie somewhere in the wood that used to be its back garden).
 A succession of rougher owners followed Rundreth, and most of them used
 the many-pillared house as little more than a cave to shelter in 
between raids or hunting expeditions. These included the Brothers 
Skladdar (who grew wilder than the beasts they trapped, and whose skins 
they wore) and Emvorele the Gentle Blade (an elven coach robber as 
skilled as she was small; she stood 4 feet tall in battle-boots and 
swung a sword the size of a fire-skewer).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">About
 twenty years ago, most of the manor's roof fell in, and a battle 
between rival adventuring bands both seeking to camp in what was left of
 the once-grand stone mansion caused two of its pillars to topple, 
crushing three men beneath their bulk and gaining Rundreth Manor a 
reputation for being haunted. Inevitably, folk of Amphail and passing 
merchants saw the ghosts of the dead adventurers watching them from the 
ruins.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 truth was probably less poetic. Outlaws have done a little howling and a
 little melting noiselessly away into concealment and have been dubbed 
"ghosts" before. Yet everyone seems to agree that the Dark Lady who 
haunts Rundreth Manor now is something different -- something that 
brings death to many handsome young men, sending others away alive but 
changed. The survivors return with a faraway look in their eyes and doom
 riding their shoulders like a dark, tattered cloak that curls and 
switches of its own volition.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">It's
 certain the young male adventurers lured to Rundreth believe they're in
 the company of someone very much alive -- and that the fearful few who 
come equipped to slay a vampire find no such foe and are persuaded to 
set aside their weapons by a friendly lady. Some who've seen this Dark 
Lady say she's small of stature, catlike in her grace, and clad in too 
little to conceal any weapon. And yet man after man of the young 
warriors who enter Rundreth is found dead -- torn apart as if by great 
jaws and tossed out onto the road, piece by piece, for flies and 
passersby to find.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">If
 we can believe the ballad of the minstrel Inder Braelen (who returned 
to the Manor several times before disappearing there four winters ago), 
the Lady brings men to the ruined house by the score for purposes of 
seduction -- or to rob and slay them. She usually kills such paramours 
but lets the occasional one go. Those who spread word of what happened 
to them, such as Inder, soon disappear. Those who hold their peace and 
remain friendly to the Dark Lady are suffered to live. Inder claimed 
that some of these men remain her willing servants lifelong, obviously 
still fostering a love for her.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Inder's
 ballad lays bare two secrets of the Lady: Her habits, love of 
concealment, and the illusion magics she wields conceal her true nature 
from all save those who become her intimates -- that she is a drow. 
Inder saw something more. The Dark Lady was more than a dark elf, or 
else a drow who could shapechange at will.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Certain
 Harpers -- one lover of the Dark Lady among them -- know rather more 
about the deadly lady of Rundreth Manor, and between what Volo learned 
from them and what he'd overheard at a Mage Fair (before his writings 
made him widely unpopular among mages), he pieced together the truth 
about the Dark Lady -- facts Elminster has confirmed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Her
 name is Nurvureem, and she is a drow . . . and more. In fact, she's a 
drow song dragon, a drow who can change to a shadow dragon at will. A 
few veteran Harpers call her "the Drow Dragon."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Her
 origins are unknown even to her, but some Harpers have speculated that 
Nurvureem may be the last surviving offspring of an isolated drow 
enclave who were enslaved by shadow dragons in the remote northeastern 
Sword Coast North over a thousand years ago, and after many centuries 
broke free of their servitude by mastering enough magic. It must be 
emphasized that this "origin" is pure speculation. Nurvureem has more 
than once revealed that she's been alone and wandering for as long as 
she can remember, with no memory of parents or even a time when she was 
young. She does recall a time when she hated sunlight and lurked in 
caves that come to the surface somewhere near Triboar, exploring the 
surface world in tentative forays that occurred only in fog, stormgloom,
 or the darkness of night.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Nurvureem
 shuns the company of other drow and worships no deity, drow or 
otherwise. Only human, half-elven, and elven mages customarily impress 
her; she treats such individuals with gentle care until she's taken her 
measure of their power and decided whether she should seduce them, 
remain hidden, seize items and spellbooks while they sleep -- or simply 
attack.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 Dark Lady's seductions seem designed to win longtime friends and 
perhaps a mate. Friends who later prove to be weaklings or who turn 
against her become coerced allies, fearful servants, or -- most often 
--swiftly dead at her hands. Only Nurvureem knows what she truly seeks 
and whether she can come to trust any other being. From her deeds and 
words passed on by men she has entertained in ruined Rundreth, we know 
that Nurvureem is lonely, probably less than sane, and unrepentantly 
evil. She openly delights in theft and cruel pranks such as misdirecting
 caravans over cliffs. On at least three occasions she has tricked 
wizards into attacking the isolated homes of other mages, then tried to 
slay both wizards while they dueled, or to steal what magic she could 
during the fray. She exults in slaughter and in viewing the destruction 
wrought by others, yet she can also be tender and vulnerable, seeking 
both affection and protection. On one occasion, she offered her throat 
to a wary Harper, drew his own dagger and put it into his hand, bidding 
him strike if he thought it best. The Harper found he could not bring 
himself to slay her. He insists that she had placed herself, tilting her
 head back over one of his arms and wrapping his cloak around and around
 her own arms to thoroughly bind them out of the way, vulnerable to a 
killing stroke had he delivered one. Her submission might have been a 
clever gamble, but it wasn't a trick -- no change to dragon form or 
sudden movement could have saved her. Many Harpers who heard the tale 
consider it clear evidence of her insanity; a few others are more 
charitable in their views.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">All
 accounts agree that, whenever attacked in earnest, Nurvureem changes to
 shadow dragon form, though she can use her spell-like draconic powers 
when in drow shape and when (as a drow) she's maintaining a humanoid 
semblance through the use of illusion.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">First
 mentioned in travelers' journals circa 1304 DR, Nurvureem initially 
roamed a fairly small area of the North, ranging east and southeast from
 Triboar as far as the High Forest (never going north or west). In 
recent decades, she has known to have followed the trade routes as far 
south as Baldur's Gate, lingering near Daggerford, and up the Delimbiyr 
as far as Secomber. She stayed in the Bargewright Inn for two seasons, 
wreaking such havoc that local Harpers persuaded a drow priestess of 
Eilistraee to join them in ousting her. At their first confrontation, 
Nurvureem screamed in rage and fled, lurking in the wildlands for almost
 a year.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 mage who one night conjured the illusion of a drow warband to drive 
away Nurvureem reported that she was "visibly upset" by the sight, even 
though she evidently knew it to be only an image and not a real group of
 dark elves. The Drow Dragon seems to avoid cities, large caravan camps,
 and anywhere that is home to noise, bustling activity, and lots of 
folk. On at least two occasions, she has taken rural employment as a 
"shroud-spinner," preparing the bodies of the dead for burial, so as to 
gain a ready supply of carrion to dine upon. She has employed a variety 
of outward appearances and aliases, but she always dwells alone. To all 
outward appearances, Nurvureem is a very talented seamstress who seems 
able to see and function perfectly in the dark. When in this guise, she 
is always prepared for attacks; her cottages have alarm-warning traps, 
such as balanced buckets of old metal scrap and tripwires, set ready 
against intrusion.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">When
 in dragon form, Nurvureem is believed to be in all respects an adult 
shadow dragon. She can employ her draconic ability to converse with any 
intelligent creature, as well as the spells she gains as a shadow 
dragon, while she's in any form.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 Drow Dragon has no one true lair but maintains several hideaways and 
magic caches across the North. One is a tumbledown cottage in the hills 
east of Red Larch surrounded by monster skeletons to deter casual 
explorations; another is a dry gulch (large enough to hold a shadow 
dragon lying flat, and hiding healing potions under tumbled boulders at 
its heart) in the gently rolling hills west of the High Forest and east 
of Beliard. A third is known to be a cave high in a mountainside or 
rocky height somewhere near the area Nurvureem is known to roam -- but 
just which pinnacle, Volo was unable to learn.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Nurvureem's Lair</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">To
 Nurvureem, lairs seem little more than places to hide from prying eyes 
and keep a little magic hidden for emergencies. Once, sorely wounded, 
she was observed to "hop" from lair to lair, quaffing healing potions at
 each until she was strong enough to resume her business: spying on 
those who'd harmed her, and plotting their imminent doom, which she 
subsequently brought about. Rockfall traps (employing delicately 
balanced and wedged boulders that will crush someone approaching a 
potion cache from the easiest or obvious direction, but which do nothing
 if someone gets at the potions by another way -- usually a way that 
involves some climbing or crawling) are in some of these hideaways, but 
in general the Drow Dragon's lairs are simple shelters, not fortresses 
studded with spells or other perils and manned by servitor creatures.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Nurvureem
 uses ruined Rundreth Manor purely as a place to which to lure young 
human male adventurers, maintaining a hidden cache of wine, clothing, 
and food there, but little more. If she suspects a man is going to 
betray her straightaway by summoning adventurers or Waterdhavian patrols
 to attack her, she often gives him a gift she keeps hidden somewhere in
 the ruins: the magic sword <i>Blazhserblane</i> (a <i>+1 jumping long sword</i> (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?WTC11964">Magic of Faerûn</a></i></span><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"> for the <i>jumping</i> weapon property) that dates to the time of the Fallen Kingdom; it can glow with <i>faerie fire</i>
 when grasped and commanded, and bears a permanent tracer spell linked 
with a gem that Nurvureem possesses, allowing her to follow the 
movements and know the approximate whereabouts of anyone bearing it -- 
and clearly hear all words they speak, regardless of distance.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Nurvureem's Domain</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Nurvureem
 knows every ravine and nameless creek from Triboar to Calling Horns. 
Her roaming takes her along the verges of the High Forest to Secomber, 
thence along the edge of the High Moor and the Misty Forest to the Way 
Inn, and back northward through Daggerford to skirt Waterdeep and 
Goldenfields, taking in all else to the edges of the Kryptgarden Forest,
 and thence to Triboar once more. This is more a "stomping ground" than a
 patrolled and defended domain.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Velsaert
 of Baldur's Gate calls her "That deadliest of dragons -- the sort who 
evades battle and all the other outward show of draconic life, to lie 
low when other wyrms roam or seek to do battle . . . only to rise up 
when unexpected and strike out of the shadows like a merciless snake." 
Rotting dragonflesh is Nurvureem's favorite food, and she gets it by 
slaying adventurer- or weather-weakened dragons and plundering their 
hoards for all the magic she can find, use, or trade, before dining on 
her prey. Nurvureem has slain all the dragons to whom she has known to 
have revealed her true nature. Her victims include Oskalymm the Old, a 
black dragon who once laired somewhere in the northern High Moor; 
Andrathanach, a young green dragon who was trying to establish a lair on
 the western border of the High Forest south of Noanar's Hold; and 
Surpuryte, daughter of Iiurrendeem, a silver dragon who dwelt in Amphail
 more or less permanently in human form.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Deeds of Nurvureem</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Nurvureem
 has been alone and wandering the Sword Coast North for at least seven 
decades. She seems to like drow form, scouting lands by night, lazing in
 caves or swimming holes by day -- and hunting in dragon form at 
twilight when she's found prey to her liking, or assuming dragon form 
whenever she encounters trouble. The Drow Dragon often sports with prey,
 chasing and toying with them for some time before slaying. Dead victims
 are often transported to rocky heights to become properly ripe for her 
liking -- places she can watch from adjacent rock pinnacles, swooping 
down to kill carrion-eaters drawn to the remains.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">After
 dragons (and their kin, wyverns), humans are the favorite prey of the 
Drow Dragon. Magic-wielding humans are of the most value to her because 
of their knowledge and the items they might carry -- but their flesh 
tastes no better than that of humans who know spells only through 
folktales. Nurvureem hates other drow and is both fascinated by and 
fearful of other sorts of elves. Elves who treat her with arrogance 
never fail to enrage her, but Nurvureem has tasted too many traps to let
 her feelings goad her into instant attack before she has examined her 
surroundings and considered the situation. Most plots to slay or capture
 her amuse her more than anything else, and she seems to view the 
strivings of adventurers as personal entertainments provided for her by 
Faerûn. She often spies on adventuring bands she sights in the 
wilderlands, seeking only to enjoy "the show" (and dining on whatever 
they slay, once it is suitably rotten).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Nurvureem
 can be alarmed -- into seething anger -- if she discovers plots against
 her involving other dragons. She despises dracoliches and the Cult of 
the Dragon. She destroys Cult members and bone dragons alike when they 
cross her path, though she doesn't bother pursuing them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Nurvureem
 uses the men who leave Rundreth Manor devoted to her to bring her back 
magic items, potions, and spell scrolls -- and to keep her informed of 
adventurers and Cult agents active in her domain. Occasionally she'll 
visit one of her "Faithful Few" unannounced, appearing across their fire
 at night, or in their bedchamber at an inn or home. She doesn't do this
 just when she wants something or to check up on them -- often she 
desires a little companionship more than anything else, and to catch up 
on news. One of her men was trembling with fear as he revealed his 
recent marriage and baby child, only to have her glowingly congratulate 
him and go fetch some treasure as a gift for the babe. On several 
occasions she's helped her Faithful by "standing in" as a wife or 
escort.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Nurvureem's breath weapon is a 40-foot cone of billowing, smoky shadows
 with an energy drain effect. Each creature within the cone gains three 
negative levels. A successful Reflex save (DC 22) halves the number of 
levels lost (rounded down). This same DC is used for the Fortitude save 
to overcome the negative levels 24 hours later.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex): </b>Nurvureem
 can unsettle foes with her mere presence in dragon form. The ability 
takes effect automatically whenever she attacks, charges, or flies 
overhead. Each creature within a radius of 180 feet that has less than 
19 HD is subject to the effect. A potentially affected creature that 
succeeds at a Will save (DC 25) remains immune to Nurvureem's frightful 
presence for one day. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD 
becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds, and one with 5 or more HD becomes 
shaken for 4d6 rounds. A panicked creature takes a -2 morale penalty on 
saving throws and must flee. A shaken creature takes a -2 morale penalty
 on attack rolls, checks, and saving throws. Nurvureem ignores the 
frightful presence of other dragons.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>mirror image</i>; 2/day -- <i>dimension door</i> (DC 20 [object]). Caster level 6th.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b>
 Nurvureem can freely use an ability much like polymorph self to assume 
human form. Each has a unique human form that she assumes each time she 
changes shape (Nurvureem's "human" form is that of a female drow). When 
she changes form, her Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores 
become average for her new form (Str 10, Dex 12, Con 8), but her hit 
points are unaffected by this change. Nurvureem can employ her dragon 
spells and special abilities -- except her breath weapon -- in either 
form. Changing from dragon to drow form requires 2 rounds; reversing the
 change takes only 1 round. During this time, she cannot move and can 
use only her spells or breath weapon (if changing from dragon to drow, 
otherwise the breath weapon is unavailable). Other actions and attacks 
are impossible. The change rends all known bonds, clothing, and other 
confinements, without harm to Nurvureem.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Blindsense (Ex):</b>
 Nurvureem can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. 
Opponents she can't actually see still have total concealment against 
her.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Shadow Blend (Su):</b>
 During any conditions other than full daylight, Nurvureem can disappear
 into the shadows, giving her nine-tenths concealment. Artificial 
illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate 
this ability. A daylight spell, however, will.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Tongues (Su):</b> Nurvureem can communicate in any language through the use of an innate <i>tongues</i> ability that is always active.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>True Seeing (Su):</b> Nurvureem has true seeing (as the spell) to a range of 15 feet. This ability is always active.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/8/7/4; save DC 16 + spell level): 0 -- <i>dancing lights, detect magic, ghost sound, light, mage hand, open/close, ray of frost;</i> 1st -- <i>charm person, disguise self, hold portal, shadowgloom; </i>2nd -- <i>cat's grace, darkness;</i> 3rd -- <i>threesteel.</i></span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Nurvureem's Fate</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 Drow Dragon is heading for a confrontation with massed adventuring 
bands, whether she knows it or not. Several adventurers who have escaped
 her clutches at Rundreth Manor have continued to work for Nurvureem but
 have told adventuring companions about her. There seems to be a general
 mood among rulers and adventurers in the Sword Coast North that Faerûn 
would be better off without her, and that it is fast becoming time to 
strike Nurvureem down regardless of the price in blood she might exact. 
The warrior Angrathos "Swordshatterer" of Neverwinter even tried to 
enlist the assistance of Claugiyliamatar, an ambitious green dragon, in a
 hunt to corner and destroy the Drow Dragon, but the Dragon of 
Kryptgarden Forest refused.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Word
 of a connection between the Dark Lady of Rundreth Manor and the "drow 
who can turn into a dragon" is spreading fast thanks to several 
minstrels, but this is a recent notion, not generally-agreed-upon fact 
(even among Harpers and those learned or at least interested in the 
affairs of dragons).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">A
 noose seems to be slowly tightening around Nurvureem. She seems almost 
to savagely welcome it, though whether she's seeking release through her
 own death or just a glorious fight remains a mystery . . . perhaps even
 in the clouded mind of the Dark Lady herself.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Nurvureem's Magic</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 Drow Dragon commands only a few sorcerer spells but has acquired a 
useful collection of wands and other battleworthy magic items -- 
including a ring that can teleport her away from real peril, another 
ring that can create many illusions, and plentiful magic healing. Two 
spells she is known to use follow.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Shadowgloom<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Illusion (Shadow)</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 1</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Components:</b> V</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Effect:</b> 10 ft. radius of gloom or one shadowy form of Large or smaller</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (see text)</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">You call upon the power of shadow to create one of two effects:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Gloomcloud:</i>
 You create a cloud of gloom that fills a 10-foot radius. Any creatures 
within the gloom are protected from the effects of full sunlight and do 
not suffer penalties for light blindness or light sensitivity from 
sunlight. Spells that create light (including <i>daylight, searing light, </i>and<i> sunbeam</i>)
 work normally within the area; the gloom protects only against actual 
light or sunlight originating from outside the area of gloom. Attacks 
made inside or into or the area suffer a 10% miss chance due to the 
gloomy conditions (creatures with darkvision and low-light vision ignore
 this miss chance).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">With
 this variant you may also cause one creature or object of up to Medium 
size to be obscured by shadows. An affected object gains total 
concealment in the darkness, and becomes invisible while the effect 
lasts. A creature is merely disguised by deep shadow that completely 
obscures the major features of its bodies. The creature remains visible,
 but its identity and possibly even its race cannot be deduced just by 
looking at the creature. The disguised creature can still see, and the 
enveloping shadows do not adversely affect its ability to perform any 
action. Saving throws and spell resistance applies to a creature that 
does not want himself or an object in his possession to be affected in 
this manner. Normally this aspect of the spell is used to disguise a 
creature or hide an object from scrutiny (including something like 
concealing a door).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Quickshadow:</i>
 You create a roughly humanoid shadow (shaped as you choose, so it may 
resemble a human, a satyr, or a winged creature) of size Large or 
smaller. The shadow immediately moves 60 feet per round in the direction
 you indicate until it reaches the maximum range, at which point it 
fades away. The shadow is harmless and cannot cause harm. It cannot move
 into a space unless the spell has line of effect to that space. (For 
example, it could not pass through a closed door into the room beyond, 
but could move through a portcullis with ease.) This aspect of the spell
 is normally used to deceive viewers into thinking a message or summoned
 creature is fleeing or charging them. Of course, since you choose its 
shape you may use it as a prearranged signal to someone (a halfling 
shadow meaning one message, a harpy shadow meaning another, and so on).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Threesteel<br></span></b></span><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Transmutation</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 3</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Components:</b> V</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Range:</b> Touch</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Target:</b> One weapon of up to Large size (greatsword, shortspear, and so on) in your possession</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates (object)</span><br><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">You
 split the target weapon into three exact duplicates of the original 
weapon. These duplicates immediately launch themselves at a target or 
targets of your choice within Close range (you may direct one or more of
 the weapons at the same target or split them up among three different 
targets). Make a ranged attack roll for each weapon (using your ranged 
attack bonus or the ranged attack bonus of a fighter of your caster 
level, whichever is higher) as if you were proficient in using the 
weapon in the normal manner. (For example, if used on a greatsword you 
would make a ranged attack roll as if you were proficient in greatsword,
 without the normal penalty for using an improvised throwing weapon.) 
The weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage if it does 
not have one already.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Each duplicate that hits deals damage as if you had struck the target with the weapon (including any special effects such as <i>bane</i>, <i>smite evil</i>,
 critical hits, sneak attacks, Weapon Focus, and so on). Your Strength 
bonus does not apply, since the force of the weapon comes from the 
spell, not your own Strength. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a
 combatant get one.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Casting
 the spell destroys the targeted weapon to create the duplicates, and 
the duplicates are destroyed whether or not they hit. Because of this, 
the spell is rarely used on magic weapons, though it is far more 
effective with weapons which have greater magic. It cannot be cast on 
artifacts, natural weapons, weapons animated with <i>animate objects</i> or similar spells, or weaponlike magic creations (such as <i>Mordenkainen's sword</i>).</span></p>
