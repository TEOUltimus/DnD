<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2012-08%20-%20All%20Adrift%20on%20the%20Dune%20Sea%20%28Part%202%29%20-%20Not%20Exactly%20a%20Thorn%20in%20His%20Paw_files/RE_Dec03_2cd2.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="221" width="261">The
 androsphinx Calibmennon has become alarmed by the plague of monstrous 
scorpions in the Dune Sea. He has spent the past several days trying to 
locate and eliminate their nests. Earlier today, Calibmennon found a 
Colossal monstrous scorpion, and perhaps it's the one that spawned the 
entire current plague of scorpions now swarming over the Dune Sea. 
Calibmennon tried to defeat the scorpion from a distance using his 
spells, but they proved insufficient for the job. The androsphinx had 
better luck with flyby attacks, but the scorpion grabbed him and stung 
him several times before finally succumbing to Calibmennon's claws. 
Calibmennon has been stung three times. Thanks to a <i>delay poison</i> 
spell, Calibmennon hasn't yet attempted any saving throws against the 
venom, but once the spell wears off, he'll have to make three Fortitude 
saves at DC 23. The poison could kill him outright by reducing his 
Constitution score to 0 or less, but even one failed save could kill him
 thanks to his current, low hit point total.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs find Calibmennon near the body of his foe. After
 defeating the scorpion, Calibmennon circled the body in ever expanding 
rings. He was trying to discover the den or nest from which it came. He 
has not been successful, so he has returned to the site of the battle 
and crouched down next to the body to take a breather. Thanks to the 
dunes, the PC can't see Calibmennon and his kill from very far away, but
 the vultures circling overhead can be seen from a great distance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs arrive on the scene, Calibmennon does his 
best to remain calm and polite, but he'll eventually get around to 
asking the PCs for a <i>neutralize poison</i> spell or, failing that, treatment from a character with the Heal skill. A single <i>neutralize poison</i>
 spell will fix up Calibmennon. To treat the three stings with the Heal 
skill, a character would have to make six checks (once for the initial 
save for each sting, and once more for each secondary save). The DC for 
success is 23; if the PC is treating the poison, it's possible that 
Calibmennon will make a successful saving throw anyway (see the Heal 
skill description in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Calibmennon has used most of his spells today, but not 
his roar (he knows his roaring has little effect on mindless vermin). 
Should the PCs attack (or even threaten to attack), Calibmennon looses a
 roar and goes down fighting. He's not quite himself right now, and he 
figures he has little to lose. If the PCs press the issue, he agrees to 
pay for treatment and offers 3,000 gp and a potion (DM's choice) for a 
cure. He doesn't have the cash or the potion with him (he has them 
stashed in his lair). If the PCs fail to treat Calibmennon, they won't 
get paid. If they succeed, however, Calibmennon agrees to bring the 
payment right back here in three days time. The sphinx is in no mood to 
negotiate, and if the PCs want payment, they'll have to take the deal. 
Calibmennon won't break his word, though he's not happy about having to 
pay.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Should the PCs offer to help Calibmennon without 
demanding any payment, the androsphinx promises to do them a favor 
someday. He reveals the location of his lair and tells them to drop by 
if they need anything.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Should the PCs kill Calibmennon, or just let him die, 
they'll meet a pair of gynosphinxes later in the day. The two ladies 
have been scouring the desert seeking Calibmennon. They are very unhappy
 to find him dead, and they want to question the PCs at length to find 
out if they know anything about his death. The gynosphinxes have a 
pretty decent chance of detecting any evasions or lies the PCs tell 
them, thanks to their Sense Motive scores. Should the gynosphinxes 
conclude the PCs had anything to do the Calibmennon's death, they 
pretend to be satisfied, but they actually withdraw to a safe distance 
and use their <i>symbol</i> abilities. Each wears a medallion that can bear a symbol. One sphinx places a <i>symbol of death</i> on her medallion, and the other uses a <i>symbol of pain.</i>
 They both set their symbols to be triggered when viewed, and they 
attune the symbols to each other, so that they both are immune to each 
symbol's effects (see the <i>symbol</i> spell description in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).
 Then they return to attack the PCs. They first swoop low to trigger 
their symbols. Then they move in for melee attacks. They flee if reduced
 to 20 hit points or less.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs helped Calibmennon, they still meet the 
gynosphinxes, but they're in a much better mood and are mainly 
interested in learning Calibmennon's whereabouts, which the PCs can 
provide if the androsphinx gave them the location of his lair. Should 
the PCs do so, the gynosphinxes warn them that there is a flock of 
hieracosphinxes hunting in the area.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Calibmennon (androsphinx):</b> hp 114 (currently 28). Use the stats from page 232 in the <i>Monster Manual</i>, except that Calibmennon has only the following spells remaining:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cleric Spells remaining (save DC 13 + spell level):</b> 0 -- <i>guidance, light;</i> 1st -- <i>protection from evil*;</i> 2nd -- s<i>hield other*;</i> 3rd -- none. </p>
<p align="LEFT">*Domain spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gynosphinxes (2):</b> hp 52 each (see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 233).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs mention that they defeated the monstrous 
scorpions from "A Plague of Scorpions," Calibmennon would like to hear 
the details. In any case, he urges the PCs to leave the area quickly 
since it is literally crawling with monstrous scorpions. During his 
flights across the countryside, he has seen a set of newly uncovered 
ruins (detailed in "Mummies by Moonlight") and an encampment of nomads 
(detailed in "A Taste of Desert Hospitality"). If he is on good terms 
the party, he relates what he knows about these two encounters, which 
isn't very much.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Calibmennon knows that the ruins have been uncovered for
 only a few days, and they likely will be covered up again soon. He 
doesn't know what the ruins contain, but he suspects that it has served 
as a bandit hideout from time to time, which means there may be some 
treasure hidden there.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Calibmennon tells the PCs that the nomads are friendly, 
but a bit of an oddity in these parts. Calibmennon spoke to them 
briefly, and they told him they were crossing the Dune Sea in search of 
better grazing for their goats. Calibmennon hopes they have a quick 
passage across the Dune Sea, because there certainly aren't any good 
grazing areas to be found anywhere within the Dune Sea.</p>
