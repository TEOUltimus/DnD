<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>The Corner Case</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2004-12%20-%20The%20Hamlet%20of%20Relmouth%20%28Part%203%29%20-%20The%20Corner%20Case_files/mummy_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="324" width="247">The
 large structure on the corner is home to a human woman named Lyrie. If 
Relmouth could be said to have a heart, it belongs to Lyrie, the most 
sympathetic woman the hardened quarry workers had seen. A painting of 
her would show a fairly average human woman, but her sweet disposition 
overshadowed her physical appearance to make her more beautiful than 
anyone in the area.</p>
<p align="left">She loved one man: her husband Luthor. The two of them 
had shared their lives for many years before they decided to invest in 
the quarry and then run a support business that utilized their skills at
 baking, gardening, weaving, tailoring, and pottery. When the quarry 
stopped, though, so did their chances of making enough money to retire 
and enjoy life. </p>
<p align="left">The couple was not content to let their futures ebb, and
 despite the danger of the winged horror that was set loose, they 
investigated the tomb thoroughly. They soon discovered a secret door 
that led to a new chamber filled with preservative spices and magic -- 
and instructions for their use. The numerous items had enough value that
 the couple could sell them and afford to relocate again and chase a new
 dream.</p>
<p align="left">The fates would have none of it. Luthor died a few days 
after the discovery of the secret chamber. Lyrie's grief tore her heart 
apart. Pain wracked her mind and she did something that only a day 
before she would never have considered: She preserved her husband's body
 using what she'd found in the secret chamber.</p>
<p align="left">Those left in the hamlet knew of Luthor's death, but she
 concealed what she'd done after his death and worked to hide the secret
 chamber again. She encouraged those in Relmouth to ignore her situation
 and concentrate on their own affairs. Given the things going on around 
them, the inhabitants of Relmouth have more to worry about than Lyrie's 
dead husband.</p>
<p align="left">Luthor woke some time later as a mummy. His mind was 
diminished by the mummification process but he still holds some things 
dear, notably the safety and protection of his wife, Lyrie. To that end,
 he'll protect her and his house at any cost, without regard for 
personal safety.</p>
<p align="left">However, Luthor is drawn to the secret chamber, though 
he doesn't know why. In fact, as a mummy, Luthor yearns to rest, and 
he's drawn to the chamber because it's the closest thing to a tomb that 
he has. Since the secret chamber isn't his tomb, Luthor finds no rest 
there, and his desire to protect and support his wife eventually 
emphasizes his restlessness. As for Lyrie, she thought Luthor's 
transformation process might have imparted some knowledge of the chamber
 and perhaps another secret chamber. It doesn't seem to be a case. When 
Luthor returns to the chamber, he does nothing but close the secret door
 leading into it, then stand inside the chamber patiently. After some 
period of hours, Luthor exits the chamber and returns home, there to 
spend a seemingly random amount of time before returning to the chamber.</p>
<p align="left">If Lyrie is called upon during the day, there is as much
 chance as not that Luthor will also be there. Luthor tends to remain 
out of sight because of Lyrie's reactions if he heads toward daylight or
 toward someone else from Relmouth. Although not mystically compelled to
 remain close to Lyrie, his house, or the quarry, he nevertheless 
refuses to go anywhere else (unless Lyrie is threatened) and seems 
willing to follow Lyrie's desires. Luthor cannot speak to Lyrie, but he 
understands enough of Lyrie to figure out what she wants. He can 
determine that she prefers that he not show himself to visitors, for 
example. If Lyrie's voice becomes stressed, Luthor won't hesitate to 
come to her aid, regardless of circumstances.</p>
<p align="left">How much time is spent in either location is random 
enough that Luthor could be encountered at the corner house or at the 
quarry. What will summon Luthor to the scene (if he's nearby) is 
anything that upsets Lyrie. Lyrie is a very secretive person and as such
 doesn't respond well to being questioned. If anyone becomes too brash 
with any interrogation of her, Luthor comes as quickly as his shambling,
 bandaged legs will carry him.</p>
<p align="left">The depth of Lyrie's despair over her husband's death 
followed by his reanimation has made her immune to Luthor's despair 
supernatural ability. She is not, however, immune to his mummy rot, 
though nothing would convince Luthor to strike Lyrie.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lyrie's Current Motives</b></p>
<p align="left">Lyrie continues to attempt to find more chambers in the 
tomb. Not only does she seek more methods of bringing Luthor back to his
 former self, but she also seeks wealth. With money comes an answer to 
her situation from other avenues of exploration, she hopes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Luthor (mummy):</b> hp 65; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 190.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="left">The Stranger and Gunther both know about Luthor since 
they've seen him shambling from his house to the quarry and back many a 
time. They both avoid him because they feel it's more profitable to 
ignore him than to tend to him. The danger comes when PCs interact with 
Luthor, an event that would lead to Lyrie and her knowledge of a new 
secret chamber. This alone would encourage more exploration in the 
quarry -- and perhaps releases more horrors into Relmouth.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Coming in Part 4 of the Hamlet of Relmouth</b></p>
<p align="left">The area around Relmouth is home to many creatures 
common to all forests -- and to something that's definitely not. It's 
alive, has intelligence, and is coming to town.</p>
