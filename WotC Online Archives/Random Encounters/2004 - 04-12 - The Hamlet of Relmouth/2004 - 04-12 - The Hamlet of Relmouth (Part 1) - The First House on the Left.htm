<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>The First House on the Left </b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2004-12%20-%20The%20Hamlet%20of%20Relmouth%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20The%20First%20House%20on%20the%20Left_files/dnd_aprilre1.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="191" width="191">The
 squat, misshapen house that is the first on the left as you come into 
town is set a bit apart from the others near it. The hut is owned by 
Meril, a simple man with one preoccupation: torture. He particularly 
enjoys torturing people, but he often has to settle on animals from the 
nearby woods since few people visit Relmouth these days.</p>
<p align="left">Meril thought he would live his life as a stoneworker. 
The cliffs near where Relmouth stands today were thought to be a 
wonderful source of marble, and so he came to town and envisioned a rich
 life of tearing marble out of the earth by day and mercilessly 
torturing people at night.</p>
<p align="left">In fact, the first year of work was exactly as Meril had
 hoped for. People came to town, buildings started going up, and he had 
plenty of victims to choose from. He built himself a small house on the 
edge of town with the help of others, though it never looked like much. 
As for those who took part in his night-time hobby, he always took great
 care to pick out the ones whom other workers thought were a bit flaky. 
As Meril and his co-workers knew, people sometimes find that they're not
 cut out for quarry work. It takes both strength and endurance to claw 
and scratch at rock walls for days on end and few have that stamina. As a
 result the workers saw frequent walk-offs when the quarry was 
operating, so it's not surprising that people disappeared from Relmouth.
 As a result, both those working the quarry and those living in the 
hamlet came to expect a certain number of people to walk off the job in a
 given week. This suited Meril's needs perfectly.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately for him, Meril's way of life changed about
 a year after the quarry first started. The workers uncovered something 
long forgotten and buried: the entrance to a tomb. Runes carved on the 
stone plug of the tomb were prominent but their meaning was unknown. 
Instead of finding the runes' meaning, the workers thought only of the 
riches that waited within. Using their stone-moving tools, they made 
short work of the plug and crowded into the passage beyond.</p>
<p align="left">Meril had been late to that party. He had spent the day 
getting supplies for the quarry workers and was returning with the wagon
 when he saw the commotion around the tomb entrance. He arrived in time 
to hear shouts for rope and more tools. They had found something: a 
statue of a fierce, winged beast and in its clutches was a bright yellow
 gem as big as a baby's head. They figured it was worth 10,000 gold 
pieces if it was worth one, though none among them could say for sure 
what type of gemstone it was. It didn't matter -- they were all rich.</p>
<p align="left">Meril took one look at the gem and rushed out of the 
tomb. He figured his fellow workers were certain to quarrel and soon 
kill each other over it -- he had seen it happen before. So Meril set to
 work on a plan to steal the gem and hide it in the woods. He left the 
chamber with a hasty excuse and fetched his tools. When he got the gem, 
he must have a place to keep it safe and, more importantly, hidden from 
everyone else.</p>
<p align="left">The man was by no means an experienced wilderness hiker,
 but to Meril's credit, his mind focused exclusively on the task of 
preparing an area in the woods for the one object that he knew would 
change his life forever. Unusual insight led him to an ideal place to 
dig a pit between the quarry and the hamlet and make a rudimentary but 
effective trap over it. It would surely kill the first person who found 
it by accident and the trap itself would help hide the gem from view.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spiked Pit Trap:</b> CR 3; mechanical; location 
trigger; manual reset; Reflex save (DC 14) avoids; 10 ft. deep (1d6, 
fall); pit spikes (Atk +10 melee, 3d6 damage); Search (DC 15); Disable 
Device (DC 30). <i>Market Price:</i> 5,700 gp.</p>
<p align="left">The plan for how to steal it was forming in his mind 
when he spread out the last handful of leaves and heard the first 
excited shouts from the quarry. Rushing to the scene, he found his 
companions had broken the hand clutching the gem from the rest of the 
statue. Meril figured that given the time that had passed, it must have 
been a particularly difficult task. He silently thanked his comrades for
 going to the trouble for him.</p>
<p align="left">The setting sun cast a long shadow over the tomb's 
entrance so that the statue's hand slowly emerged from darkness into the
 rich red light of a dying day. "Lemur," so called because of the way he
 could practically cavort up and over obstacles like a monkey, was the 
one who had the honor to bring it out of the dark confines of the tomb. 
The gem captured the light and reflected it around the area, bathing the
 group in a radiant, sparkling red. It was a beautiful sight that gave 
everyone pause, even Meril, as he stopped just at the edge of the woods 
and stood staring at the incredible glow.</p>
<p align="left">The sun striking the gem was the trigger the ancient, 
ignored, runes had warned of. Filled with natural sunlight, the magic 
that had created the gem was activated, releasing the spirit imprisoned 
within.</p>
<p align="left">A blob of light poured from the gem and pooled on the 
ground. From this pool rose a fearsome creature. It stood as tall as a 
human male, had great wings, and had two horns proudly jutting from its 
forehead before they swept back.</p>
<p align="left">Its eyes spoke its intention. They were scarlet and 
freakishly bloodshot from multiple hues of red converging. The creature 
laughed. The quarry workers could not respond, each one afraid of what 
could happen if the creature's mood shifted suddenly. They didn't have 
to wait. It set upon them with a fierceness that surprised even Meril. 
It killed two before everyone had a chance to scatter. It killed more 
(several gnomes and a halfling) by taking flight and swooping over them,
 carrying them into the air only to drop them to their screaming deaths.
 </p>
<p align="left">Despite the carnage, Meril still focused on his prize. 
The gem had been discarded and lay in a pool of Lemur's blood. When the 
creature seemed distracted, he ran over and grabbed the gem, and then he
 ran to the woods as fast as he could. He didn't need to hide the gem 
any more -- anyone who cared was going to die before the sun set, he 
figured. Instead he made his way to the next nearest town.</p>
<p align="left">Alas, no one has heard from him.</p>
<p align="left">Since then, the quarry no longer produces marble and 
people have stopped coming to Relmouth. In fact, those who have stayed 
behind have not so much left but have started disappearing . . . and 
people hear odd things from Meril's home these days. Some say his spirit
 haunts the hut, but others believe that the one that killed the workers
 at the quarry has made this empty house its erstwhile home. (Most of 
those who number among the latter have packed up and left town already, 
though DMs can keep one person around to assist PCs in any 
investigation.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Meril's Current Motives</b></p>
<p align="left">Meril left the area that fateful day when the gargoyle 
was released, but he has since returned the richer after his sale of the
 gemstone he had taken. After the stone's magic was used, it became a 
prized golden sapphire, though of a size and quality that allowed Meril 
to gain enough money to live quite comfortably for years. His goals now 
are to find more treasure in the tomb and to perhaps spend a few more 
hours enjoying his hobby. He avoids the gargoyle at all costs, but he 
hasn't yet figured out that Nerilk is lurking up in the small attic of 
his own house.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nerilk:</b> Male gargoyle fighter 1/wizard 1; CR 6;

<p align="left"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="left">Anyone visiting Relmouth can come across Nerilk after 
his first appearance. Nerilk has no intention of leaving Relmouth. The 
gargoyle believes that other chambers exist within the quarry and, 
perhaps, other gargoyles he knows. Perhaps if he waits patiently for the
 quarry to start back up, someone will uncover more chambers. All the 
gargoyle needs to do is sit quietly and wait patiently -- something 
gargoyles are particularly apt at. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Coming in Part 2 of the Hamlet of Relmouth</b></p>
<p align="left">A visitor to Relmouth loved the place enough to stay. Of
 course, he didn't buy a house or plant a farm. Instead, he wants to 
harvest other visitors....</p>
