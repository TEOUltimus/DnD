<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>The Harvest of Souls</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>The clerics stood in the perimeter of the stone 
circle, looking at the man tied to the oaken wheel in the center. The 
man, a leather tanner from a village some fifty miles away, had just 
passed out from fright, and now he hung limply on the huge wheel. The 
oak wheel sat in the center of a summoning circle that had seen use by 
generations of the cult's followers. The cult worshiped now one demon 
lord, now another, but the basic functions of worship remained the same 
no matter the demon lord involved: sacrifice weaker humans by calling 
demons to rip their souls from their bodies. As the chanting began anew,
 the victim awoke in time to feel a wrenching in his soul as a foul . . .
 thing . . . took form before him.</i></p>
<p align="left">Deep in the wilderness, a cult of demon worshipers 
founded a stone circle in which to practice their horrific rites. These 
rites always included summoning demons and bribing them with the souls 
of mortals. The stone circle was about 40 feet in radius and marked by 
stone blocks that weighed 20 tons each. They were intricately carved in 
Abyssal with names and prayers to various demons. As the power balance 
in the Abyss changed, so did the demon to whom the cult paid homage. 
Prayers written on the stones were never erased, and they became a kind 
of historical record of the practices of the cult. The stones also were 
imbued with magical power and served as the marker for a permanent 
summoning circle. The center of this area held a huge wheel made of oak,
 on which victims would be strapped. The cult originally used an altar, 
but one of the demon lords communicated that it preferred the victims to
 be upright. The wheel was surrounded by a magic circle that trapped the
 summoned demons. Thus, if the cult merely wanted to gift their master, 
they could summon a demon that could take the victim's soul and then 
depart when the summoning spell ended. The cult members would remain 
relatively safe.</p>
<p align="left">These practices went on for centuries, since they were 
far from civilization and their predation on the surrounding towns was 
sparse enough that no one really caught on to the real reason for people
 occasionally disappearing. These ongoing practices caused a lasting 
evil effect in the area (see page 35 of the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>).
 Also centuries of using magic that opened a gate to the Abyss 
eventually weakened the fabric of reality there. The cult members 
noticed that they could summon demons far more easily and began to plan 
attacks on the nearby civilizations. Any summoning or calling spells 
with the evil designator cast here are more powerful. The spell's caster
 level increases by +2; this bonus also applies to any level check the 
caster must make to overcome the subject's spell resistance (if any). In
 addition, any saving throw or check the summoned creature makes to 
avoid the spell or resist following the caster's orders suffers a -2 
penalty.</p>
<p align="left">However, the cultists never realized their ambition. A 
paladin of Heironeous tracked one of the cult's victims back to the 
stone circle and brought a small army to deal with these vile people 
once and for all. The members were slaughtered while crying to their 
demonic masters, and the demons never responded. The cultists' bodies 
were left to the animals after being blessed, and they eventually rotted
 away or were consumed. The paladin and his army pulled down most of the
 stones and broke them apart and scattered the pieces. Only a few were 
left standing, and these were defaced with holy symbols. The great wheel
 was burned and its ashes buried. Rejoicing, the good people left the 
area. Within two generations it was forgotten. Time and the elements 
wore down the standing stones so that the writing was barely visible. 
The magic circle broke and eventually wore away. The bones of the 
cultists lay scattered among the wilds near the site.</p>
<p align="left">Recently, the site has become the center of an even more
 horrific activity. The repeated spells weakened reality, or planar 
boundaries, in that place, and created a close link to a place within 
the Abyss. Demons could peer through the boundary and see the area, but 
they could not cross over by themselves. So, they required a little 
help.</p>
<p align="left">A group of adventurers camped in the center of the old 
site, right where the great wheel used to stand. During the night, 
demons prowled on their side, and one of them tried to reach the one on 
guard. It was rewarded with the soul of the poor adventurer. When the 
others awoke, more demons reached through, and one of the demons 
discovered that it could move into the empty body. Soon the four 
adventurers had demons in their bodies, and their souls were given to 
more powerful demons.</p>
<p align="left">Up to six times a day, the demons can create an effect similar to the <i>trap the soul</i>
 spell, cast at 20th level. If a victim fails his save against the 
effect, his soul leaves his body and goes to the Abyss, where it exists 
as a visible, but disembodied spirit. It is the same size as the 
original creature. It is incorporeal, but visible, and has no attack 
abilities, hit points, or ability scores. It cannot be damaged if 
attacked. It flits aimlessly about.</p>
<p align="left">Unlike a regular <i>trap the soul</i> spell, the 
victim's body remains behind as a mindless automaton. So long as a 
soulless body remains in range of the spell, a demon can occupy the 
body. The effect is similar to a <i>magic jar</i> spell, except that the
 soulless body gets no save. The demon occupying the body retains its 
own supernatural and spell-like abilities, its base attack bonus and 
base saving throws, which are modified by the new bodies' physical 
ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The demon 
retains its own mentality and mental ability scores (Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma), and its own Hit Dice (though the body's 
Constitution score determines its hit points). The demon has the 
physical qualities of stolen body; these include natural size, mundane 
movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, 
and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 
feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such
 as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, 
and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number 
of extremities, and so forth). They cannot depart the body except at the
 ritual site, where the demon can return to the Abyss. The demon can 
also return physically to the Abyss via magical means. If killed while 
within the stolen body, the demon dies.</p>
<p align="left">The demons began a cult of their own and began 
attracting people to the site (or kidnapping them). People brought to 
the site had their souls taken, and demons occupied their bodies. The 
cult grew. Now it seeks to replace persons of importance in nearby towns
 and cities with demons occupying their bodies, so that the demons can 
consolidate their power on the mortal world and feed their hunger for 
souls.</p>
<p align="left">Souls can be rescued and returned to their bodies, but 
only at great effort. The soul must be found in the Abyss (as a 
disembodied spirit) and brought back to the place in the Abyss that 
joins with the ritual site. Then a <i>limited wish</i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>miracle</i> spell is needed to reunite the two parts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Coming in Part 4 of Demons </b></p>
<p align="left">Breeding fiends with ordinary creatures is always a 
cause for ruin, and this is especially true when the creations become 
their own species of evil. </p>
