<p class="size2"><b>Trial of the Burning Tigers</b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2012-09%20-%20Monks%20of%20the%20Burning%20Tiger%20%28Part%205%29%20-%20Trial%20of%20the%20Burning%20Tigers_files/re_monks_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="244" width="191">The monks of the Burning Tiger Monastery are trained in the deadly arts of martial combat. Within the walls of their <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/re/re20021111a">isolated fortress</a>,
 they fight each other to establish who is the strongest of all. The 
final test for any aspiring candidate is a fierce battle against a large
 number of the monastery's students, followed by combat against the 
school's leader, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/re/re20021118a">Magoun</a>. Combatants that dare defile the monastery by entering without permission are also subjected to this test. </p>
<p class="size2">The test is divided up into several different trials, 
all of which take place in the monastery's training ground area. The 
entire contest is watched over by 10 monks armed with heavy crossbows on
 the courtyard catwalks, ordered to shoot any candidate the tries to 
flee or refuses to fight. The encounter is designed with monks in mind 
and other classes might suffer a serious disadvantage. </p>
<p class="size2">The monks of the burning tiger use the stats below. See the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for information on their special abilities:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="530"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size2"><b>Burning Tiger Monk:</b> Male or female human Mnk 1; 
CR 1; Medium-size humanoid; HD 1d8+1; hp 9; Init +5; Spd 30 ft.; AC 13, 
touch 13, flat-footed 12; Atk +2 melee (1d6+2, unarmed strike), or +2 
melee (1d6+2, kama), or +2 melee (1d6+2, nunchaku), or +2 melee (1d6+2, 
siangham), or +1 ranged (1d10/19-20, heavy crossbow); SA flurry of 
blows, stunning attack 1/day; SQ evasion, fast movement; AL LE; SV Fort 
+3, Ref +3, Will +4; Str 14, Dex 13, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 8.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Skills and Feats: </i>Balance +5, Hide +5, Jump +6, Swim +6, Tumble +5; Dodge, Improved Initiative.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Flurry of Blows:</b> The Burning Tiger monk can use 
the full attack action to make one extra attack per round with an 
unarmed strike or a special monk weapon at his or her highest base 
attack, but this attack and each other attack made that round suffer a 
-2 penalty apiece. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it affects 
attacks of opportunity the monk might make before his or her next 
action. If armed with a kama, nunchaku, or siangham, the monk makes the 
extra attack either with that weapon or unarmed.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Stunning Attack (Su):</b> Once per round (but not 
more than once per day), the Burning Tiger monk can stun a creature 
damaged by his or her unarmed attacks. The foe so struck must make a 
Fortitude saving throw (DC 12) or be stunned for 1 round in addition to 
taking normal damage from the attack. Creatures immune to critical hits 
cannot be stunned with this attack.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>If a Burning Tiger monk makes a 
successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals 
half damage on a successful save, he or she instead takes no damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i> Any one of the following weapons: kama, nunchaku, siangham, or heavy crossbow (and 10 bolts).</p>
<p class="size2">The trials are described below:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trial of the Pit</b></p>
<p class="size2">The first trial takes place in a large pit (20 feet in 
diameter and 10 feet deep) in the center of the training ground. The 
candidate must stand inside the pit, alone, armed with whatever weapons 
she chooses. A monk, armed with a single weapon, drops into the pit 
every 1d6 rounds to fight the candidate. The trial ends when the 
candidate has been defeated or 10 monks have been defeated. If the 
candidate survives, she has 5 rounds to rest (and heal up) before the 
next trial begins.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trial of the Burning Arrows</b></p>
<p class="size2">The burning logs are removed and the candidate stands 
once again in the pit, armed with 10 javelins. Because of the depth of 
the pit, it is impossible to see anyone not standing within 5 feet of 
the edge. Roll the initiative for 10 separate monks. Once every round, a
 monk approaches the pit edge from a random direction and shoots at the 
candidate with flaming bolts from a heavy crossbow (+1d4 points of fire 
damage), before retreating. The trial is concluded when the candidate is
 dead, or has survived 10 rounds. The candidate can try to attack (with 
javelins) any monk that she sees, or jump up to strike them, but she 
cannot leave the pit. If the candidate survives, she has 5 rounds to 
rest (and heal up) before the next trial begins.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trial of the Burning Bridge</b></p>
<p class="size2">A wooden plank covered with oil is placed over the pit,
 which is filled with burning logs and embers. The candidate stands in 
the middle of the plank and must fight more monks. A monk, armed with a 
single weapon, is sent down either side of the bridge to fight the 
candidate. Each time a monk is defeated, another goes down the bridge to
 fight. </p>
<p class="size2">The fire beneath the bridge will ignite the oil after 
2d4 rounds, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage each round to everyone on 
the bridge. Once ignited, the bridge will collapse into the pit after it
 sustains 10 points of fire damage -- standing in the burning pit deals 
an additional 1d6 points of damage per round. The trial concludes when 
the bridge collapses, although any survivors must get out on their own. 
If the candidate survives, she has 5 rounds to rest (and heal up) before
 the next trial begins.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trial of the Master</b></p>
<p class="size2">The final trial pits the candidate against the head of the monastery, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/re/re20021118a">Magoun</a>.
 The battle begins inside the pit, but the battle can move to any 
portion of the monastery. Magoun fights the candidate using the 
monastery's most treasured item, the<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/re/re20021202a">rod of the burning tiger</a></i>.
 The candidate is free to use any and all methods to defeat Magoun, 
although she is still shot down if she tries to flee the compound. In 
trials against other Burning Tiger monks, the combat lasts until the 
candidate is defeated (Magoun does not try not to kill such a promising 
individual, but does not hesitate to do serious damage) or when Magoun 
is defeated or declares the contest concluded.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trial's End</b></p>
<p class="size2">If a monk of the monastery survives the trials, she is 
then considered one of the elite of the school and treated accordingly. 
If the survivor was an enemy, then the monks grudgingly accept her as a 
worthy opponent and allow her to leave the monastery unmolested. 
However, if she kills Magoun in combat, the remaining monks attack en 
masse, hoping to avenge their master's death.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">If the PCs ever do find themselves inside the 
monastery, it's very possible that each one will have to face the trial 
singly. This can spell the doom of those without martial skills given 
the nature of the trials, so DMs should be very wary about how they use 
trial series. It may be a good idea to have Magoun allow the PCs to 
choose one of their number to represent the group, but DMs should also 
set this up in such a way that the group doesn't get bored while 
awaiting the outcome. Perhaps another situation is occurring while the 
chosen PC is undergoing the trial. For example, a needed NPC with 
information is caught along with the group, which allows for roleplaying
 while the chosen PC under trial by burning tiger continues to face the 
martial challenge at hand. If you have a friend who wants to stop by for
 one gaming session, you could even set up this person as the NPC for 
the game so that one group can roleplay getting information out of the 
NPC while your martial challenger undergoes the trial! (You can also 
have the person play other roles besides informant.)</p>
