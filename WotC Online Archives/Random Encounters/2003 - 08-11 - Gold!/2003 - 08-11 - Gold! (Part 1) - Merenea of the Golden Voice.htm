 with a singing voice second to none, Merenea was directed throughout 
her youth toward the study of music. She enjoyed using the patterns of 
music, performing compositions, and even writing new songs, but her 
heart was pulling her in another direction. She did not understand where
 her true interests were until she became angry at a mentor and killed 
him. This experience revealed her true wish in life: to kill. She left 
her community to learn more about killing, and she fell in with an 
assassin who was more than happy to teach her his ways in exchange for 
some personal consideration. Thus, she learned that she could use her 
beauty and seductiveness to get what she wanted.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After
 a few years, she left the assassin to make her way in the world alone. 
She began performing in taverns and other public places to establish a 
reputation as a famous bard, and then began looking for clients who 
wanted someone out of the way. She uses her bardic "cover" to both 
mislead people as to her real activities and to get close to potential 
victims. She has, over the course of two years, developed a reputation 
as one of the finest singers in the land, as well as one who likes to 
party and "meet new people." Thus, she is usually spared having to sneak
 into a target's abode, since her skills at defeating defenses are not 
that great.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lately,
 she has hooked up with a human ne'er-do-well named Rassin, a jovial 
rogue who lives by his wits. Their relationship is somewhat complicated,
 though. They are not partners in crime, since their criminal interests 
lie in different directions. They both know that combining a theft and a
 murder on the same victim can be dangerous, and neither wants the other
 to be captured. Neither wants to be captured themselves either, if it 
comes to that. They are also casually intimate and share a real fondness
 for each other. It is hard to say whether this fondness is deep or 
lasting, since neither likes to become too tied to a place or a person. </span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Death Attack: </b>If
 Merenea makes a successful sneak attack against a target she has 
studied for 3 rounds, she can attempt to paralyze or kill her target 
(Fort DC 15 negates). </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b>
 Merenea may make a bardic knowledge check with a bonus of +9 to see 
whether she knows some relevant information about local notable people,

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bardic Music:</b> Merenea can use her song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around her. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Countersong (Su):</i>
 Merenea can counter magical effects that depend on sound by making a 
Perform check for each round of countersong. Any creature within 30 feet
 of her who is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack 
may use her Perform check result in place of his or her saving throw if 
desired. Countersong lasts for 10 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fascinate<i> (Su): </i>Merenea
 can cause up to three creatures within 90 feet that can see and hear 
her to become fascinated with her. Merenea's Perform check result is the
 DC for the opponent's Will save. Any obvious threat breaks the effect. 
Fascination lasts 8 rounds. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Competence (Su):</i>An
 ally within 30 feet who can see and hear Merenea gets a +2 competence 
bonus on skill checks with a particular skill for as long as he or she 
can hear the music. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i> Allies who can hear Merenea receive a +1 morale bonus to saves against <i>charm</i>
 and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage 
rolls The effect lasts for 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear 
her. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Suggestion<i> (Sp):</i> Merenea can make a <i>suggestion</i> (as the spell) to a creature she has already fascinated. A Will save with a DC of 17 negates the effect.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Elf Traits:</b> Merenea is immune to magic <i>sleep</i>
 spells and effects. She has a +2 racial bonus on saves against 
enchantment spells or effects, and a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, 
and Search checks (already figured into the statistics given above). She
 is entitled to a Search check when within 5 feet of a secret or 
concealed door as though actively looking for it. She has Martial Weapon
 Proficiency (composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, longsword,
 and rapier) as bonus feats.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Poison Use:</b> Merenea is trained in the use of poison and never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a blade.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>Merenea retains her Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker.</span></p>
