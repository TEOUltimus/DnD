<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Entomanothropy Runs Wild</b></p>
<p align="left"> Entomanothropes are humans or giants that can transform
 themselves into monstrous vermin. While similar to lycanthropes, they 
differ in the forms they can assume and some of their abilities. As a 
lycanthrope struggles against its animal nature, an entomanothrope 
remains at peace with its vermin nature because it has no alignment 
conflicts. Entomanothropes in humanoid (or giant) form resemble the 
humanoid or giant they are, but they have some verminlike 
characteristics that depend on the vermin type. Generally the vermin 
looks are reflected in the face, but reddish tough skin on the back and 
arms is not uncommon among werescorpions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creating an Entomanothrope</b></p>
<p align="left">"Entomanothrope" is a template that can be added to any 
humanoid or giant (referred to as the base creature). Entomanothropy as 
an affliction works exactly as the lycanthropy affliction does, except 
that the entomanothrope never runs the danger of assuming the alignment 
of the vermin type (as vermin really have no moral or ethical sense). 
Entomathropy can be cured in the same way as lycanthropy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Size and Type:</b> The base creature's type does not 
change, but the creature gains the shapechanger subtype. The 
entomanothrope takes on characteristics of some monstrous vermin (not 
swarms) no more than one size category larger than the base creature 
(referred to as the base vermin). Entomanothropes can also adopt a 
hybrid form that combines features of the base creature and the vermin. 
The hybrid form is the same size as the base creature's size. 
Entomanothropes can assume vermin forms one size smaller than the base 
creature size, regardless of the normal size of the vermin type. For 
example, an entomanothrope that is humanoid and Large monstrous scorpion
 could become a Small monstrous scorpion, though its hybrid form would 
be Medium and its normal vermin form would be Large.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hit Dice and Hit Points: </b>Same as the base 
creature plus the base vermin. To calculate total hit points, apply the 
best Constitution modifier that the creature has in any form. Hit points
 do not change when the entomanothrope changes form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Speed:</b> Same as the base creature or base vermin, 
depending on form. Hybrids use the base creature's base land speed. If 
the hybrid form has wings (see under Alternate Form below), then the 
hybrid has a fly speed equal to the lesser of the base creature's base 
speed or the base vermin's normal fly speed. For example, the giant wasp
 has a fly speed of 60 feet. If a human commoner entomanothrope (speed 
30 feet) changed into a hybrid giant wasp form, it would fly at speed 30
 feet. If an 11th-level human monk entomanothrope (base speed 70 feet) 
changed into a hybrid giant wasp, the hybrid would fly at 60 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Armor Class:</b> The base creature's natural armor 
bonus increases by +2 in all forms. In hybrid and vermin forms, the 
natural armor bonus is equal to the base vermin's or base creature's, 
whichever is greater.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Base Attack/Grapple:</b> Add the base attack bonus 
for the base vermin to the base attack bonus for the base creature. The 
lycanthrope's grapple bonus uses its attack bonus and modifiers for 
Strength and size depending on the lycanthrope's form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Attacks:</b> Same as the base creature or base 
vermin, depending on which form the entomanothrope is using. An 
entomanothrope in hybrid form uses the base creature's attacks and the 
base vermin's bite attack (or other primary natural weapon if the vermin
 form lacks a bite attack). Monstrous scorpion entomanothropes gain claw
 attacks in hybrid form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Damage: </b>Same as the base creature or base vermin,
 depending on which form the lycanthrope is in. Hybrid monstrous 
scorpions have claw attacks that do 1d4 base damage for Medium hybrids, 
1d6 base damage for Large hybrids, or 1d8 base damage for Huge hybrids.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Attacks: </b>An entomanothrope retains the 
special attacks of the base creature in humanoid form, and of the base 
vermin in vermin or hybrid form. It also gains the special attacks 
described below. Class abilities (such as sneak attack) are retained in 
all forms.</p>
<p align="left">An entomanothrope spellcaster cannot cast spells while 
in vermin form and cannot cast spells with verbal components in hybrid 
form. Monstrous scorpion entomanothropes cannot cast spells with somatic
 components in hybrid form.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Curse of Entomanothropy (Su)</i>: Any humanoid or 
giant of size Small to Huge that is hit by an entomanothrope's bite or 
sting attack in vermin or hybrid form must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude 
save or contract entomanothropy. The curse can be passed through claw 
attacks if the hybrid or vermin form does not have a bite or sting 
attack. Afflicted entomanothropes cannot pass on the curse of 
entomanothropy.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Poison (Ex)</i>: If the base vermin has a poison bite
 or sting, or an acid sting, then the entomanothrope gains these special
 attacks in its hybrid form. The type of poison (or acid) and the 
Fortitude save Difficulty Classes remain the same in hybrid or vermin 
form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Qualities:</b> An entomanothrope retains the 
special qualities of the base creature and base vermin (except vermin 
traits), and it also gains those described below.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Alternate Form (Su)</i>: An entomanothrope can assume the form of a single type of vermin as if using a <i>polymorph</i>
 spell on itself, though its gear is not affected, it can maintain the 
new form indefinitely, and it does not gain hit points for changing 
form. It adds the physical ability score modifiers to the scores of the 
base creature rather than gaining the base vermin's physical ability 
scores (see how to calculate these under "Abilities" below). </p>
<p align="left">An entomanothrope can also assume a bipedal hybrid form 
with two humanoid (or giant) arms and legs, and a face like the base 
vermin. The hybrid body is basically humanoid, but with fur or hair or 
skin/plates like that of the base vermin. Werescorpions have clawed 
hands. If the base vermin has a tail sting attack, then the hybrid form 
has it too. If the base vermin has wings, then the hybrid form has wings
 also. The fly speed is calculated as per the Speed section above. 
Changing forms is a standard action. (See Lycanthropy as an Affliction 
in the <i>Monster Manual</i> for information about afflicted entomanothropes controlling their change.)</p>
<p align="left"><i>Damage Reduction (Ex):</i> An entomanothrope in vermin or hybrid form has damage reduction 5/silver.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Darkvision (Ex):</i> Entomanothropes have darkvision to a range of 60 feet in any form.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Entomanothropic Command (Su):</i> In any form, entomanothropes can command vermin of its type (any size) as if using a <i>command undead</i>
 spell on mindless undead. This ability affects 2 Hit Dice of the vermin
 type per Hit Die of the entomanothrope, and it lasts for 1 hour.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Entomanothropic Immunities (Ex):</i><b></b>Entomanothropes
 have immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, 
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) in any form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Base Save Bonuses:</b> Add the base save bonuses of the base vermin to the base save bonuses of the base creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Abilities: </b>All entomanothropes gain +2 Wisdom and
 -2 Intelligence. In addition, when in vermin or hybrid form, the 
entomanothrope's physical ability scores equal the animal's normal 
ability scores -10 or -11 (subtract 10 from even scores and subtract 11 
from odd scores). For example, a werespider based on a large monstrous 
spider (Str 15, Dex 17, Con 12) adds +4 Str, +6 Dex, and +2 Con. An 
entomanothrope may also gain an ability score increase due to increased 
Hit Dice (from adding the template), but this increase cannot be put 
into Intelligence.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills:</b> An entomanothrope gains skill points 
equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die of its vermin form, 
as if it had multiclassed into the vermin type. (Vermin is never its 
first Hit Die, though, and it does not gain quadruple skill points for 
any vermin Hit Die.) Any skill given in the vermin's description is a 
class skill for the entomanothrope's vermin levels. In any form, an 
entomanothrope also has any racial skill bonuses of the base creature 
and of the base vermin, although conditional skill bonuses apply only in
 the associated form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Feats:</b> Add the base vermin's feats (if any) to 
the base creature's. If this results in a entomanothrope having the same
 feat twice, the entomanothrope gains no additional benefit unless the 
feat normally can be taken more once, in which case the duplicated feat 
works as noted in the feat description.</p>
<p align="left">This process may give the entomanothrope more feats than
 a character of its total Hit Dice would normally be entitled to; if 
this occurs, any "extra" feats are denoted as bonus feats.</p>
<p align="left">This process also may give the entomanothrope fewer 
feats than a character of its total Hit Dice would normally be entitled 
to; if this occurs, choose additional feats for the entomanothrope so 
that it has the correct number of feats.</p>
<p align="left">A entomanothrope may not meet the prerequisites for all 
its feats when in humanoid or giant form. If this occurs, the 
entomanothrope still has the feats, but cannot use them when in humanoid
 or giant form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Environment: </b>Same as either the base creature or base vermin.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Organization: </b>Solitary or colony (colony size dependent on base vermin).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Challenge Rating: </b>By class level or base 
creature, modified according to the Hit Die of the base vermin: 1 HD or 2
 HD, +2; 3 HD to 5 HD, +3, 6 HD to 10 HD, +5, 11 HD to 20 HD, +6; 21 or 
more HD, +7.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Treasure: </b>Standard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Alignment:</b> Same as base creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Advancement:</b> By character class.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Level Adjustment:</b> Same as the base creature +2. 
In addition, an entomanothrope's character level is increased by the 
number of racial Hit Dice the base vermin has.</p>
