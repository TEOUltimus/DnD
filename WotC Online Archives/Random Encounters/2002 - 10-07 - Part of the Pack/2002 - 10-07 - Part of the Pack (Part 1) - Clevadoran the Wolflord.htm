<p class="size2"><b>Clevadoran the Wolflord</b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2010-07%20-%20Part%20of%20the%20Pack%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Clevadoran%20the%20Wolflord_files/re_cleva_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="229" width="194">The
 wilderness is home to many creatures both friendly and dangerous. Some 
would say that the most dangerous are the ones that walk on two legs, 
but in the fantastic world of <b>D&amp;D</b>, there are always 
surprises. You may, for example, see a wolf standing before you and not 
realize that it is far more dangerous than it looks. For this wolf might
 be the wolflord Clevadoran looking you over.</p>
<p class="size2">Clevadoran is an elf who identified with wolves from 
his earliest days. He so identified with them that he became a protector
 of the packs. His appreciation of the pack social structure caused him 
to want to spread it to others, and his role as the leader came so 
naturally to him that he never considered any other role for himself in 
the world pack. He really believes that every creature would be better 
off as a wolf that is under his guidance. Somewhere he missed the 
lessons about the benefits of biodiversity, but no one's perfect. Now he
 uses his abilities to protect and control his lupine friends and to 
capture other creatures and have them transformed into wolves.</p>
<p class="size2">Clevadoran is approaching his 150th year, and he always
 has a rugged appearance (even when wearing clothing). He has leather 
armor that he wears almost constantly, but he prefers his lupine form to
 any other. He spends much of his time in wolf form but is perfectly 
willing to assume his elven form if it is more advantageous for him. He 
is a clever fighter, preferring to set ambushes and hunt with his pack. 
When caught alone, he tends to flee. He is not cowardly so much as he 
has a wolf's mentality: The pack is stronger than an individual wolf.</p>
<p class="size2">Clevadoran's den is the home of many wolves, as well as
 his cohort Miskeine, an elven sorcerer. The den is far from any 
humanoid settlement, but close enough that he can reach civilization 
without too many days' travel. Clevadoran often roams the streets of 
towns in elven or animal form, seeking those who are alone so that he 
can bring them into the pack.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="530"><tbody><tr><td>

<p class="size2"><b>Animal Bond:</b> At 1st level, Clevadoran developed a
 bond with wolves. Because of this bond, all wolves and animals closely 
related to wolves automatically have a friendly attitude toward him. 
Clevadoran can also have one or more wolf companions. This aspect is a 
spell-like ability that functions like the druid's <i>animal friendship </i>spell,
 except that Clevadoran can acquire only 12 HD worth of animals. 
Clevadoran can train these animal companions just as a druid does.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Companion:</b> Clevadoran can have one or more animal companions. This animal is one that he has befriended with the spell <i>animal friendship. </i>The total Hit Dice of all animal companions at a time cannot exceed 5.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Animal Farspeech</i> (Sp):</b> Clevadoran can use his animal speech ability to converse telepathically with any wolf that he can sense.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Animal Perception </i>(Sp):</b> Clevadoran can share the sensory input of any wolf that is within range of his animal sense.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Sense (Su):</b> Clevadoran can sense any 
wolves within a 36-mile radius. This ability does not allow Clevadoran 
to communicate with the animals he senses.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Speech (Ex):</b> Clevadoran can converse at will with any wolves as though a <i>speak with animals </i>spell were in effect. The wolves' responses, of course, are limited by their intelligence and perceptions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Elf Traits: </b>Clevadoran is immune to magic <i>sleep</i>
 spells and effects. He has a +2 racial bonus on saves against 
enchantment spells or effects. He also has low-light vision (can see 
twice as far as a human in low-light conditions) and is entitled to a 
Search check when within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door as though 
actively looking for it. Clevadoran has Martial Weapon Proficiency 
(composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, longsword, and rapier) 
as bonus feats. He also has a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and 
Search checks (already figured into the statistics given above).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Favored Enemy:</b> Clevadoran has selected humans as
 a favored enemy. He gains a +1 bonus on his Bluff, Listen, Sense 
Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks when using these skills against
 this type of creature. He gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls 
against creatures of this type. He also gets the damage bonus with 
ranged weapons if the target is within 30 feet. The bonus doesn't apply 
to damage against creatures that are immune to critical hits.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>First Totem:</b> Clevadoran gains Scent as a bonus feat (included above).</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Lesser Wild Shape</i> (Sp):</b> Clevadoran can use <i>wild shape</i> to take the form of any natural wolf. This ability otherwise functions like a druid's <i>wild shape, </i>except that Clevadoran can use it as often as desired.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Nature Sense: </b>Clevadoran can identify plants and
 animals (their species and special traits) with perfect accuracy. He 
can determine whether water is safe to drink or dangerous.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Resist Nature's Lure: </b>Clevadoran gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, nymphs, and sprites).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Second Totem:</b> Clevadoran gains a +4 circumstance
 bonus on Wilderness Lore checks made for tracking. This bonus stacks 
with any modifier provided by Scent.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Share Lesser Form</i> (Sp): </b>Clevadoran can share wolf form with 6 willing individuals. This effect is identical to that of the <i>polymorph other</i> spell, except that its duration is 6 hours.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Summon Animal</i> (Sp): </b>Twice per day, Clevadoran can summon 1d3 wolves. This ability functions like the appropriate <i>summon nature's ally</i> spell, except that the duration is 1 round per animal lord level (6 rounds). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trackless Step:</b> Clevadoran leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Wild Shape</i> (Sp): </b>Clevadoran can change into a Small or Medium-size animal and back again once per day as per the <i>polymorph self </i>spell.
 Unlike the standard use of the spell, however, he can adopt only one 
form per use of this ability. Clevadoran regains hit points as if he has
 rested for a day. He does not risk the standard penalty for being 
disoriented while in his <i>wild shape. </i>He gains all the creature's natural and extraordinary abilities when he does so.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Woodland Stride: </b>Clevadoran can move through 
natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his 
normal speed and without suffering damage or other impairment. However, 
thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically 
manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Druid Spells Prepared</b> (5/4/3/2; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 -- <i>animal trick*, detect magic, light, mending, purify food and drink; </i>1st -- <i>camouflage*, entangle, magic fang, sandblast*; </i>2nd -- <i>briar web*, charm person or animal, speed of the wind*; </i>3rd -- <i>spike growth, trackless domain**. </i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wolflord Spells Prepared</b> (2/2/2; save DC 13 + spell level): 1st -- <i>animal trick*, camouflage*; </i>2nd -- <i>adrenaline surge*, animal reduction*;</i> 3rd -- <i>cure serious wounds, embrace the wild*.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Possessions:</b> Small wolf's head amulet (divine focus), <i>wilding clasp</i> (from <i>Masters of the Wild</i>,
 a small clasp that prevents what it is attached to from melding into a 
new form when shapechanging powers are used) attached to divine focus, <i>+2 wild leather armor</i> (from <i>Masters of the Wild</i>, wild armor melds with creatures using <i>wild shape</i> and continues to provide a bonus; it is not visible in the melded form), <i>cloak of elvenkind</i>, <i>boots of elvenkind</i>, <i>cloak of the servant</i>, <i>potion of cat's grace</i>(2), shortspear.</p>
<p class="size2">*These feats and spells come from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88164">Masters of the Wild</a></i>. The feats are summarized below, but the spells are not.</p>
<p class="size2">**See a later installment for this spell description. You can also substitute another spell for the one listed until then.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Control: </b>He can rebuke or command animals as an evil cleric rebukes undead. To command an animal, he must be able to speak with it via a <i>speak with animals</i>
 effect, though he can issue commands mentally if desired. He can do 
this 5 times per day (3 + Cha modifier). His highest (divine) caster 
level is the level at which he turns animals. Animals commanded through 
this ability count against the total HD limit of animals he can befriend
 through <i>animal friendship</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Defiance:</b> He can turn (but not destroy) 
creatures of the animal type as a good cleric turns undead. He can do 
this 5 times per day (3 + Cha modifier). His highest (divine) caster 
level is the level at which he turns animals.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Natural Spell: </b>He can complete verbal and somatic components of spells while in <i>wild shape</i>.
 He can use material components or focuses that he can hold with his 
current form, but he cannot make use of items melded into the new form. 
This feat does not permit the use of magic items while in a form that 
could not ordinarily use them, and it does not grant the ability to 
speak while in <i>wild shape</i>. (Note that he chooses all his spells so that they can be completed while in <i>wild shape</i>.)</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scent:</b> He gains the Scent extraordinary ability (air-breather variety). See Chapter 3 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>. It operates in any form.</p>
