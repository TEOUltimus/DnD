<p class="size2"><b>Corrupting Touch (Su): </b>When Zephyr hits a living target with his corrupting touch attack, he deals 1d4 points of damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Moan (Su): </b>Zephyr can moan as a 
standard action. Each living creature within a 30-foot spread must 
succeed at a Will save (DC 12) or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This 
is a sonic, necromantic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that 
successfully saves against the moan cannot be affected by Zephyr's moan 
for one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Malevolence (Su):</b> Once per round, Zephyr can merge his body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to <i>magic jar </i>(caster
 level 10th), except that it does not require a receptacle. If the 
attack succeeds, Zephyr's body vanishes into the opponent's body. The 
target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 12). A 
creature that successfully saves is immune to Zephyr's malevolence for 
one day.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trip (Ex): </b>If Zephyr hits with a bite attack, he
 can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a 
touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attack fails,
 the opponent cannot react to trip Zephyr.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>As an ethereal creature, 
Zephyr cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. 
When manifested, he becomes visible but remains incorporeal. However, 
when manifested, Zephyr can strike with his corrupting touch attack. 
Zephyr remains on the Ethereal Plane but can be attacked by opponents on
 both the Material and Ethereal planes when manifested.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scent (Ex):</b> Zephyr can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Turn Resistance (Ex):</b> Zephyr is treated as an undead with 4 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, command, rebuke, or bolster attempts.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Undead Traits:</b> Zephyr is immune to poison, <i>sleep,</i>
 paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, 
mind-influencing effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects. He is not subject to critical hits, 
subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative
 energy heals him, and he is not at risk of death from massive damage 
but is destroyed at 0 hit points or below. He has darkvision (60-foot 
range). Zephyr cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if he is 
willing.</p>

<p class="size2">Zephyr was Clevadoran's earliest animal companion, and 
the two loved each other dearly. They were together for several years 
before Zephyr was killed by some orc sorcerers. The animal rose as a 
ghost and still follows Clevadoran as he did when he was alive. His 
loyalty goes beyond the grave. Zephyr does not count against 
Clevadoran's limit of animal companions, but he acts as an animal 
companion.</p>
<p class="size2">Zephyr has the ability to take over the bodies of 
material creatures (malevolence). When he does this, the body appears to
 transform into that of a wolf of whatever size category that the 
original creature had. This effect is illusionary, but very frightening 
to observers. Zephyr's victims appear to move like wolves, but they 
always have a ghostly luminescent aura around the apparent wolf form. <i>True seeing</i> effects show the victim in its real form, but the luminescent glow remains.</p>

<p class="size2">Clevadoran rescued Mica from a mad wizard about a year 
ago. Clevadoran had heard that this wizard was experimenting with 
transmutation, and visited him, but became angry when he saw what the 
wizard was really doing: merging mechanical parts with living creatures.
 When he left the wizard's fortress, all in it were dead except Mica, 
who Clevadoran befriended and added to his pack.</p>
<p class="size2">Mica looks slightly larger than a normal wolf, though 
this is merely the effects of metallic armor under her skin. Her most 
prominent features are her large jaw and mechanical nose. The mechanical
 parts cause Mica pain all the time, and so she is forever restless, 
irritable, and snaps into angry moods easily. The other animals give her
 a wide berth, and her isolation from the pack makes her worse. She 
spends as much time as possible with Clevadoran and is very loyal (even 
more than one would expect from an <i>animal friendship</i> spell). It is especially nice, from Mica's point of view, that Clevadoran can speak with her.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">If you wish to draw the wolves into the PCs' lives, you
 can either do so with Clevadoran or come up with something else. 
Perhaps Mica stumbles across the PCs while in a very bad mood, and 
Clevadoran barely gets there in time to calm Mica down. Another option 
is that the ghost wolf is very concerned over some parentless cubs that 
it discovered while out without Clevadoran. Will the PCs figure out what
 Zephyr is trying to tell them or simply attack?</p>
