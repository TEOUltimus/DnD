 week's installment presents the final undead stalker sent by a 
mysterious master villain to kill the player characters of your 
campaign. As noted in previous parts of this series, the identity and 
powers of the mastermind are left to DMs to determine, but this week's 
article includes advice on how to adapt the undead creature detailed 
herein to become that evil mastermind for DMs who need one.</p>
<p align="left">The undead being that is now sent after the PCs is a 
swordwraith. The swordwraith is actually an undead template that can be 
applied to any humanoid or monstrous humanoid that had fighter levels 
while it lived. The template is detailed below; DMs are encouraged to 
apply this template to one (or perhaps more) past fighter foes of the 
heroes who now (or so the PCs think) lie in musty graves -- victims of 
the heroes' righteous might. The mastermind villain could have learned 
enough about the PCs to have found these dead foes and created 
swordwraiths from them, thus allowing the forgotten foes a chance at 
revenge. Alternatively, DMs can take the sample NPC fighter write-ups 
from Chapter 4 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i> and apply the template to an NPC of an appropriate level.</p>
<p align="left">This portion of Part 4 assumes that the swordwraith is 
merely the latest minion sent by the evil master villain to torment the 
PCs. (For those DMs seeking the mastermind itself, see the "Mastermind 
Option" below.) Swordwraiths are mentioned in the <i>Fiend Folio</i> as 
being mercenaries so devoted to their craft that they carry on waging 
war even after death. Broadening that interpretation allows us to use 
dead past foes of the PCs themselves to serve as the fodder from which 
the swordwraiths are made. Perhaps the heroes encountered an evil 
mercenary troop at some point, they fought against the warriors of an 
evil cult or secret society, or they may have eliminated a band of evil 
soldiers or a den of evil creatures. After all, what self-respecting 
party of PCs hasn't wiped an orc, gnoll, or bugbear warband in its 
history?</p>
<p align="left">Once you know where the swordwraith came from, it's time
 to send it at the PCs. Be certain to apply the template to a creature 
with sufficient levels to challenge the party on its own. Also, don't 
forget to equip it as you would any other NPC foe of the heroes -- the 
gear and magic items were those the swordwraith had while it lived. (If 
any of the PCs ever took a magic item from a dead foe and that foe is 
now a swordwraith, that undead will likely make the PC looter its first 
target.) Or, the master villain could have learned from past encounters 
that sending just one (or two) seekers of the heroes' lives simply 
leaves the undead too outnumbered to prevail, and so she prepares a 
larger number of swordwraiths to attack the PCs -- perhaps she sends as 
many as there are heroes.</p>
<p align="left">When and where this attempt on the heroes' lives takes 
place remains up to the DMs. Since this may well be the climactic battle
 of this series of events (at least until the characters find the master
 villain), this battle should be grand in scale and deadly in the 
extreme. Don't forget to have the foe utter the following words, if you 
wish: "I am sent to destroy you, and so you shall die."</p>
<p align="left"><i>Mastermind Option:</i> The aforementioned option to 
make this swordwraith the actual mastermind behind this series of 
attacks requires a bit more work on the part of DMs, but the payoff can 
be worth it for those DMs who want to subject their players to this 
series of events but lack a suitable villain to play the role of the 
mastermind behind it all. The swordwraith template can be applied to 
humanoid and monstrous humanoid creatures that possessed levels in the 
fighter class while they lived. Nowhere in the template does it say that
 the humanoids must have had class levels in only the fighter class. A 
swordwraith with multiple levels in wizard, cleric, or sorcerer (and the
 right assortment of magic items, including a <i>crystal ball</i> with <i>clairaudience</i>)
 could provide the means by which the mastermind observes the PCs and 
sends the parade of undead killers after them. Such a creature would be a
 truly formidable opponent with its wide range of abilities and powers. 
Thus, after the failure of several of its undead minions, the powerful 
mastermind decides to personally destroy the characters. Further, since 
it's already been established that this being prefers to use lesser 
undead, it's likely that the swordwraith would enter this battle aided 
(if not surrounded) by lesser undead beings, perhaps led by a quth-maren
 or an abyssal ghoul.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swordwraith Template</b></p>
<p align="left">This template can be added to any humanoid or monstrous 
humanoid creature with levels in fighter (hereafter referred to as the 
"base creature"). The creature's type changes to undead. It uses all the
 base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hit Dice:</b> Increase to d12.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Attacks:</b> A swordwraith retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following attack.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Strength Damage (Su):</i> A creature struck by a 
swordwraith's melee weapon takes 1 point of temporary Strength damage in
 addition to normal damage from the weapon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Qualities:</b> A swordwraith retains all the special qualities of the base creature and also gains the following special qualities.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Damage Reduction (Su):</i> A swordwraith's 
insubstantial-seeming body is tough, giving it DR 10/magic and slashing.
 Despite their appearance, swordwraiths are corporeal.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Turn Resistance (Ex):</i> A swordwraith is treated as
 an undead with 2 more Hit Dice than it actually has for the purposes of
 turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Abilities:</b> Same as the base creature except that, as undead, it has no Constitution score.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills:</b> Swordwraiths gain a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Feats:</b> Swordwraiths gain the Alertness and Iron Will feats.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Environment:</b> Any land or underground.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Organization:</b> Solitary, company (2-8), or squadron (11-20 plus 1 leader of 1-4 levels higher).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as the base creature +2.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Treasure:</b> Standard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Alignment:</b> Usually lawful evil.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Advancement:</b> By character class.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Level Adjustment: </b>+3</p>
<p align="left"><i>Description:</i> Swordwraiths appear much as they did
 in life, though their equipment is battered and dirty and their flesh 
seems insubstantial. In dim lighting or darkness, their eyes can be seen
 to glow a hot yellow like the sun. As most were mercenaries during 
their lives, many swordwraiths still wear insignia from the mercenary 
company or order they belonged to in life.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="left">If the heroes prevail, two things should come about. 
Their victory should be one that the players still talk about months or 
years from now as they discuss great battles they played in the past, 
and the players should be highly motivated to seek out the mastermind 
that has sent so many undead with death on their minds and these words 
on their lips, "I am sent to destroy you, and so you shall die." The 
insignia worn by the defeated swordwraiths can be the first clue in a 
train of evidence that eventually leads to the very doorstep of the 
master villain who tried for so long to prevent this very event from 
coming to pass: the PCs' payback for all the trouble they've been put 
through by this mastermind.</p>
