 attacks by the undead detailed in this series should be challenging and
 dangerous, but not obviously lethal. The Challenge Ratings of these 
encounters range from the CR 7 quth-maren upward. Since all these undead
 beings are intelligent, they do not simply charge the massed PCs the 
first time they spot the heroes. The undead may track the party for some
 time, hoping to determine their overall power level, current degree of 
fitness, and any weaknesses the PCs may have. These undead time their 
attacks to take advantage of any special abilities they possess, as well
 as waiting for the party to be weakened from previous encounters. They 
may also lure a small number of the heroes away from the larger group 
and into an ambush, or methodically disrupt a spellcasters' attempts to 
rest and regain spells. Each undead knows that it is outnumbered by the 
characters, and each one will seek every tactical advantage it can to 
balance the scales. Consider what it might be like to be pursued by a 
relentless foe that needs no rest, food, or water to sustain it.</p>
<p align="left">Wary or paranoid PCs should be given normal chances to 
detect the undead before it strikes at them, but only if the heroes are 
aware they're being tracked or observed.</p>
<p align="left">The best way to slip this encounter into your campaign 
is to add the abyssal ghoul to a band of standard ghouls and/or ghasts. 
When even a mid-level party is swarmed by a bunch of undead with the 
ability to paralyze their foes so the victims can be eaten at the 
undead's leisure, the physical differences between the abyssal ghoul and
 its more common counterparts may go unnoticed for a few critical 
moments. Then, suddenly, the CR 10 creature is among the PCs, wreaking 
as much lethal havoc as it can for the master who set it upon the 
heroes.</p>
<p align="left">Don't spring this encounter on the characters too soon 
after they meet and defeat the quth-maren, though. Allow some real time 
and game time to pass before the mastermind looses the next would-be 
assassin on the heroes.</p>
<p align="left">If the players noted the unusual circumstances or 
abilities of the quth-maren or the single sentence it spoke to them in 
the first part of the series, allow them to check around for leads 
regarding just what the creature was, why it attacked, and who sent it. 
With suitable research, inquiries, and skill check results, give the 
players details on the quth-maren itself, perhaps embellished with a 
healthy dose of legend, rumor, and hyperbole.</p>
<p align="left">If the players took no particular notice of the 
quth-maren's statement, its abilities, or its rarity (which is assumed 
for most campaigns), don't worry and don't go out of your way to point 
out the odd nature of the undead and its stated mission. (It'll be that 
much more satisfying for you later on when the players finally put all 
the pieces together and they smack their foreheads when they realize 
that the quth-maren was the first tool of the master villain.) </p>
<p align="left">You may want to set this encounter on the PCs when 
they're traveling, especially if it's through strange or unknown 
territory. The mastermind villain has sent the abyssal ghoul to do what 
the quth-maren failed to do: Wipe out the heroes. In a dark forest, a 
remote alpine valley, an abandoned cemetery, a dank swamp, a foreign 
city's catacombs, or near the ruins of an ancient, perhaps cursed, 
dungeon, city, or wilderness settlement, the abyssal ghoul waits for the
 heroes. The abyssal ghoul knows it needs the presence of normal ghouls,
 ghasts, or other lesser undead with which it can blend or at least be 
initially mistaken for. The ghoul need not work directly with these 
other undead, although that's certainly a possibility, especially if the
 CR 10 creature isn't going to pose a significant threat to the party on
 its own.</p>
<p align="left">In either case, the PCs should have fought ghouls or 
similar undead recently and could reasonably expect to do so again in 
the near future. Aware of this (and actually counting on it), the 
abyssal ghoul shadows the party as it moves or lurks in the dimmest 
shadows just beyond the camp's watch fire. The abyssal ghoul hopes to 
lure overconfident or careless characters into pursuing it, at which 
time it leads these PCs away from their comrades. After suitable time 
and distance have elapsed, the abyssal ghoul turns from prey to hunter, 
attacking the PCs and hoping to overwhelm them as quickly as possible. 
By the time they notice this creature is no ordinary ghoul, it could be 
too late.</p>
<p align="left">If this tactic fails, the abyssal ghoul finds a suitable
 location from which it can launch an ambush that allows it to make use 
of its sneak attack ability. The most likely target for such an attack 
is a cleric or paladin, followed by wizards or sorcerers.</p>
<p align="left">Regardless of how it attacks, when it does so, it utters
 a single, sinister sentence (if the DM chooses), "I am sent to destroy 
you, and so you shall die." If the abyssal ghoul is attacking the party 
on its own, it most likely avoids using its improved grab ability as 
that would make it too easy a target for the other PCs. The only 
possible exception to this is if the abyssal ghoul gets a cleric PC 
alone; then the undead makes every attempt to pin the PC to use its 
Wisdom drain ability. The abyssal ghoul uses its <i>deathwatch</i> 
ability to monitor any PCs near death. It does it best to finish off any
 PC close to death's door before turning to face healthier foes. It 
fights to the death.</p>
<p align="left">If a single abyssal ghoul is not a sufficient challenge 
to your PCs, have the creature attack alongside the previously mentioned
 pack of standard ghouls or ghasts or add a second abyssal ghoul to the 
plan.</p>

+20, Jump +23, Move Silently +20, Tumble +20; Dodge, Improved 
Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Multiattack, Spring Attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Disease (Ex): </b>Any creature hit by an abyssal 
ghoul's claw attack must succeed on a DC 18 Fort save or contract demon 
fever (see Table 8-2: Diseases on page 292 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex): </b>If an abyssal ghoul hits a 
Medium or smaller foe with both front claws, it deals normal damage and 
attempts to start a grapple as a free action without invoking an attack 
of opportunity. If it gets a hold, it can attempt to pin and use its 
Wisdom drain ability on its next grapple check. Each successful grapple 
check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals damage from 
both front claws.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>Any time an abyssal ghoul's 
target is denied its Dexterity bonus or when an abyssal ghoul flanks a 
target, the ghoul deals an additional 5d6 points of damage on a 
successful melee attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wisdom Drain (Su): </b>If an abyssal ghoul 
successfully pins a living opponent, it can drain 1d6 points of Wisdom 
with its smoky tongue on the same action. Each subsequent round that the
 hold is maintained, the abyssal ghoul automatically drains an 
additional 1d6 points of Wisdom. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom by an 
abyssal ghoul becomes unconscious until at least 1 point of Wisdom is 
restored.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> An abyssal ghoul is blind, but 
it maneuvers as well as a sighted creature by using scent and vibration 
to ascertain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern 
objects and creatures within 90 feet. An abyssal ghoul does not normally
 need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of 
its blindsight.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Deathwatch</i> (Sp): </b>This ability functions like the <i>deathwatch</i>
 spell, except that it's always active, and an abyssal ghoul always 
knows how near death all creatures within 90 feet of it are. Because of 
this, the abyssal ghoul often chooses to kill creatures near death 
before moving on to attack healthier foes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge: </b>An abyssal ghoul cannot be flanked except by a rogue of 20th level or higher.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>An abyssal ghoul retains it Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> An abyssal ghoul is immune to 
mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability 
scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from 
massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it 
is willing.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Description:</i> An abyssal ghoul resembles a 
standard ghoul in that it is a warped figure of a humanoid with bestial 
features. Its skin is scaly and tough, and its fingers and toes end in 
fearsome claws several inches in length. It also possesses long, sharp 
teeth and a foot-long tongue that trails in smoky incorporeality at its 
tip.</p>

<p align="left">Another verbal clue from the latest undead may have the 
PCs wondering what's going on. You can continue to make things look 
ominous, but choose your moments, and make them small things. Any 
paranoid PC in the party is bound to be twitchy to start with, but this 
can certainly make him or her feel that the worst is yet to come.</p>
