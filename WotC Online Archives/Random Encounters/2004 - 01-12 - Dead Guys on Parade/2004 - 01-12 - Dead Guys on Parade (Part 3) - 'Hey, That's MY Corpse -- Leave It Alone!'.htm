 readers will note that this week's encounter is rated as CR 9, whereas 
Part 2 of this series detailed an encounter with an abyssal ghoul, which
 has a CR of 10. Here is the reason: Part 1 detailed a simple, outright 
attack on the heroic characters; Part 2 dealt more with the undead 
trying to use subterfuge to convince the PCs that it was a less 
dangerous variety of undead. The level of subterfuge used by the 
mysterious master villain who is sending these undead to attack the 
party increases again this time with the appearance of the 
corpse-stealing bhut.</p>
<p align="left">The mysterious master villain behind these repeated 
attacks by the undead on the heroes takes a different tack now that the 
first two undead sent to kill the PCs have failed. The villain hopes to 
catch the heroes off their guards. The bhut's plan is as follows.</p>
<p align="left">The bhut journeys to whatever town, base, or citadel the
 PCs call home. How it reaches here is left to DM's discretion, but the 
bhut will likely use a freshly killed corpse to move about, since that 
form protects it from its vulnerability to earth and stone. The bhut 
avoids contact with the effects of civilization while it travels, moving
 through difficult terrain as opposed to using roads and so on. As an 
undead, it needs no food or shelter. Despite its care, however, rumors 
may arise around the PCs' home of zombies wandering through the woods, 
scaring livestock or children, or bodies of corpses the bhut abandons 
might be found as well.</p>
<p align="left">Once the bhut arrives in the area, it begins to study 
the habits of the heroes: the places they go, the people they visit, the
 inns they drink at, and so on. As PCs often let their guards down at 
home, the bhut's first plan is to attack and kill a lone PC, then 
possess the corpse, and go to the other characters. The pretext is, of 
course, the horrible attack (by a demon or other suitably fearsome and 
campaign-appropriate monster or creature) that the lone hero barely 
fought off. Once the bhut has gathered as many of the PCs as possible 
near it, it attacks using the animated corpse. This tactic not only 
continues to protect the bhut from its earth vulnerability, but it also 
forces the other PCs to attack and "kill" their former PC ally (see 
"Note" below for more on this). When the body is reduced to 0 hp, the 
bhut emerges and makes immediate use of its dreadful appearance power as
 it says (if the DM chooses), "I am sent to destroy you, and so you 
shall die."</p>
<p align="left">If no opportunity presents itself for the bhut to kill a
 lone PC, it alters its target to a trusted NPC all the characters know.
 This NPC may be a lover, a family friend, a mentor, a henchman or 
apprentice, a relative, an innkeeper, or any other person well known to 
the heroes. Once the bhut chooses such a target, it attacks and kills 
it, then animates the corpse to use it to get close enough to the 
characters to attack. Again, if it can get one of the PCs alone, it then
 attempts to kill the hero and get back to its original plan.</p>
<p align="left">If a single bhut will not challenge your campaign's 
heroes, bear in mind that the PCs may not carry all their gear and 
weapons when they are "at home." Certainly, they'd not be lugging their 
backpacks full of torches, potions, flint and steel, empty sacks for 
loot, and so on. Similarly, most folks in cities and even small towns 
don't wear 50 pounds of armor all day, every day, just to go to the inn.
 If you don't know what the PCs carry on their person when they are at 
ease, find out well before the battle with the bhut takes place. After 
considering this, if a single bhut still lacks the punch you want from 
this encounter, add a second to the mission of the master villain.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Note:</i> The best-case scenario to play out the 
one-on-one battle of the PC versus the bhut is for it to take place 
outside the normal time devoted to your regular game; ask the player of 
the PC the bhut attacks to come over early that week and resolve the 
battle before the others arrive. The battle may take some time to 
resolve, and you don't want to leave the other players with nothing to 
do while you and one of the players go into another room to roll dice to
 see who wins and who dies. If you game with folks who are mature enough
 to keep player knowledge and character knowledge separate, the 
situation may not be that bad. The other players might vicariously enjoy
 watching the battle between their friend's PC and the mysterious 
creature play out at the gaming table. Just make it clear that this is a
 one-on-one battle (unless you decide otherwise). Also, since this is 
the third attack by undead creatures, the players may have their 
characters take special care to protect themselves. The bhut probably 
waits until the PCs drop their guard, but canny PCs might lure it in by 
pretending to be vulnerable.</p>
<p align="left">If the PC kills the bhut, then you've helped create a 
great story of a desperate struggle where a lone PC (likely without at 
least some of his or her standard adventuring equipment, as mentioned 
above) bravely destroyed the vile undead thing sent to kill her and all 
her allies.</p>
<p align="left">If the bhut kills the PC, however, you have a decision 
to make. If the hero's player is mature enough to handle the situation, 
ask him to continue to play the character at the next game session. A 
good roleplayer could have a lot of fun playing the animated corpse of 
his hero, which is now trying to kill all his former friends. If the 
player needs a little enticement, perhaps you can offer him something 
(XP, a minor magic item, and so on) for his next character that 
convinces him to go along. Once you have the player on board with your 
plan, explain the bhut's strategy and goal, but do not reveal the true 
identity of the mastermind villain behind the scheme. It's possible that
 the bhut doesn't know in detail for whom it's working -- it just wants 
the chance to kill. If the PCs survive the bhut's attacks and the dead 
hero somehow is returned to life, it's fine to let the PC remember a few
 clues (to be devised by DMs as suits their campaigns) about where the 
bhut came from, a location where it had contact with the mastermind, or a
 magical code phrase to be spoken under the light of a full moon that 
allows the bhut to report its progress to the mastermind, and so on.</p>

Disguise +16, Intimidate +18, Listen +10, Spot +10, Survival +10; Dodge,
 Mobility, Spring Attack, Track.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Augmented Critical (Ex): </b>A bhut's bite attack 
threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 19-20 and deals 
triple normal damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dreadful Appearance (Su): </b>Anyone within 30 feet 
of a bhut must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of 
temporary Strength damage. A victim can be affected only once by a 
specific bhut's appearance, but the effects of failing to save against 
multiple bhuts are cumulative.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Su): </b>A bhut delivers its poison 
(Fortitude DC 14 negates) with a successful bite attack. Initial and 
secondary damage are both 2d6 points of temporary Wisdom damage. Anyone 
reduced to 0 Wisdom by bhut poison lapses into a coma and dies in 1d4 
hours unless the poison is neutralized. A humanoid creature slain in 
this manner rises as a bhut with the next sunset.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Corpsetheft (Su):</b> As a full-round action, a bhut 
can possess a humanoid corpse of any size. The body animates immediately
 and is under the bhut's full control; treat it as a zombie of the 
appropriate size with the following exceptions: The animated body 
retains the bhut's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
 the bhut's alignment, base attack bonus, hit points, base saving 
throws, and level and class (if any). Further, the body is not limited 
to single actions. Also, the bhut's bite still delivers the bhut's 
poison but the bite itself is no longer a natural attack (-4 penalty on 
attack rolls). It deals only 1d3 points of damage and it provokes an 
attack of opportunity. In addition, as long as the bhut inhabits the 
body, it is not affected by its earth vulnerability, and it does not 
gain the benefits of its augmented critical or dreadful appearance 
abilities. If the body is reduced to 0 hit points, the bhut must exit 
the body and return to its incorporeal state; any damage done to the 
body is not transferred to the bhut's true form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Earth Vulnerability (Su): </b>A bhut cannot abide 
contact with earth or stone when in its incorporeal state, and it cannot
 pass through such matter without taking 3d6 points of damage per round.
 Stone and earth weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of damage when 
they strike an incorporeal bhut, and they do not have a miss chance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Incorporeal Traits: </b>A bhut is harmed only by 
other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like 
abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any
 damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks 
made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but 
not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and
 shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against
 them. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard
 with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> An abyssal ghoul is immune to 
mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability 
scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from 
massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it 
is willing. Darkvision 60 ft.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Description:</i> A bhut's true form is terrifying to 
behold. It consists of a humanoid head with red, feral eyes, a mouth 
full of daggerlike teeth, and a roiling, half-formed body of sickening 
black smoke and dank red mist.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="left">Assuming the party survives the vicious bhut, it's 
likely that they make finding the source of these attacks a top 
priority. Any clues the returned-to-life PC has can set them on the 
right path. It's now up to DMs to determine how long the quest to find 
the master villain takes, but let's save that for next week.</p>
