<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2006-09%20-%20Fharlanghn%27s%20Garden%20%28Part%202%29%20-%20The%20Eternal%20Pilgrimage_files/DnD_JuneRE2_dsatx2.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="165" width="143">Devout
 followers of every religion will occasionally make pilgrimages, and 
worshipers of Fharlanghn are no exception. In many religions, pilgrims 
travel to large temples dedicated to their god or to particular spots 
where the deity is said to have trod the earth, but the followers of the
 Dweller on the Horizon do not have such destinations.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Very
 few major temples are constructed in Fharlanghn's name -- every road, 
street, path, and country lane are testaments to his majesty. And the 
god of roads prefers to be worshiped at small shrines built along his 
domain so that the faithful may pay their respects and then return to 
their journeys. Anyone who sets out on a holy journey in Fharlanghn's 
name joins a tradition known as the Eternal Pilgrimage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Eternal Pilgrimage is a journey made for the simple sake of celebrating
 the bounty provided by the god of roads. The trip has no prescribed 
beginning, destination, direction, or even length -- it is simply an act
 of personal devotion and lasts as long as the individual pilgrim feels 
is appropriate. The only duties a pilgrim has on his journey is to be a 
pleasant to those with whom he shares the road and to help other 
travelers whenever and wherever possible.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To
 become a pilgrim on the Eternal Pilgrimage, the individual must first 
have prepared his or her body and mind for the journey. Each aspirant 
must spend an entire year walking outdoors for at least 8 hours a day 
before going on the Eternal Pilgrimage. An aspirant's travels during 
this period must not take any other form than walking, and he or she 
cannot pass by the same locale more than once each month. Once a person 
becomes a pilgrim, he or she must continue walking at least 8 hours each
 day, refrain from traveling by any other means, and avoid visiting a 
locale more than once a day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Pilgrims
 offer to provide company to lonely wanderers -- it doesn't matter where
 they are headed because any destination is fine for the pilgrim. They 
are also always willing to share a campfire with strangers and offer 
food to anyone who looks hungry. They make it their business to become 
intimately familiar with the roads, towns, and customs in the areas 
through which they travel, and they can always aid anyone who is 
attempting an Intuit Direction or Knowledge (local) check (automatically
 providing the character with a +2 circumstance bonus to the roll). 
There is also a 40% chance that one of Fharlanghn's pilgrims can provide
 detailed knowledge of another, more distant location (their travels 
take them all over the map). Most pilgrims have information about 1d4 
different regions, although particularly dedicated (and wide-ranging) 
pilgrims may have information about as many as 2d6 different locales.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Any
 adventurers who spend much time journeying from place to place soon 
come to recognize the gray robes and decorative walking sticks common to
 many on the Eternal Pilgrimage. They should soon realize that these 
pilgrims truly are good samaritans, and their offers of assistance and 
comfort can be accepted freely without fear of betrayal or incurring an 
unexpected debt.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 time to time, bandits, outlaws, and other disreputable sorts have taken
 advantage of the pilgrims' good reputation. They don the faithful's 
robes to outwit local constables and militia or, worse, to gain the 
trust of travelers and then rob or murder them in their sleep.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Whenever
 word of such activities reaches participants in the Eternal Pilgrimage,
 they set their paths toward the affected region, where they offer their
 assistance in capturing the perpetrators. Until the imposters are 
caught, they travel in pairs whenever possible and greet one another 
with quotes from sacred texts. (Those participating in seeking imposters
 are temporarily relieved of the requirements of their travels in terms 
of the Eternal Pilgrimage.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bandits
 who presume to use Fharlanghn's good name to hide their activities had 
better hope that representatives of the law find them before the 
pilgrims do. Many incidents of "rogue pilgrims" end suddenly. The 
robberies cease, but the only clue the local authorities find is a 
bloodstained set of gray robes hanging from a noose strung up in a 
roadside tree. The owner of the robe is never found, and the actual 
pilgrims all disappear, seemingly overnight.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Fharlanghn's Garden</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Since
 those participating in the Eternal Pilgrimage are worshipers of 
Fharlanghn, adventurers may think to ask them for information about 
Journey's End or Fharlanghn's Garden. Most of the pilgrims (70%) 
honestly never have heard of any such place, although they say that it 
sounds marvelous and ask the adventurers for more details.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Other
 pilgrims (25%) say that they have heard stories about Journey's End, 
but that's all they are -- stories. They happily share these tales with 
the adventurers in exchange for their own rumors. About half of the 
rumors say that Fharlanghn's Garden lies in the middle of a vast desert.
 Other rumors place the garden in the heart of a fetid swamp, in land 
recently ravaged by earthquakes and volcanoes, nestled in a hot spring 
fed arctic valley, or as the only remaining habitable patch left after a
 devastating forest fire raged through the area. The two things that 
they all have in common are that Journey's End is located in an 
otherwise completely inhospitable location, and that the garden itself 
is the most beautiful, bountiful, idyllic patch of land in the world.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An
 extraordinarily small number of pilgrims (5%), though, respond to 
questions regarding Journey's End with silence and a cold, hard glare. 
If pressed, they say something enigmatic and ominous such as, "If 
Fharlanghn wanted visitors, he would place his front gate where all 
could see." Whatever the pilgrim says, the adventurers should clearly 
get two messages: that Journey's End is a real place, and that the 
pilgrim is certain that they are not welcome there.</span></p>
