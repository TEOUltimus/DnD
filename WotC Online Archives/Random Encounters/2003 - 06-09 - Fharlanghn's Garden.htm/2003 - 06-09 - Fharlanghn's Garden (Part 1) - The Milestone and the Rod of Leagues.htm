<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2006-09%20-%20Fharlanghn%27s%20Garden%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20The%20Milestone%20and%20the%20Rod%20of%20Leagues_files/DnD_JuneRE1_3dg2.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="150" width="150">What
 is it that every hero needs to complete a quest? Some would answer that
 philosophically by saying bravery or determination. Others would be 
pragmatic and say a sword or other weapon. Worshipers of Fharlanghn, 
though, will without hesitation tell you that the answer is a road.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Whether
 it is literal or figurative, every quest follows a path, and the only 
way to successfully complete the task at hand is to follow that path to 
its ultimate end. Of course, the more significant the quest is, the more
 winding the road will be, and the more side roads will lead away from 
the true goal. Correctly navigating these avenues and byways is the key 
to success.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 the god of roads, Fharlanghn might also be considered the god of 
quests. Over the years, his devotees have invented a pair of magic items
 designed to make it easier to find one's way along the road of life.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Milestone:</b>
 This small pendant, worn around the neck, is shaped like a marker one 
might find at a crossroads. Made of granite, each of its four sides is 
engraved with one of the cardinal compass points. By concentrating for 1
 round, the wearer can identify any compass direction she can name 
(examples include north, southwest, and east-northeast).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At will, someone wearing a <i>milestone</i> can find the shortest, most direct physical route to any location, as if she was the target of a <i>find the path</i>
 spell. To begin this effect, the wearer must spend 1 minute 
concentrating on the intended location. Once the stone is focused, it 
displays the current distance between the wearer and the intended 
locale. The distance appears as a number apparently carved on the 
appropriate face of the <i>milestone</i>. If the locale lies two miles 
to the north, a number 2 would appear on the side of the stone marked 
"North." Distance is measured in quarter mile units, and the distance 
may appear on two separate faces. (For example, distance might appear on
 both the north and west faces if the locale lies to the northwest). </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 6th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>find the path</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 64,800 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rod of Leagues:</b>
 This sturdy, 5-foot tall wooden rod looks like a walking stick (and can
 be used as one) and has the names of various cities, villages, and 
historical sites carved across its length. Once per day the rod may be 
activated to grant the wielder the benefits of an <i>expeditious retreat</i>
 spell; these effects last for up to 8 hours. If the wielder performs 
any action other than a move or free action, the effect ends 
immediately. When the effect ends, the wielder is fatigued.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Additionally, if a character casts a <i>teleport</i> spell while holding a <i>rod of leagues</i>, he may consider any locale that appears on the rod as someplace with which he is "very familiar." A <i>rod of leagues</i>
 can hold the names of up to 10 locales. When the rod is created, the 
creator may inscribe any 10 locales with which she is already very 
familiar; thereafter, the wielder may replace any of the existing 
locales with a locale of his choice. To do so, the wielder must 
currently be in the locale that he is adding and must spend 10 minutes 
using a dagger or other blade to carve the name of that place onto the 
rod on top of the locale that is being eliminated. Instead of wearing 
the rod away, the old locale name is magically erased and replaced with 
the new name. Once completed, the locale name appears in the normal 
handwriting of the carver, as though written with a fine pen rather than
 carved with a blade.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Using the <i>Milestone</i> and <i>Rod of Leagues</i> Together</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The <i>milestone</i> and <i>rod of leagues</i>
 are remarkably useful items, and they were created to celebrate the 
glory of Fharlanghn's providence. However, they have an additional 
function known only by the most faithful servants of the Dweller on the 
Horizon. The following information will be common knowledge to any 
cleric of Fharlanghn who has reached 8th level or higher. Other 
characters may discover it by succeeding at a bardic knowledge or 
Knowledge (religion) check (DC 30) or through use of the <i>legend lore</i> spell. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If one person holds both a <i>milestone</i> and a <i>rod of leagues</i>,
 a new place name appears on the rod. A wielder who is not specifically 
looking for this additional name must make a Spot check (DC 15) to 
notice it. The place name is "Journey's End." Unless the character 
succeeds at one of the Knowledge checks described above, this name has 
no meaning to him, and it cannot be found on any maps. Those who know 
say that Journey's End is a garden favored by Fharlanghn -- a blessed 
place where a traveler can find comfort, rest, and safety.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The <i>milestone</i> reveals the distance and direction to Journey's End only to someone who wields a <i>rod of leagues</i>. And although the rod cannot be used as a focus to <i>teleport</i> there (it is the one locale that is exempt to the rod's power), a wielder who also has a <i>milestone</i> can double the rod's movement abilities when traveling to Journey's End.</span></p>
