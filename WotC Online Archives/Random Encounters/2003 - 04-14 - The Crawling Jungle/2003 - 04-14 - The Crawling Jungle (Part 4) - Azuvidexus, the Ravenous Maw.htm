<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><img src="2003%20-%2004-14%20-%20The%20Crawling%20Jungle%20%28Part%204%29%20-%20Azuvidexus,%20the%20Ravenous%20Maw_files/DnD_AprilRE_4_vb3289.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="184" width="187">The
 heart and soul of the Crawling Jungle is Azuvidexus, a paragon 
half-fiend tyrannosaurus of immense power. Granted epic strength and 
power by the N'gharl Seed, Azuvidexus' goals and desires are all but 
inscrutable. In many ways, he seems to exist only to spread havoc and 
eat. To fully understand Azuvidexus, one must first know the history of 
this terrible being. This history is ancient and secret, and it should 
take many hours of research for a sage or a PC to piece it together. 
You'll find this history detailed in Part 1.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today,
 Azuvidexus is driven by the overwhelming power of the N'gharl Seed to 
spread the Crawling Jungle across the world. The seed wants nothing more
 than to reform and rebuild itself into the mighty jungle realm that 
once existed on the Abyss, and if it can find the proper place in the 
Prime Material Plane to gestate, it can take root and overwhelm the 
world. As of yet, it hasn't found such a place -- if it even exists. But
 the seed is relentless, and it drives Azuvidexus to wander the world, 
constantly in search of a place to take hold.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Azuvidexus
 isn't much larger than a standard tyrannosaurus in size, but he is 
incredibly more terrifying to behold. Everything about his appearance 
seems enhanced to bring out the capacity to inflict death; his teeth are
 huge, razor-sharp tusks, his claws gigantic and muscular and tipped 
with serrated talons, his head horned, and his maw seething with red 
fire. He even bears a set of impressive batlike wings. But easily the 
most disturbing are his eyes, for in those burning orbs of fiery orange 
pulses a terrible intelligence; Azuvidexus is a cunning and dangerous 
foe who understands fully that there is little in the world that can 
oppose his might. Although he has been defeated several times before, he
 retains the memories of his past lives. In particular, he holds dear 
the memories of how he was slain before and knows better than to fall 
victim to the same situation twice. Each time he is slain, he learns 
from his mistakes and becomes all the more difficult to destroy when 
next he rises from the Crawling Jungle.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b>
 If Azuvidexus hits a Large or smaller opponent with his bite attack, he
 deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action 
without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +77). If he 
gets a hold, he can try to swallow the opponent in the next round. 
Alternatively, Azuvidexus has the option to conduct the grapple 
normally, or simply use his jaws to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on 
grapple check, but Azuvidexus is not considered grappled). In either 
case, each successful grapple check he makes during successive rounds 
automatically deals bite damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>darkness, poison, unholy aura;</i> 1/day -- <i>blasphemy, contagion, desecrate, horrid wilting, summon monster IX</i> (fiends only), <i>unhallow, unholy blight.</i> Caster level 33rd, Save DC 31 + spell level. 3/day -- <i>haste, greater dispelling, see invisibility.</i> Caster level 15th; save DC 31 + spell level.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b>
 Azuvidexus can swallow a Medium-size or smaller opponent by making a 
successful grapple check (grapple bonus +77), provided that the opponent
 is already in his mouth at the start of his turn. Once inside 
Azuvidexus, the opponent takes 2d8+38 points of bludgeoning damage per 
round plus 8 points of acid damage per round from Azuvidexus's gizzard. A
 successful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of 
the gizzard and return to Azuvidexus's mouth, where another successful 
grapple check is needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature
 can try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or 
slashing weapon. Dealing at least 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC
 20) in this way creates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a
 single swallowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus,
 another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. Azuvidexus's 
gizzard can hold 2 Medium-size, 4 Small, 8 Tiny, 16 Diminutive, or 32 
Fine or smaller opponents.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b>
 Azuvidexus regains lost hit points at the rate of 20 per round. Fast 
healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or 
suffocation, and it does not allow Azuvidexus to regrow or reattach lost
 body parts.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Immortality:</b>
 If Azuvidexus is slain, petrified, imprisoned, or otherwise permanently
 disabled, the seed causes his physical body to vanish in a soundless 
wave of black necromantic fire. Each creature within 120 feet of him at 
this time must make a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 45) or gain 2d6
 negative levels. A successful save indicates that only 2 negative 
levels are gained. The Fortitude save to remove these negative levels is
 DC 40. The Crawling Jungle remains, but quickly dies off over a 
month-long period of rotting, and its evil inhabitants flee for new 
lairs. Approximately one hundred years later, the seed, Azuvidexus, and 
the Crawling Jungle manifest again at a random point elsewhere in the 
world.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Infusion (Su):</b>
 As a full-round action, Azuvidexus can infuse a humanoid creature he 
has swallowed with the fell energies of the seed. This process applies 
the fiendish template to the victim, unless it makes a successful 
Fortitude saving throw (DC 45). Azuvidexus then vomits up the new 
acolyte of the Ravenous Maw. Those who deny this gift and do not 
immediately choose Azuvidexus as their new master are eaten for real.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>N'gharl Seed (Su):</b>
 The N'gharl seed is no longer an artifact in its own right because it 
has bonded completely with Azuvidexus. In addition to the terrible 
transformation the seed wrought upon the dinosaur, it provides the 
paragon with two new abilities: infusion and immortality.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Outsider Traits:</b> Azuvidexus cannot be raised or resurrected (though a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell can restore life).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Scent (Ex):</b> Azuvidexus can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(The paragon creature template comes from the <i>Epic Level Handbook</i>.
 Several elements of this NPC stat block use concepts from this book, 
such as damage reduction that requires weapons of higher than +5 bonus 
to penetrate and caster levels higher than level 20. If you aren't 
comfortable with introducing these elements to your campaign, you can 
easily reduce them to the top end of the core rules. Azuvidexus will 
still be a fairly tough customer!)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Introducing Azuvidexus to Your Campaign</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Azuvidexus
 is a formidable opponent -- one who should test the mettle even of a 
20th-level party. Nevertheless, you can introduce him into a lower-level
 campaign in subtle ways. Perhaps the PCs hear rumors of a terrible 
dinosaur god worshiped by savage elves in a nearby wood, and they seek 
out these elves to determine the veracity of the claims. Or maybe they 
uncover a treasure map that leads to the "lair of Azuvidexus and his 
stolen kingdoms of gold." If you sprinkle the Ravenous Maw's name 
throughout the campaign, the PCs' final encounter with the beast should 
be all the more memorable.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 most obvious way to introduce Azuvidexus into your game is to have the 
N'gharl Seed manifest the Crawling Jungle and its lord in the PCs' 
vicinity. The Crawling Jungle manifests with incredible and frightening 
speed, filling a 20-mile diameter region with steaming, monster-infested
 jungle in approximately 10 minutes of explosive growth. Structures and 
cities in this area are terribly damaged by this manifestation, but the 
jungle is careful to not harm a single living thing during this growth 
period. It saves life for its hungry inhabitants . . .<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It
 is unclear where the seed goes during this time, but if Azuvidexus is 
to be forever defeated, the seed itself must be destroyed during its 
century-long hibernation. A powerful party that defeats Azuvidexus in 
the Crawling Jungle may think it has prevailed over the seed, but to 
finish the job they must find where the seed has vanished to and repeat 
the process. Just how this might be done is up to you, but it should be a
 much more difficult task than slaying Azuvidexus the first time ever 
was.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You
 should wait for the PCs to be fairly high level before you unleash the 
Crawling Jungle upon them; many of its inhabitants are quite dangerous 
and deadly. Also, having the jungle manifest in the PCs base of 
operations is an excellent way to force them to deal with the situation,
 although you should take care with such an option since this can 
radically alter the course of your campaign!</span></p>
