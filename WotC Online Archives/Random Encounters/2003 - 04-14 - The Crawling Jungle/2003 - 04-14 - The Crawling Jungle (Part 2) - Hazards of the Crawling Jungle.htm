 large numbers of dangerous monsters and cultists lurk in the Crawling 
Jungle, other often more subtle dangers in the jungle can spell doom for
 unwary adventurers or explorers. The jungle's environs are maintained 
by the presence of the N'gharl Seed, regardless of the surrounding 
terrain. Temperatures in the jungle hover at nearly 95° F, and as a 
result the place is usually surrounded by a thick fog that provides 
partial concealment (20% miss chance) to anything within. This fog 
generally penetrates a mile into the jungle.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Additionally,
 the jungle is swimming in disease. Natives of the jungle, including the
 Cultists of the Ravenous Maw, have become acclimated to these 
conditions and need not fear contracting disease simply from being in 
the jungle (although they can still become diseased via other vectors). 
Every day an intruder remains inside the Crawling Jungle, she is exposed
 to 1d4-1 diseases, with a result of 0 indicating that she makes it 
through the day without being exposed at all. For each disease she is 
exposed to, roll 1d8 and consult the following table to see what saving 
throws she must make to avoid becoming ill.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The last two diseases are unique to the Crawling Jungle. They, and two other hazards unique to this realm, are detailed below.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Boreworms:</b>
 Boreworms are actually a parasitic infection rather than a disease, but
 their effects are just as debilitating as any sickness. These 
microscopic parasites infest the roots and limbs of certain types of 
plants found in the Crawling Jungle, and they infest a living host when 
exposed skin brushes against them. Someone exposed to boreworms must 
make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or become infested with the parasites. 
Unless the victim is cured via magical means (such as a <i>remove disease</i>),
 he can be later infested if he continues to wear the same clothing and 
equipment he wore when he first came in contact with the infestation. 
Soaking infested equipment in alcohol or oil kills the boreworms. Once 
the infestation sets in, the boreworms begin burrowing through the 
victim's bones, leaving them brittle and fragile. Boreworms have an 
incubation period of 1d4 days and deal 1d4 points of temporary 
Constitution damage per day. As long as the boreworms remain in the 
victim's body, this ability damage is permanent.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Hatefrenzy:</b>
 Tiny biting flies that have fed upon the dead bodies of fiendish 
monsters spread this terrible disease. A character exposed to hatefrenzy
 must make a Fortitude save (DC 18) to avoid infection. This is a 
magical disease, and successful saves do not allow the character to 
recover. Only magical healing can save the character. Hatefrenzy has an 
incubation period of 1 day. When the disease sets in, it begins to eat 
away at portions of the victim's brain that govern personality and 
emotion, causing 1d6 points of temporary Charisma damage per day. A 
victim of hatefrenzy becomes more and more antagonistic and insane with 
anger, and she eventually collapses into a nightmare-filled coma. Worse,
 as long as someone is suffering Charisma damage from hatefrenzy, she 
loses the ability to discern friend from foe in combat. Those affected 
by this disease attack the closest target in combat and continue 
fighting until incapacitated or until no further targets are in sight.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Green Fog:</b>
 Magic green fog manifests sporadically in the Crawling Jungle in 
circular patches with a radius of 2d20 x 100 feet. The fog is thick and 
provides partial concealment (30% miss chance) to anything within it. It
 has additional effects on good- and evil-aligned creatures caught 
within it. Good creatures caught in green fog must make a Fortitude save
 (DC 15) each minute or suffer 1d4 points of temporary Strength damage 
as the fog seeps into the body and eats away at the victim's muscles. A 
creature with a 0 Strength score instead suffers 1d4 points of temporary
 Constitution damage on each failed saving throw. Evil creatures exposed
 to green fog are fortified by the evil mist and gain a +4 enhancement 
bonus to Strength and Constitution as long as they remain in the fog. A 
patch of green fog can be dispersed by strong winds and disperses 
naturally after 3d10 minutes.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Vile Foliage:</b>
 The vines, trees, and undergrowth of the Crawling Jungle consist 
entirely of unnatural plant life that has been corrupted by foul 
energies from the Abyss. To casual observation, these plants seem to be 
normal tropical plants, but close inspection reveals intricate networks 
of red veins in the trunks and leaves. While these plants gain some 
nourishment from photosynthesis, the bulk of their nutrients come from 
absorbing blood spilled on their roots. Most of the plants have no 
offensive capabilities; they must depend wholly on the violent nature of
 the jungle's inhabitants to provide blood. Nonetheless, they are 
capable of limited movement. All intruders in the Crawling Jungle are 
constantly poked, prodded, tripped, and menaced by writhing vines and 
grasping roots. This incurs a constant -2 circumstance penalty on all 
Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, and Reflex saving 
throws. Creatures native to the jungle are not hindered by the foliage; 
in fact, the plants part easily and willingly for all such creatures as 
if they possessed the woodland stride druid ability. Intruder druids 
with the woodland stride ability are still hindered by this foliage, 
since it is magical in nature. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Introducing Hazards of the Crawling Jungle to Your Campaign</span></b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 these hazards normally occur only in the Crawling Jungle, it's possible
 that displaced Cultists of the Ravenous Maw have developed spells or 
magic items that duplicate the effects temporarily. Perhaps one group of
 cultists have preserved and bottled green fog and use them like potions
 to enhance their Strength and Constitution for 1 minute intervals per 
dose. These hazards can also be incorporated easily into traps that 
protect lairs of such cultists.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An
 adventuring party recently returned from an expedition to the Crawling 
Jungle, but unknown to them they have all caught hatefrenzy. The disease
 quickly spreads through the area, causing riots. The PCs must track 
down the source of these riots and stop the plague before it destroys 
the city.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An
 NPC druid comes across a small patch of vile foliage that has 
mysteriously sprung up in her domain. Horrified by the plants, she tries
 to uproot them before they can spread and finds a strange sphere buried
 in the ground below the plants. Upon touching the sphere, she becomes 
possessed by the demonic spirit imprisoned in the sphere and quickly 
becomes a terrible menace to the surrounding environs.</span></li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Adventurers
 who find themselves in the Crawling Jungle for extended periods quickly
