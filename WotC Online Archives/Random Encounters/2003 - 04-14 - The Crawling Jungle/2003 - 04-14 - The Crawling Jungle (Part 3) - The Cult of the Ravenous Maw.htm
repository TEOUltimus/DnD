<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:15px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" color:#CC0000;">The Cult of the Ravenous Maw</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><img src="2003%20-%2004-14%20-%20The%20Crawling%20Jungle%20%28Part%203%29%20-%20The%20Cult%20of%20the%20Ravenous%20Maw_files/DnD_AprilRE_3_v3ige3.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="249" width="177">The
 foul Cult of the Ravenous Maw is based in the stinking depths of the 
Crawling Jungle. New cultists are often indoctrinated into the ranks 
when the jungle wakens and manifests after its hundred-year dormancy; 
those creatures that don't flee in terror or aren't quickly slain by the
 jungle's dangers often become enthralled by the jungle's evil beauty. 
These cultists can be of any race, but they are most often elves since 
the Crawling Jungle seems to have a strange predisposition to manifest 
near or in elven lands. As part of their indoctrination to the cult, 
these new cultists are brought before the Ravenous Maw, where the fell 
energies of the N'gharl Seed infuse them with fiendish power (as 
detailed in Part 4 of The Crawling Jungle).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 cult typically takes only a few months to reach stability once the 
Crawling Jungle manifests. The cult itself is nomadic, since the jungle 
itself moves as the Ravenous Maw wanders the landscape, but the cult 
leaders tend to stay near the center of the jungle. All cult members 
have at least one druid level; none of them are clerics. All druids of 
the Ravenous Maw take the Tainted Druid feat as soon as they can since 
they have little access to normal animals in the Crawling Jungle to 
befriend with the <i>animal friendship</i> spell. Indeed, most normal animals wouldn't last long in the Crawling Jungle.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 cult typically organizes into one of four types of groups. Hunting 
parties provide food for the rest of the cultists, and patrols scour the
 jungle for any sign of intrusion from beyond its borders. Slave 
caravans are the only groups found outside of the jungle, since they 
stage raids on nearby towns and roads so they can kidnap more slaves 
(who generally have only short periods of servitude before they are 
sacrificed to the Ravenous Maw). A fourth type of group is the warband 
(an extra large patrol led by a cult high priest). These large groups 
are typically mobilized only if the cult determines a powerful enemy 
force has invaded the Crawling Jungle.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Typical Ravenous Maw Cultist Groups</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Hunting Party:</b> 4 acolytes, 1 marauder.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Patrol:</b> 4 marauders.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Slave Caravan:</b> 3 marauders, 1 priest, 3d6 slaves (usually 1st-level commoner humans).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Warband:</b> 6 marauders, 2 priests, 1 high priest.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Acolyte:</b>
 Druids of the Ravenous Maw are considered acolytes until they master 
the cult's traditional fighting style: dual-wielding a pair of sickles 
in combat in homage to their Ravenous lord. Mastering this style 
requires two of the following feats: Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting 
Style, or Weapon Focus (sickle). Since most of these druids have Tainted
 Druid as their 1st-level feat, they usually remain acolytes until 6th 
level. Those who have a few fighter levels (for bonus feats) or a ranger
 level find that, unless they have druid, fighter, or ranger as a 
favored class, their progress in the cult hierarchy quickly becomes 
stunted.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Marauder:</b>
 Some druids have little interest in achieving the rank of cult priest 
and would rather wallow in the savagery of combat and the hunt. These 
cultists are known as marauders and are multiclass barbarian/druids. 
Once they gain the ability to <i>wild shape</i>, they prefer to spend as much time as possible in various <i>wild shape</i>
 forms, combining their barbarian rage ability with the powerful natural
 attacks of their new form with devastating effect. Marauders serve as 
the guardians and warriors for the cult.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Priest:</b>
 Once an acolyte of the cult masters the cult's fighting style, she 
becomes a priest of the cult. Priests generally remain near the core of 
the Crawling Jungle so that they can better serve the high priests and 
the Ravenous Lord. They do accompany slave caravans and warbands as 
needed, but otherwise are only rarely found in the outer reaches of the 
jungle. Priests of the Crawling Jungle are expected to take at least two
 item creation feats as they gain levels; those who do not gain the 
ability to craft various magic items are quickly shunned, 
excommunicated, and eaten.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>High Priest:</b>
 Traditionally, only five high priests are active at any one time in the
 Crawling Jungle. The cult has no official ruling that keeps this number
 to five, but infighting and sabotage tend to keep the number to a 
healthy minimum. To achieve the rank of high priest, a priest must first
 gain at least two item creation feats in addition to all three of the 
cult's favored combat feats (Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting, and 
Weapon Focus [sickle]). To prove her might, a high priest-to-be must 
personally cast the <i>awaken</i> spell on no less than three creatures native to the Crawling Jungle and must also be able to assume <i>wild shape</i> forms of at least Huge size. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Tainted Druid [General]</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Your druidic powers are tainted by fiendish influences.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Prerequisite: </b>You
 must forsake all that is good and peaceful in the natural world. 
Typically, this means you must be an outsider with the Evil subtype, 
possess the Fiendish template, or be undead. Other unique qualifiers 
could apply, based on the DM's discretion.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Benefit:</b>
 All of your spells and abilities that normally apply to animals now 
apply only to animals, vermin, or beasts that have the fiendish 
template. You can gain a fiendish animal/beast companion with the <i>animal friendship</i> spell (but not fiendish vermin, since they are immune to mind-affecting magic), can summon fiendish animals/beasts/vermin with <i>summon nature's ally</i> spells, can <i>awaken</i> fiendish animals/beasts/vermin, and can increase the size of fiendish animals/beasts/vermin with the <i>animal growth</i> spell. You can also assume the form of a fiendish animal/beast/vermin with <i>wild shape,</i> although this feat does not allow you to gain any of the new form's supernatural abilities.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Introducing the Cult of the Ravenous Maw to Your Campaign</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 N'gharl Seed manifests somewhere in the world, and the surviving 
Cultists of the Ravenous Maw sense its return and awaken. The PCs might 
encounter one of these groups of cultists while on the road, or perhaps a
 group of them passes through a village the PCs are staying in and they 
start causing trouble.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 party is called upon to protect a frontier town that has been attacked 
several times by a particularly violent and disturbing tribe of 
barbarians. These barbarians are led by several marauder cultists of the
 Ravenous Maw who survived the latest banishing of the Crawling Jungle, 
and they have turned their attention to building up a horde of minions 
while they await the return of their lord.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Tainted Druid feat could be used by any strange or sinister sect of 
druids in your world. Perhaps a wood that is rumored to be haunted is in
 fact the lair of a night hag druid who has the Tainted Druid feat and 
is attended by fiendish dire animals. The night hag may be searching for
 a way to transform all of the animal life in her wood into fiendish 
animals, just to make a home away from home.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cultists
 of the Ravenous Maw are certainly the most common foe adventurers 
encounter as they explore the Crawling Jungle. Perhaps the PCs run into 
some cultists after they've already been weakened by disease.</span></p>
