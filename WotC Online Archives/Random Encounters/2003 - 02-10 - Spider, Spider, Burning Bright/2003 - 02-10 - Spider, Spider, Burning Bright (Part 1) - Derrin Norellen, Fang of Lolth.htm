<p class="size2"><b>Derrin Norellen, Fang of Lolth </b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2002-10%20-%20Spider,%20Spider,%20Burning%20Bright%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Derrin%20Norellen,%20Fang%20of%20Lolth_files/re_jan03_001.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="196" width="166">Many
 are the traps laid by the Spider Queen. Her web is subtle, and it is 
immense. She has snared innumerable souls within her cunning plots. 
Countless others have fallen victim to her curses, trading their 
humanity for the power that Lolth seems to offer. Only when it is too 
late do they discover that the Spider Queen does not trade fairly, and 
that she will demand everything from a mortal in the end.</p>
<p class="size2">Derrin Norellen, drow rogue and illustrious adventurer,
 once believed himself beyond the clutches of any trap. For years he 
adventured in the most dangerous realms, encountering pits of lava, 
poisoned darts, and collapsing walls and always emerging unscathed. It 
was not until he found the curious gem with odd magical properties that 
his luck began to change.</p>
<p class="size2">It was a treasure horde like any other, recovered from 
the lair of a drow priestess and her cohorts. (He had no problems 
stealing from his fellow drow since he had renounced them long ago as a 
child.) Among the typical scrolls, coins, and potions, Derrin found a 
strange jewel. The party's wizard said it was certainly magic. The 
party's cleric told him to leave it be. Never one to err on the side of 
caution, Derrin ignored the cleric and set about trying to make the 
jewel function. After much guesswork and many failed attempts -- some of
 them spectacular and pyrotechnic -- he succeeded. The jewel grafted 
itself to his neck and refused to be removed no matter how much force he
 applied to it. His canine teeth began to grow larger and coarse hair 
began to grow on his neck.</p>
<p class="size2">At first, these were the gem's only effects. Derrin 
learned to wear shirts with high collars and smile infrequently, all the
 while wishing he'd paid more attention to the cleric's guidance. Then 
the other changes began. In the beginning, they were simple: He felt 
stronger and faster, and he began to have a better intuitive grasp of 
magic. Then his teeth changed, becoming razor sharp -- so sharp that he 
would often cut his lips on them. Then during a heated street battle, 
Derrin's jaw opened three times wider than it should have and he took a 
bloody chunk out of one of the thugs that was assaulting him. The other 
thugs beat a hasty retreat, leaving Derrin alone in the shadows.</p>
<p class="size2">It was all downhill from there.</p>
<p class="size2">Derrin fell victim to a <i>fang scarab</i>, which is a 
magic gem that the drow create to bolster a spider's combat prowess. By 
tricking it into working, Derrin caused the gem to treat him as if he 
were a spider. Unfortunately, besides granting him enhanced abilities 
and senses, the gem also began to transform him into an abominable 
spider-human hybrid. Far less than human now, Derrin is a pitiable 
mockery of the person he once was. He now exists to serve Lolth and 
lives like the vermin he has become. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Introducing Derrin Norellen to Your Campaign </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Children who play near the entrance to an old, abandoned mine have 
begun to disappear. Parents keep their young ones indoors now. The 
bereaved families of those who have been lost beg the PCs to search for 
their missing children. They have been snatched by Derrin, who is 
holding them prisoner with the idea of sacrificing them to Lolth in the 
hope of ending his curse. If the PCs do not hurry, the children are 
doomed.<br><br></li>
<li>A strange spider stalks the city at night. Many murders and 
robberies are being blamed on it. The PCs are called upon to 
investigate. The murderer and thief is Derrin, who is taking advantage 
of his extraordinary abilities to make quick money. If he notices the 
PCs are trying to track him down, he immediately attempts to hide in the
 Underdark and lay low until interest has passed.<br><br></li>
<li>Derrin, struggling with his curse and attempting to resist the 
constant whispers of Lolth, contacts one of the PCs in the hope that 
they can "cure" him. He finally accepts that his transformation is 
completely out of hand and that he needs powerful help if he is ever to 
regain his humanity. Since there is no known way to "cure" Derrin short 
of removing the fang scarab, and thus killing him, this could present a 
problem for the PCs -- especially since Derrin is interested in staying 
alive even more than he is interested in finding a "cure." Meanwhile, 
Derrin -- who has never had a lot of willpower -- must continue to 
resist the voice of Lolth, which encourages him to betray the PCs is 
most horrible ways imaginable.</li>

<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day -- <i>dancing lights, darkness, faerie fire. </i>Caster level 17th; save DC 12 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spider Bite:</b> Derrin can unhinge his jaw and bite
 as a natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. This attack does 
not provoke an attack of opportunity from foes. If he uses a full attack
 action, he can make normal weapon attacks and use his bite as a 
secondary natural attack at the standard -5 penalty.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Summon Swarm</i> (Sp): </b>Three times a day, Derrin can summon and direct an army of normal spiders to do his bidding. This ability works exactly like a <i>summon swarm</i>
 spell cast by a 10th-level druid, except that the swarm is always 
composed of spiders. Derrin can spend a move-equivalent action to direct
 the swarm, which moves at a speed of 30 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Drow Traits: </b>Derrin is immune to magic <i>sleep</i>
 spells and effects. He has a +2 racial bonus on saves against 
enchantment spells or effects and a +2 racial bonus on Will saves 
against spells or spell-like abilities. Derrin is entitled to a Search 
check when within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door as though 
actively looking for it. As a drow, he also has light blindness (blinded
 for 1 round by abrupt exposure to bright light, -1 circumstance penalty
 on all attack rolls, saves, and checks while operating in bright 
light). He also has a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search checks
 (already figured into the statistics given above).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If exposed to any effect that 
normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, Derrin takes no damage with a successful saving throw.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spider Limbs (Ex):</b> Derrin has two pairs of extra
 limbs, which emerge from the sides of his torso when needed and are 
fully retractable. Extending or retracting the spider limbs is a 
move-equivalent action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. 
The legs are tipped with simple claws that can hold weapons and other 
items normally, though they are incapable of the fine manipulation 
required for spellcasting or using Dexterity-based skills such as Open 
Lock and Pick Pocket. Despite his extra limbs, Derrin is still limited 
to one standard action per round. He can, however, make a secondary 
natural attack with each clawed leg at the standard -5 penalty as part 
of a full attack action. His claws deal 1d4 points of damage. If Derrin 
devotes two of his spider legs entirely to locomotion, his land and 
climb speeds each increase by 20 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spider Vision (Ex): </b>Derrin possesses increased 
visual acuity in the form of a +4 competence bonus on both Spot and 
Search checks (already figured into the statistics noted above).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Vermin Traits: </b>Derrin is immune to all mind-affecting effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Physical Changes:</b> Derrin cannot hide his 
arachnoid nature without magical assistance. He is covered with insect 
chitin, his back hunches, his eyes are multifaceted, his skin is dark 
and covered with tufts of coarse, black hair, his limbs, fingers, and 
toes are unnaturally long, and he only has four digits on each foot and 
hand.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i> sap, <i>+3 rapier of wounding,</i><i>fang scarab, cloak of arachnida, bag of holding (bag 4), ioun stone (dark blue rhomboid).</i></p>
<p class="size2">(The Fang of Lolth prestige class comes from the <i>Song and Silence</i> sourcebook.)</p>
