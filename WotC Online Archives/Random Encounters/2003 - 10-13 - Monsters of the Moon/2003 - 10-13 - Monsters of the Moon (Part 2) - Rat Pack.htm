<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Rat Pack</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2010-13%20-%20Monsters%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Part%202%29%20-%20Rat%20Pack_files/RE_OCT03_2_128gs90.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="323" width="226">The
 village of Dark Stone has, like any other town out in the wilderness, a
 rat problem. It has never been too bad -- certainly not bad enough to 
send someone for help -- but it is there. Residents have to be careful 
not to leave food out at night and be vigilant about keeping a good 
mouser cat on hand.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Unknown
 to the villagers, a pack of moonrats moved in to Dark Stone to join 
their feral companions. Last month, during the full moon, the lunar 
light swelled their intellects and they became aware that Dark Stone had
 gotten complacent about the rat problem. It was almost bad enough for 
the humanoids to make a concentrated effort but not quite yet. This was 
the window of opportunity the moonrats lived for. Before the night was 
over, they had made their plans. At the next full moon, they would 
strike from surprise and, with their numbers, bring the village down and
 feast on the juicy treasures that would be theirs.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At
 the next full moon, the moonrats' Intelligence scores will swell to 10.
 Fortunately for them, the night of the next full moon is like the three
 nights previous: crystal clear with no clouds.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">During
 the nights leading up to the full moon, the moonrats have been 
preparing for their night of horror. Nibbling part way through ropes, 
almost breaching walls down by the floor, digging tunnels from building 
to building, stealing small objects -- everything necessary for them to 
put their plan into action.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Moon Rats:</b> hp 1; see <i>Monster Manual II</i> page 151.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Plan</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 goal for the moonrats is simple: destruction. While other packs of 
moonrats seek to spread only terror and disease, this pack is led by He 
Who Pierces, a moonrat with exceptionally sharp teeth and the 
determination and charisma to lead the pack. His plan is to destroy as 
much of Dark Stone as possible in a single night, and then after that he
 intends to menace the humanoids when they are most vulnerable and 
without shelter.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 primary means for the destruction is going to be fire. Every lantern 
sitting on every table in Dark Stone is going to be overturned and the 
oil set aflame.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Execution</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs may be staying overnight in Dark Stone for any number of reasons. 
Perhaps they're recuperating from a difficult battle earlier in the day,
 or perhaps they're just passing through and needed a rest at the local 
inn. Either way, the quiet night is broken by multiple -- and 
simultaneous -- cries of "Fire!"</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He
 Who Pierces' plan begins smoothly. With all the rats in place and 
attacking at the same time, thwarting the destruction of the village is 
going to be extremely difficult. The only way to do it is for everyone 
to realize that the rats are suddenly intelligent and working against 
the villagers.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Coming
 to this realization may be easy. It takes a successful Spot check (DC 
15) to note that some of the rats are clearly communicating with each 
other almost like humanoids do. They even gesticulate in an intelligent 
way. Additionally, many are carrying things in their mouths and acting 
in a manner unusual for instinct-driven rats. The people most likely to 
notice this are the adventurers, since the villagers are quite 
preoccupied with saving their homes and buildings from fire.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another
 instance that can provide PCs with a clue as to what they're dealing 
with involves the temple. First of all, it's not on fire, and, secondly,
 the roof seems to be moving. A successful Spot check (DC 15) shows that
 the roof is nearly carpeted with rats, and dozens of rats are streaming
 up and down its walls.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs may want to help with the fires, but they may not have the ability 
to do so. (The fires the rats start are by necessity, fairly small, and 
the PCs can easily put them out. However, more fires and other 
destructive events keep happening until the PCs deal with the rats. </span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#ff0000">) </span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As a result, their best option is to concentrate on the rats -- and on He Who Pierces if they can.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once
 the PCs realize that the rats are coordinated, they may come to the 
conclusion that a rat should be leading the assault on Dark Stone. (If 
not, a successful Wilderness Lore check (DC 10) can point this out to 
them.) Thus, He Who Pierces becomes the most wanted rat in the village.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finding
 He Who Pierces can be accomplished only by capturing and interrogating a
 moonrat since He Who Pierces does not distinguish himself in any way 
that a nonrat would recognize. The rats are loyal to whoever is in 
charge and won't give up information easily. How the PCs extract He Who 
Pierces' whereabouts is up to the PCs.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">He
 Who Pierces is hiding out atop the tallest structure in Dark Stone: the
 temple. This may be obvious from the situation, but discovering which 
rat in that teaming mass is He Who Pierces is another matter. From atop 
the temple, He Who Pierces can see the village easily and issue orders 
to runners to try to counter the efforts of the humanoids.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Battle</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fighting
 He Who Pierces may be difficult because of its location on the roof of 
the temple. A successful Climb check (DC 20) is needed to ascend to He 
Who Pierces' level. Anyone who appears on the roof of the temple is 
swarmed by 2d10 moonrats. Since the rats are intelligent, they try to 
coordinate their attacks to maximum effect. If possible, they try to 
trip humanoids off the roof. If not, they bite, claw, and tear the 
humanoid down.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Destructive
 area spells are not welcome given the nature of the building. Aside 
from risking the wrath of the god whose temple it is, there is the 
practical matter that with so many buildings on fire, an intact building
 capable of holding many people at once is going to be a critical 
building in Dark Stone's recovery. It has to remain standing and avoid 
as much damage as possible.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 the PCs kill He Who Pierces, the resolve of the moonrats wavers and 
they become uncoordinated, though they are still intelligent. This can 
be the turning point that allows the villagers to get the upper hand on 
the destruction of their village.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bringing the Parts Together</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 random encounter can be used any time the PCs visit a village or town 
anywhere. Moonrats are essentially invisible foes, since they're rarely 
taken too seriously. They're free to scuttle about carrying out their 
twisted plans in plain sight, shielded by the impression that rats 
aren't intelligent or clever enough to amount to anything.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However,
 a good time to introduce this threat is the night after the battle in 
the previous random encounter, while the PCs are recovering.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Coming in Part 3 of Monsters of the Moon</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 results of unending stress take many forms. See what can happen in a 
community besieged by ongoing stressful occurrences, and then see what 
creature takes advantage of the situation.</span></p>
