<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2010-13%20-%20Monsters%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Moon%20Stalker_files/RE_OCT03_1_haxiq.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="295" width="239">This
 encounter takes place in the village of Dark Stone. There are no 
statistics in particular for Dark Stone, since it is meant to be little 
more than a setting for this (and other) random encounters. Feel free to
 substitute names and other material as appropriate for your campaign.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 mooncalf is an evil malevolence that has three characteristics that 
make it particularly threatening: extreme intelligence, spell-like 
abilities, and the ability to communicate with any creature. It's a 
significant threat when directly encountered, which is not often. The 
mooncalf prefers to direct its efforts toward its grand designs, letting
 minions and allies do its fighting for it. Since it finds intelligent 
humanoids untrustworthy, it generally prefers to use other creatures to 
do this dirty work. It can dominate animals with its spell-like ability 
or find a way to convince other kinds of creatures using its intellect.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Mooncalf: </b>hp 190; see <i>Monster Manual II</i> page 150.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 mooncalf has come to Dark Stone for a purpose. In its cold lair, it 
developed a lust for magic items, and it knows the best place to get 
them would be a group of adventurers. The mooncalf knows that 
adventurers are most often lured by the promise of riches. The mooncalf 
has none it is willing to give up, so it must use another tactic. The 
mooncalf also knows that adventurers are lured by sob stories of 
humanoids in peril. To that end, the mooncalf is going to cause a bit of
 mayhem using a powerful monster that will cause enough damage to lure 
even cynical adventurers to Dark Stone.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dark
 Stone is a simple village with not more than a dozen homes and 
buildings. However, it does have one claim to fame: a small outdoor 
amphitheater. It was built a few generations ago through the largesse of
 a visiting bard adventurer and is now principally used for town 
meetings and seasonal festivals. It's rarely used for performances since
 the village is too small to support a strong enough community theater 
to take advantage of the facility. Perhaps the most frequent users are 
traveling bards.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 season, the townsfolk plan to decorate the amphitheater with orange and
 black ribbons to match the turning of the leaves and the approaching 
darkness of winter. Before they have a chance, the mooncalf sets loose a
 monster in their midst: a dune stalker that the mooncalf has recruited.
 The carnage the dune stalker causes is more than enough for word to 
spread about a monster that needs to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Stalking the Stalker</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 adventurers may be brought into the situation by stumbling upon the 
village or hearing about the monster on the loose and deciding to go to 
Dark Stone on purpose. Either way, finding the dune stalker is not 
difficult -- the mooncalf wants it to be found.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Dune Stalker:</b> hp 39; see <i>Monster Manual II</i> page 88.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 the dune stalker walks, its massive front arms drag on the ground, 
leaving a distinctive track that's quite unlike any other animal. For 
this reason, a successful Track check (DC 10) is all that's required to 
follow the dune stalker through the wilderness. The dune stalker is an 
excellent tracker itself, and thus it knows how to leave a good trail 
but not one so obvious that it looks purposefully laid down. However, 
it's still possible to spot the deception. A successful Track check (DC 
28) will note that the tracks have been deliberately -- and very 
cleverly -- left by the dune stalker to be discovered.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 mooncalf has ordered the stalker to hole up in a cave near the village.
 The mooncalf's plan is to have the adventurers approach the mouth of 
the cave and be ambushed by the dune stalker who is hiding nearby. (The 
mooncalf lifted the dune stalker and placed it nearby, so the dune 
stalker wouldn't leave any tracks going to its hiding place.) When the 
battle is under way, the mooncalf plans to fly onto the scene and 
assault the adventurers with its magic and tentacles as appropriate. It 
attempts to strike the adventurers when they're outside so it can have 
maximum use of its <i>control weather</i> and <i>call lightning</i> abilities.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Since
 the mooncalf can communicate with the dune stalker telepathically, the 
mooncalf can help coordinate the attack. Therefore, the Dungeon Master 
may wish to allow the mooncalf to aid the dune stalker with Spot and 
Listen checks at the beginning of the encounter if the situation calls 
for it (such as if the mooncalf is lurking nearby). If the attack goes 
poorly, the mooncalf flies away, perhaps to the dark side of the moon, 
leaving the dune stalker to its fate. Either way, the mooncalf has the 
last laugh, because the battle takes place far from its lair and dune 
stalkers eschew material goods. Nevertheless, if the adventurers are 
successful, they have helped the village of Dark Stone. The citizenry 
are likely to ask them to stay while they recuperate. . . .</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bringing the Parts Together</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 village of Dark Stone is a simple cluster of houses that can exist 
easily on any campaign world. Every adventuring group passes through a 
village at least a little like this one and so these encounters can be 
tied together by having the PCs visit, and remain, in the village for 
other encounters, or have the encounters occur in the next place the 
adventurers visit. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Coming in Part 2 of Monster of the Moon</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 the moon rises over Dark Stone, the villagers will realize they don't 
have a rat problem -- the rats have a people problem. </span></p>
