<p align="LEFT"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#CC0000;">Green Death</span></b></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2003-17%20-%20Denizens%20of%20Stone%20Bog%20%28Part%204%29%20-%20Green%20Death_files/green_dragon_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="267" width="308">Not
 far from the watery lair of the mummies stands the remnants of a 
shattered guard tower whose weed-choked moat has overflowed over the 
surrounding area for several hundred yards in every direction. The moat 
itself is about 12 feet deep, but the surrounding wetland is barely 
ankle deep.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 green dragon Wrinestii makes her lair in the tower. She usually comes 
and goes through a hole in the battlements, but there also is a crack in
 the foundation that gives access to the moat, and Wrinestii can wiggle 
through that if she likes. The tower's gutted interior consists of a 
single, high chamber, with a ceiling mostly intact except for 
Wrinestii's exit hole. Piles of masonry debris litter the floor. The 
dragon has dug out a shallow bowl to contain her treasure (and serve as 
her bed). A sinkhole leading to the tower's flooded dungeons (with their
 connection to the moat) completes the scene.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wrinestii
 is the sole survivor of a green dragon family wiped out by elves. 
Though exceptionally vigorous and agile for a member of her species, 
Wrinestii's wits were always a tad slow, much to the delight of her 
nestmates (who teased her unceasingly) and the despair of her parents. 
When the elves discovered and attacked the family lair, Wrinestii fled 
at the first sign of danger. Later, she returned to the scene, where she
 ambushed a few elves left to guard the lair and steal a portion of her 
family's treasure. Though pleased with herself for surviving her 
family's demise, she remains resentful of all elves and very sensitive 
about her mental prowess and personal courage. She's a bully and a 
coward through and through, but she resents anyone saying so.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wrinestii
 considers herself the undisputed ruler of Stone Bog, and the other 
residents are mostly content to let her think so. She aggressively 
defends her tower and the whole of Stone Bog if she becomes aware of 
intruders in the area. Whenever possible, Wrinestii meets her foes 
outside her lair. She prefers to open a battle using Flyby Attack and 
her breath weapon, then she vanishes behind the trees or underwater, 
where she casts <i>shield</i> on herself and waits until she can breathe again, whereupon she returns for another Flyby breath attack. After that, she casts <i>true strike,</i>
 then flies in for a diving attack on the enemy's most imposing fighter.
 She uses her Power Attack feat to turn all her base attack bonus (+14) 
into a damage bonus. After delivering this (she hopes) devastating 
attack, she demands that her foes surrender.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Should
 her foes actually surrender, Wrinestii is pleasantly surprised, and she
 quickly demands that they place all their weapons, magic, and money in a
 pile. (She uses her <i>detect magic</i> spell to make sure nobody 
withholds any magic.) Once that's done, she flies off with as much loot 
as she can carry, laughing like a maniac. Foes who have surrendered 
would do well to quit the area while the dragon is gone, because it 
eventually will occur to Wrinestii that anyone who escapes the fight 
will return to attack her another day.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Should
 Wrinestii's foes choose to fight on after her demand for surrender, the
 dragon fights on the ground for a round or two, just long enough to get
 in one or two full attacks. She uses her breath weapon whenever it 
becomes available, blanketing the opposition from aloft. During a long 
battle, she may retreat once or twice to repeat her <i>true strike</i> 
and Power Attack tactic, especially if she has to wait a long time 
between breaths. She intends to fight to the death, but if reduced to 15
 hit points or less, she flees the bog, returning only after she has 
regained all her lost hit points and spells. If she finds her lair 
looted when she gets back, she'll be in a dark mood indeed, but sets out
 to rebuild her hoard as best she can.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 unable to flee a battle that has turned against her, Wrinestii might be
 persuaded to surrender herself (this requires a successful Diplomacy or
 Intimidate check, with at least a +10 to Wrinestii's Sense Motive 
check). Groups who capture Wrinestii would do well to seize a portion of
 the defeated dragon's horde and leave. Anyone who tries to take 
Wrinestii prisoner mostly likely will have to fight her again someday. 
Wrinestii is a coward, but she remains on the lookout for any 
opportunity to slay her captors and escape.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wrinestii
 makes regular trips around Stone Bog to keep her eye on things, but she
 seldom strays far from her tower lair. Her attempts to establish 
herself as queen of the bog have met only mixed results. Of all the 
denizens of the bog, only the gargoyles (see The Gargoyles of Stone Bog,
 part 1) pay her much attention. They resent her attempts to command 
them, but reluctantly do her bidding when they cannot evade her. Still, 
the gargoyles are quick to report any incursions into the bog to 
Wrinestii, especially if a party has defeated them in combat.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ghouls in the dell (see Beware the Ghouls, part 2) would love to sink 
their teeth and claws into the dragon's flesh (a testament to how hungry
 they have become). They usually hide when the dragon flies overhead, 
and they allow the dragon to carry off any baubles left behind when the 
ghouls slay visitors to the dell.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 mummies ignore the dragon, and for the most part she ignores them. 
Still, if Wrinestii is at home when a battle occurs near the mummies' 
lair, the dragon is likely to hear the ruckus and come to investigate. 
She usually waits until any battle with the mummies is over before 
joining the fray herself, though she may intervene if a party drives all
 the mummies back into the water through undead turning. Should the 
turned mummies reappear, Wrinestii withdraws to recharge her breath 
weapon or cast a <i>true strike</i> spell (or both), and returns when the mummies have been defeated or driven off again.</span></p>
