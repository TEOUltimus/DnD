<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Caveat Emptor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2011-10%20-%20The%20Itinerant%20Bazaar%20%28Part%204%29%20-%20Caveat%20Emptor_files/RE41103_sd92.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="122" width="144">The
 Itinerant Bazaar would hardly deserve its name if the only vendors were
 the three permanent members. The proprietors hand pick particular 
vendors to go to each stop the bazaar makes. Their criteria include the 
temperament of the merchant, local demand for the merchandise, and the 
size of the Market Day they are attending. It is important to the 
proprietors that the number of merchants associated with the bazaar 
never outnumbers the local vendors, and that the two groups never go 
head-to-head selling the same materials. They want visits from the 
bazaar to be remembered as positive events, even by the local 
"competition."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Presented below are a handful of vendors that can often 
be found at the Itinerant Bazaar. They are not permanently attached to 
the bazaar like those described previously, but they are merchants with 
whom the proprietors have longstanding business relationships. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The bazaar should not be limited to these choices, 
though. The DM can add in any booth selling any merchandise or service 
that she likes. Everything from rare books to fortunetelling to divine 
healing -- if there's something people will pay for, the bazaar may have
 a vendor willing to sell it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blades of Renown</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In just about any place the bazaar visits where weapons 
sales are not restricted, you will find Sam McLintough's stall. A 
middle-aged human, Sam is not a weaponsmith, but he does sell an 
inventory of most martial weapons and quite a few exotic ones as well. 
What's more, he carries only weapons that are enhanced in one way or 
another (most have only +1 enhancements, but others are special or even 
unique items). Some of the weapons are, in fact, from the arsenal he 
carried in his youth. Sam was a mercenary for many years before losing 
his left eye and right hand in a skirmish that meant nothing more to him
 than the few hundred gold pieces he'd been paid. Still, he thinks he's 
lucky to have survived, and rather than seeking a magical way to restore
 himself, he decided to retire and become an arms merchant. Every weapon
 he sells comes with a tale of pain and death -- Sam's odd way of 
discouraging violence while selling the instruments that deal it out. He
 does not make the weapons himself. He buys them used, often from 
scavengers who took them from the corpses of fallen warriors, and he 
insists on hearing as much about the item's history before he buys the 
item. Often, if the weapon has no history, Sam does not seek to add it 
to his inventory. (Most items follow the prices listed in the Player's 
Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide, but if DMs want to attach an 
unknown flaw to the weapon or have it be sought out by a persistent 
former owner who wants the item back, these situations could bring the 
price down a bit at the DM's discretion.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fhildul's Home Brews</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Fhildul is a human barbarian whose family served as the 
shamans and healers for his tribe. However, when he was very young, a 
plague wiped out all but a few members of the tribe, including all the 
other members of his family. Left to his own devices, Fhildul traveled 
the world, and eventually the planes, looking for a place to fit in. He 
finally found it with the Itinerant Bazaar. He maintains a very simple 
stall from which he sells potions, poultices, alchemical mixtures, and 
barbarian charms. Sadly, because his parents died before they could 
teach him the family trade completely, Fhildul's products are not always
 as potent or effective as they ought to be, so he sells them for 15% 
below the usual market price. Whenever someone uses one of his products 
there is a 20% chance that it will fail to have any effect, and a 5% 
chance that it will do 1 point of temporary Constitution damage to the 
person using it instead of doing what Fhildul stated it would do. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Peacock Quills</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This stall takes its name not only from the wares, but 
the proprietor as well. Imon Peacock has a passion for all writing 
instruments, including inks, pigments, and various papers and canvases. 
His booth is lined with tubes containing parchment, rice paper, vellum, 
papyrus, and just about every other kind of writing surface known. He 
also has a large selection of journals and diaries, bound in everything 
from simple cloth to leather to intricately woven designs of stone and 
bones. He has even mastered the art of making volumes that are suitable 
for use as spellbooks, and they are much sought after by wizards who can
 afford such artistry. But the heart of the stall is a cabinet that 
remains inside the wagon -- a cabinet that is covered with dozens of 
slim drawers. In each drawer rests a single pen, quill, or other writing
 implement. Some are plain and made of simple wood, while others are 
ostentatious with swooping feathers covered with a rainbow of colors and
 inlaid with gold and precious jewels. Imon can speak at great length 
about the process used to make each quill. He also makes a very flowery 
speech saying that the pen one uses to write with often says more about 
the person than the words written.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Perhaps more interestingly, he has a theory that you can
 tell a great deal about a person by the quill he or she uses, and 
claims that he can tell you a great deal about a person simply by 
looking at a one-page sample of handwriting. If asked to demonstrate, he
 can always tell what sort of pen or quill was used to write the page, 
the origin of the ink used, and the date the paper was made. 
Furthermore, he can determine with 80% accuracy the following 
information: age, gender, race, native language, geographical location 
at the time of the writing, and the relationship between the author and 
the intended reader. (He has many ranks in Spot, Knowledge (geography), 
Craft (papermaking), and Profession (scribe).)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>All Things Precious</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">At first this might seem like a simple moneychanger's 
stall and, indeed, that is one of the services that Haypenny Foster 
performs, but it is not his sole business. In fact, because many Market 
Days already have one or more local moneychangers, the young halfling 
proprietor will often refuse to perform those duties, despite the fact 
that he knows he could certainly provide a more accurate assessment than
 the local shysters. Still, he makes a living providing his expert 
appraisal services for a flat fee and through buying and selling gems, 
jewelry, and small art objects.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One wonders how he makes money if his appraisal skill is
 so keen, his morals are so impeccable, and his deals are so fair. The 
answer is that unlike others, he is a global trader. He knows that 
different cultures place different values on objects. And since the 
Itinerant Bazaar travels to more different cultures than most people 
have heard of, Haypenny can buy an item at a fair price in one culture, 
then sell it at a fair price in a culture (perhaps half a world away) 
that values it more. He always arrives in town with a great number of 
gems and precious metals that the locals will value, and he usually 
leaves with a wagon full of what they consider practically useless.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As an example of how this might work, the bazaar 
recently visited a Market Day in the frozen north lands. The land there 
is rich in copper ore, and they use the metal in their coins, jewelry, 
and living utensils. On the other hand, the weather is too harsh for 
them to tend anything but small herds of goats with very coarse wool. 
Haypenny brought with him bundles of spun lamb's wool and a few rolls of
 cotton cloth. He sold all this and practically filled his wagon with 
copper in various forms. Three days later, the bazaar visited a town 
with a magic college that utilized copper wiring, tubing, and mesh 
constantly in their labs. They didn't have any particular material 
Haypenny could use, but he eventually let them convince him to simply 
take gold coins.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Caveat Emptor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">At the Itinerant Bazaar, the buyer should most 
definitely beware. The vendors and their wares come from all over the 
world -- indeed, all over the planes -- and they know they will be gone 
long before a customer can return to register a complaint or ask for a 
refund. This is not to say that the goods are fraudulent. The 
proprietors are careful to make sure that the vendors are as honest as 
possible with customers about the capabilities and qualities of their 
merchandise. However, they will sometimes omit a fact or two in the 
pursuit of making a sale.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, all of the weapons sold at Blades of Renown
 have the magical enhancements and qualities Sam McLintough claims. 
However, they sometimes have other qualities (such as curses, or even 
sentience) that he fails to mention. He also gets his stock from 
less-than-scrupulous sources, and some may have been stolen from owners 
who are scouring the planes looking for their missing weapons (and 
hoping to take some revenge on the thieves).</p>
<p align="LEFT">As in any marketplace, the characters should remember 
that any item that costs less gold than it should will generally have 
some other price attached to it. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">With more stores to work with, DMs may find that they 
can use the bazaar, the proprietors, the rules, and the stores in 
several ways. It may be best to have the Itinerant Bazaar serve as a 
place to introduce an item to the PCs, or perhaps the PCs have to locate
 a specific item for someone, and one of the merchants at the bazaar has
 the item they seek (but, of course, isn't easy to find).</p>
