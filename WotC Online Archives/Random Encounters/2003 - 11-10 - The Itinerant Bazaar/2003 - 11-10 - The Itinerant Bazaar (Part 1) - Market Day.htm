<p align="left"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#CC0000;">Market Day</span></b></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2011-10%20-%20The%20Itinerant%20Bazaar%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Market%20Day_files/RE11103_cs98c.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="199" width="177">Sometimes
 the most difficult task an adventurer faces in preparing for a quest is
 finding some place to buy all the necessary equipment. Only the largest
 of medieval cities can generate enough business to support all the 
various shops and merchants an adventurer might have need of. Smaller 
towns and villages have only one or two specialty shops -- usually 
determined by the needs of the citizens or a nearby customer base, such 
as a military garrison. Everything else must be bought through a general
 store or traveling merchants. Both these sources have only a limited 
supply of any particular item, but they often take special orders and 
can usually acquire the goods in a few weeks or months.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many
 villages, towns, and cities also host Market Days on a regular basis 
(generally anywhere from once a week to once per month). This is a day 
when any merchant or artisan can come into town and set up a stall from 
which to sell his or her wares. This way, the citizens can buy from a 
wider array of shops and specialists than their town can support, and 
the merchants can make a living even though there isn't an overwhelming 
need for their services in any one place.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 particular town's Market Day usually features the same merchants each 
time. Their wares change based on seasonal needs or crops, but the same 
faces can be seen on a month-to-month basis. Occasionally, a new face 
will show up -- a stranger selling rare or unique items. And, once in a 
very great while, a group of traveling merchants show up together and 
transform an ordinary Market Day into an event that will be talked about
 for years to come.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One such band of traveling merchants has come to be known as the Itinerant Bazaar.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Itinerant Bazaar</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Itinerant Bazaar is a band of merchants who deal in all sorts of exotic
 and rare goods -- everything from spices to weapons and armor. They 
arrive without preamble in a town early in the morning of a Market Day. 
In some cases, this group may outnumber the regular merchants by as many
 as two to one. Generally each merchant has one or more wagons that can 
be converted quickly into elaborate booths and displays.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 members of the Itinerant Bazaar are quite friendly to all the locals, 
including the regional competition. In fact, they make it a practice to 
avoid direct competition with the local merchants refrain from selling 
goods that are identical to those offered by someone who regularly 
attends that particular Market Day. What's more, the Itinerant Bazaar is
 said to have phenomenally low prices -- so low, in fact, that local 
merchants often buy from them in bulk at the end of the Market Day so 
that they can provide the suddenly popular items in the weeks to come. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There
 is no telling where the Itinerant Bazaar will turn up next. It arrives 
in a town without any warning. Indeed nobody knows for sure how the 
merchants knew there was going to be a Market Day. They simply show up 
at the crack of dawn, spend the day selling their wares, and then ride 
out in the gloom of dusk.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">More
 interesting, unlike other traveling merchants, the bazaar does not 
visit more than a single Market Day in a particular region. Even when 
there is another market -- even a bigger, more profitable one -- coming 
up soon in a neighboring town, the Itinerant Bazaar passes it by. Their 
wagons roll out of town, not to be seen again for a very long time. In 
fact, for many small towns, a visit from the Itinerant Bazaar becomes 
the stuff of legends -- the Day of Plenty, or the Golden Market Day.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 it is generally believed that the bazaar visits a particular Market Day
 only once, PCs who get curious and ask the right questions may discover
 one or more of the following facts.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 bazaar occasionally does visit the same Market Day more than once, but 
there is always a span of at least 50 years between visits. (That is a 
long time for humans, but elves may well remember five or ten different 
visits by the bazaar in their lifetimes.) <br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 merchants in the bazaar never sell any items that originate in the area
 they are visiting. They sell goods only from far away lands.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">No one has ever seen the Itinerant Bazaar on the road -- only when they roll into a town.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wizards
 or adventurers who can travel great distances magically claim to have 
seen the Itinerant Bazaar on consecutive days at opposite ends of a 
continent (or even on different continents).</span></li>
</ul>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#F2F2F2" width="95%"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>How Do They Do That?</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Itinerant Bazaar does not travel by normal means. Indeed, the bazaar is
 not technically of this world. Its proprietors hail from the Plane of 
Shadow, and the bazaar is headquartered there. The other merchants come 
from all over the planes, though the proprietors insist that merchants 
pass as indigenous peoples wherever the bazaar goes. A great many of 
them were once local merchants who, when the Itinerant Bazaar visited, 
requested to join the organization (though most of them didn't actually 
understand at the time what exactly that entailed).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 it is an extraplanar organization, the Itinerant Bazaar does all its 
business on the Material Plane. The proprietors have no wish to get 
involved in planar politics -- they just want to use their knowledge of 
the planes to make money from the people of the Material Plane.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Shadow
 Wagons: All the wagons associated with the bazaar are enhanced so that 
they can travel freely between the Plane of Shadow and the Material 
Plane during the hour preceding dawn and dusk. Anyone or anything on or 
touching the wagon is likewise transported. If a passenger or piece of 
cargo is incapable of making the transition (for example, a character 
who is the subject of a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell) the wagon and 
the rest of its cargo fades out around him, her, or it. While the wagon 
goes to the Plane of Shadow, it leaves the affected character or item on
 the Material Plane.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To avoid drawing too much attention to the bazaar, its proprietors use the following guidelines when planning its schedule.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">1. Never visit a given location more than once every fifty years</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">2.
 After visiting a location, there must be a minimum of one month's time 
before visiting any other location within one hundred miles.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">3. Whenever possible do not visit the same continent twice in the same ten-day period.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>How to Find the Bazaar</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Itinerant Bazaar's schedule can be very confusing, particularly to 
anyone who is not used to thinking of his or her world on a global 
scale, and even more so to anyone who has no experience with planar 
travel. However, with a little bit of information and a good deal of 
luck, characters may predict the movements of the bazaar. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 first thing a character must know is the dates and locations of at 
least four places the Itinerant Bazaar has visited in the past six 
months. Then he or she may attempt a Gather Information check (DC 50) 
which, if it succeeds, allows the character to determine the next three 
locations the bazaar will visit. This check receives an insight bonus 
equal to the number of ranks the character has in Knowledge (the 
planes). It also receives a +10 circumstance bonus if one of the 
locations is more than two thousand miles away from the nearest other. 
Finally the check gains a +5 competence bonus if the character has 
actually attended the bazaar in the last six months. (If he or she has 
attended the bazaar more than once, the competence bonus is equal to 5 
times the number of attendances.)</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 random encounters usually happen by chance, some DMs may wish to tie 
these four parts together into something that could lead to further 
adventures. You've read about the bazaar in a general sense, and now you
 can introduce the concept of it to your game. (Perhaps the PCs have 
heard rumors of an unusual bazaar in the region that showed up several 
months ago but that had an item that they're seeking.) If you want 
further details, though, watch for more on NPCs, rules, and items in 
upcoming installments.</span></p>
