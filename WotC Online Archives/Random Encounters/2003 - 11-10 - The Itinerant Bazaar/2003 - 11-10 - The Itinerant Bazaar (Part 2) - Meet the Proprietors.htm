<p class="size2">The Itinerant Bazaar may not be unique in the vastness 
of the planes, but chances are that they are the only planes-traveling 
merchants that most of their customers are likely to ever meet. A visit 
from the bazaar can be the spark that allows a curious mind to begin 
delving into the mysteries of the planes, or it can be the impetus for a
 group of adventurers to start thinking in terms other than their local 
Material Plane politics. </p>
<p class="size2">In any case, the merchants associated with the bazaar 
can be important people in the lives of the people they meet. In 
particular, the motivations and inclinations of the bazaar's proprietors
 may have a strong impact on how they treat the PCs.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#F2F2F2" width="95%"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size2">What About Stat Blocks?</p>
<p class="size2">The Itinerant Bazaar is not at all a place for combat. 
Furthermore, the exact capabilities of the merchants and proprietors are
 not important, except in proportional relation to the PCs. Therefore, 
we do not present firm statistics for the characters below. Instead we 
provide guidelines to the DM for tailoring them to his or her specific 
campaign and give you a sample set of statistics for each character that
 can give you a good idea of where to start.</p>
<p class="size2">As a rule, the NPCs below should be three levels higher
 than the PCs when they first meet. The DM may decide from that point on
 whether to keep the NPCs more-or-less permanently at that level or 
allow them to gain levels at the same rate as the PCs (or any other 
rate).</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Nana Júichi</b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2011-10%20-%20The%20Itinerant%20Bazaar%20%28Part%202%29%20-%20Meet%20the%20Proprietors_files/RE21103_d20dq.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="196" width="165">Nana
 is a middle-aged female gnome with long silver hair that she keeps 
braided and tied tight to the back of her head in a pair of buns. She 
has a winning smile and is as gregarious as they come; she spends hours 
talking with customers and even passersby who have no intention of 
buying anything in her stall. Probably because her effervescent 
personality is mixed with her diminutive size, people find it very easy 
to trust Nana and they often open up to her with personal information 
that they haven't told even their closest friends. She just has a way of
 making them feel safe.</p>
<p class="size2">Sadly, this is all a charade. Nana is actually a very 
bitter, cynical, manipulative person who uses people's trust to her own 
advantage. She began life as an orphan left to fend for herself in the 
streets of a large city on the Material Plane. There she developed the 
basic skills of a pickpocket and confidence artist, and she learned to 
value no one and nothing over her own comfort and safety. After being 
caught by the constables and thrown in jail for six months, Nana decided
 that she needed a less risky way to make a living. She had grown into a
 charming young woman, and she used her ability to make personal 
connections to become a broker -- neither a merchant nor a buyer, but 
someone who could put the two together and be paid a commission for 
doing so. This might have been the whole story of her life except that a
 wizard client asked for her help in solving a problem in another city. 
The matter was urgent, so the man used the <i>shadow walk</i> spell to 
allow them to travel to the other city. Nana concluded the deal to the 
customer's satisfaction, but instead of taking her usual fee, she asked 
him to teach her everything he knew about the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p class="size2">Nana began using the Plane of Shadow to crisscross her 
world and making deals that no one else could. Whenever she encountered a
 need that she could not fulfill, she found someone who could and 
brokered the deal instead. Eventually, she had more connections through 
the Plane of Shadow than she ever did in her hometown. She was content 
to use these connections sparingly, one at a time, until she met Luvi 
Tonne. His idea for an interplanar exchange made her realize that she 
could do more than gather money (which she was doing exceptionally 
well). After spending enough time at this, she could actually use her 
connections to manipulate whole nations and change the course of history
 by making herself the most powerful political figure in the entire 
Material Plane.</p>
<p class="size2">At this point, she is still in the relative early 
stages of that plan -- traveling with the bazaar and gathering 
information on the strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies of nobles and 
governments across the map. Eventually, she plans to leave the bazaar 
and use this information to begin amassing real power.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Nana's Stats</b></p>
<p class="size2">Nana should be either a straight rogue or a rogue/bard 
multiclass. She should have high Dexterity and Charisma scores, but a 
low Strength score. She always has the maximum number of ranks possible 
in Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Sense Motive, and Spot. </p>
<p class="size2">Early in her career, Nana should pick up feats that are
 helpful to a pickpocket, such as Deft Hands, Nimble Fingers, and 
Stealthy. Later on she should focus on feats that help her in social 
engineering, such as Investigator, Leadership, Negotiator, and 
Persuasive.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Luvi Tonne</b></p>
<p class="size2">Luvi Tonne is an elegant male half-elf with an air of 
sophistication that often makes him seem aloof. His hair is cut very 
short and he slicks it back with an oil that surrounds him with a scent 
reminiscent of a springtime breeze. This look accentuates his elven 
features, making it seem as though his ears are even longer and more 
pointed and his eyes larger and more catlike. His eyes are the color of 
ice, and his smile (which he offers only to his closest friends) can 
seem chilling. Luvi is not a talkative man. In fact, he seems 
uncomfortable in conversations that revolve around anything other than 
the arts -- and he can be a vicious critic of those since he often 
savagely picks apart the faults of a painting, ballad, or design he 
feels is too pedestrian. </p>
<p class="size2">Because Luvi is such a sharp-tongued critic, many 
people presume that the half-elf is mean spirited and confrontational. 
The truth is that he has a kind and gentle soul -- he is just painfully 
shy. Luvi is bold only when speaking about art because he has such 
passion for the subject and is supremely confident in his knowledge and 
opinions.</p>
<p class="size2">Originally from the Elven Court on the plane of 
Arborea, the half-elf was apprenticed at an early age to the court's 
master clothier. Young Luvi quickly proved to have a gift for fashion, 
and he created jackets, gowns, and accessories that became the most 
sought after in the realm. Indeed, nobles and financiers from all the 
good-aligned planes traveled to Arborea and willingly spent fortunes to 
get Luvi to design an outfit for them -- all this while he was still an 
apprentice.</p>
<p class="size2">Luvi saw his master getting rich, and the already 
well-heeled courtiers strutting around like peacocks in his clothing. 
He, himself, was still forced to dress only in the plain robes of an 
apprentice, and he noticed that the clothing worn by common folk was 
serviceable but mind-numbingly dull. In secret, he began to design 
outfits for the servants and commoners -- clothing that was practical, 
bespoke of their station, but yet still had flair and style. When his 
master found out, Luvi was beaten. "Fashion is for those who can afford 
it," the clothier said. "Your designs are art. Why do you want to drape 
them across pigs?" As soon as his wounds healed, Luvi ran away from his 
master, abandoning his apprenticeship and leaving the plane of Arborea 
forever.</p>
<p class="size2">In his heart, he agreed with his former master that his
 designs were art. But Luvi completely disagreed that they should be 
only for the rich. He believed that art was for everyone, no matter how 
poor or rich, and he meant to share his designs with anyone who wanted 
them. Eventually, he settled on the Plane of Shadow because it presented
 an interesting challenge. Everything on the plane appears colorless, so
 his designs had to be created using only his memory of what the hues 
and values of the cloth was. If anything, Luvi's work only improved. </p>
<p class="size2">Luvi began taking his outfits to the Material Plane -- 
as unfashionable and bucolic a place as there is in the planes. Not 
surprisingly, his work again became much sought after. But he noticed 
that these people were deprived of so much more than just fashion. Their
 limited understanding of the planes meant that they did not even take 
full advantage of the meager resources of their own plane, let alone any
 others. So, back on the Plane of Shadows, he began inviting other 
merchants to join him on his excursions, hoping to expose the masses to 
even more of the amazing worlds beyond their own. It was then that Luvi 
met a gnome mercantile broker named Nana Júichi who seemed to have the 
same noble goals in mind that he did. The two worked together to form 
what has since come to be known as the Itinerant Bazaar.</p>
<p class="size2">Of course, Luvi has since learned that his partner's 
motives are much less pure than his own. She wants to use the bazaar for
 her own personal gains, with no care for the effects it has on the 
people of the Material Plane. But for the most part, that does not 
matter. The half-elf has created a market for his designs and a way to 
share them with the entirety of reality. His art can be seen, purchased,
 and worn by anyone. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Luvi's Stats</b></p>
<p class="size2">Luvi is best off taking levels of bard or rogue, though
 he might have a level or two of wizard thrown in if you want him to 
make enhanced clothing without assistance. He should have a high 
Intelligence score and a low Charisma score. He always has the maximum 
possible number of ranks in Appraise, Craft (tailoring), and Profession 
(tailor). Luvi uses his Craft (tailoring) skill to make his wares and 
his Profession (tailor) skill to create his designs. He also keeps his 
scores as high as possible in several Knowledge categories including 
history, local, nobility and royalty, and the planes.</p>
<p class="size2">As far as feats go, Luvi tends toward those that 
enhance his abilities such as Diligent and Skill Focus. He does not take
 offensive combat feats, but he might choose one or two that would make 
him avoid damage, such as Stealthy or the Dodge tree.</p>

able to see and hear Luvi. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill 
checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear 
the bard's music. The DM may rule that certain uses of this ability are 
infeasible. The effect lasts as long as Luvi concentrates, up to a 
maximum of 2 minutes. Luvi can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire 
competence is a mind-affecting ability. </p>
<p class="size2"><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i> Allies who can hear Luvi 
receive a +1 morale bonus to saves against charm and fear effects and a 
+1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. The effect lasts for 5
 rounds after the ally can no longer hear him.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Half-Elf Traits:</b> Luvi is immune to magic sleep 
spells and effects, and he has elven blood (for all effects related to 
race, he is considered an elf). Luvi also has a +2 racial bonus on saves
 against enchantment spells or effects, a +2 racial bonus on diplomacy 
and Gather Information checks, and a +1 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, 
and Search checks (already figured into the statistics given above).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bard Spells Known:</b> None (insufficient Charisma to cast bard spells).</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Unfriendly Competition</b></p>
<p class="size2">Although they are partners, it should be clear that 
Nana and Luvi have different goals and expectations for the Itinerant 
Bazaar. So, to make things more palatable, they agreed upon a set of 
rules of behavior for both the organization and any vendor associated 
with it. To appease Nana's desire for broad-scale information gathering,
 the bazaar visits all corners of the world, but to satisfy Luvi's 
desire for equanimity, it visits each locale only once in a very great 
while. To meet the half-elf's desire to introduce new ideas and 
concepts, the vendors sell items that their customers cannot find at 
other markets, but to meet the gnome's need for friendly relations with 
native power brokers, the visiting merchants are forbidden from directly
 competing with (and thereby angering) the locals.</p>
<p class="size2">This might seem needlessly complex, but both Luvi and 
Nana feel a sense of ownership to the bazaar -- they built it from 
nothing into a legendary organization. They also both have long-term 
goals for which it is the only viable engine. So they have made peace 
and agreed to disagree, swearing never to take part in any effort to 
undermine or oust the other from a position of authority within the 
bazaar. But the truth is that nothing would make either one of these 
uncomfortable partners happier than to see the other forced out of the 
picture.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">If the PCs come across the bazaar, allow them to 
interact with one or the other (or even both) of the proprietors. 
Perhaps Nana needs some information from the PCs and approaches them at 
the local tavern in a friendly manner "just to chat." Or maybe the PCs 
need some clothing from Luvi so that they are presentable in a future 
appearance at the local leader's house.</p>
