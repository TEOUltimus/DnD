<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>The Unexpectedly Powerful Monster</b></p>
<p align="left"> A continually unsettling moment for players is when a 
combat they thought would be relatively easy turns out to be hard. It 
turns player expectation on its ear when something they thought they 
knew suddenly becomes unknown. Prime examples of this sort of situation 
can include orcs with barbarian or sorcerer levels or monsters with 
unexpected templates. For experienced players, choose iconic monsters 
such as beholders or ropers, where the players know just enough to think
 they know what's coming.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2002-09%20-%20Nasty%20Surprises%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20The%20Unexpectedly%20Powerful%20Monster_files/DnD_02092004_fh209_1.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="316" width="231">In
 the first round of combat, have the monster lead with its most 
devastating attack in an attempt to deal maximum damage on its first 
blow. Everyone at the table may get a jolt when the clerical umber hulk 
drops a maximized <i>flame strike</i> on the front ranks.</p>
<p align="left">When you do this, try to spend it on the PCs with the 
most hit points. Physically overpowering the party wizard isn't really 
all that awe-inspiring, but knocking out half the barbarian's hit points
 in one attack could have everyone wondering what else their latest 
opponent can dish out. Below are a couple of ready-made monsters you can
 drop on characters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Furthsthfa Viciousmien</b></p>
<p align="left">Furthsthfa came across a wisdom-boosting magic stole 
when he destroyed a group of pious adventurers who entered his lair. 
After paying to have it identified, he put it on. The sudden burst of 
insight compelled him to further his power by worshiping evil gods of 
the underground. The umber hulk doesn't seem too fixated on one god; 
Maglubiyet, Erythnul, Lolth, and a few obscure underground monster 
deities all seem part of Furthsthfa's ecumenical hate. Now, he travels 
on an unholy mission to punish further surface intrusion into the evil 
dark below. Unnecessary digging and loud noises seem to be among his 
most punishable activities.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Furthsthfa:</b> Male umber hulk cleric 7; CR 14; 
Large aberration; HD 8d8+35 plus 7d8+28; hp 130; Init +1; Spd 20 ft., 
burrow 20 ft.; AC 20, touch 12, flat-footed 19; Base Atk +11; Grp +21; 
Atk +16 melee (2d6+6, 2 claws); Full Atk +16 melee (2d6+6, 2 claws) and 
+14 melee (2d8+3, bite); Space/Reach 10 ft./10 ft.; SA confusing gaze, 
rebuke undead 4/day; SQ darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 60 ft.; AL CE; SV
 Fort +13, Ref +5, Will +15; Str 23, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 11, Wis 18, Cha
 13. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Climb +12, Concentration +9, 
Hide -3, Jump +9, Knowledge (religion) +5, Listen +13; Craft Wand, 
Empower Spell, Great Fortitude, Improved Natural Attack (claw), 
Multiattack, Toughness.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Confusing Gaze (Su):</b> Any creature within 30 feet that meets Furthsthfa's gaze is affected as if by confusion (caster level 8th; Will DC 15 negates).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tremorsense (Ex):</b> Furthsthfa can detect the location of any creature within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cleric Spells Prepared</b> (6/6/5/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level): 0 -- <i>create water, detect magic</i> (2), <i>inflict minor wounds</i> (2), <i>read magic;</i> 1st -- <i>cause fear, comprehend languages, endure elements, entropic shield, protection from good*, sanctuary; </i>2nd -- <i>bear's endurance, darkness, death knell, desecrate*, silence;</i> 3rd -- <i>animate dead, contagion*, dispel magic, protection from energy; </i>4th -- <i>dismissal, lesser planar ally, unholy blight*.</i></p>
<p align="left">*Domain spell. Deity: None. Domains: Destruction (smite 1/day), Evil (cast evil spells at +1 caster level).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Possessions: Stole of Wisdom +6, ring of protection +2, </i>10<i> potions of greater magic fang,</i><i>wand of cure serious wounds</i> (34 charges).</p>
<p align="left"><b>River of Raging Orcs</b></p>
<p align="left">There's nothing unusual about orc barbarians, but 
players expect to meet only one powerful orc barbarian or a small group 
of wimpy ones simply because orcs are never really a threat past 3rd 
level.</p>
<p align="left">This metaphorical river of rage is not especially wimpy 
though, and they travel in large groups. They look like a normal mob of 
orcs, but their exceptional number of hit points when raging will keep 
them in the fight long past the point where players expect them to fall 
down. Further, when they swarm to flank and every one of them 
simultaneously power attacks, at least a few will get through and deal 
terrifying amounts of damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Orc Barbarian:</b> Male orc barbarian 4; CR 4; Medium
 humanoid (orc); HD 4d12+8; hp 34; Init +1; Spd 40 ft.; AC 15, touch 11,
 flat-footed 15; Base Atk +4; Grp +8; Atk +9 melee (1d12+7/x3, <i>+1 greataxe</i>) or +5 ranged (1d8/x3, longbow); Full Atk +9 melee (1d12+7/x3, <i>+1 greataxe</i>)
 or +5 ranged (1d8/x3, longbow); SQ darkvision 60 ft., fast movement, 
illiteracy, light sensitivity, rage 2/day, trap sense +1, uncanny dodge;
 AL CE; SV Fort +6, Ref +2, Will -1; Str 18, Dex 12, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 
7, Cha 6. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Climb +9, Jump +13, Listen +5, Spot +0, Survival +4; Alertness, Power Attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Illiteracy:</b> The orc barbarian does not know how to read and write.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> The orc barbarian is dazzled in bright light or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rage: </b>The following changes are in effect as long
 as the orc rages: 4d12+16; hp 42; Spd 40 ft.; AC 13, touch 9, 
flat-footed 13; Grp +10; Atk +11 melee (1d12+10/x3, <i>+1 greataxe</i>) or +5 ranged (1d8/x3, longbow); Full Atk +11 melee (1d12+10/x3, <i>+1 greataxe</i>)
 or +5 ranged (1d8/x3, longbow); SV Fort +8, Will +1; Str 22, Con 18; 
Climb +11, Jump +15. His fit of rage lasts for 7 rounds, though he may 
voluntarily end it prematurely. After raging, he is fatigued (-2 
Strength, -2 Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of that 
encounter. The orc can fly into a rage only once per encounter and only 
once per day. Entering a rage takes no time by itself, but the orc can 
do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> The orc has a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> The orc barbarian can react 
to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of
 it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being caught 
flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. He still loses any 
Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +1 greataxe, </i>longbow, quiver with 20 arrows,<i> cure light wounds potion,</i> 20 silver pieces.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="left">While it's recommended that you don't spring a series of
 these nasty little surprises on your unsuspecting PCs one right after 
the other, you may want to include them in the tools available to one of
 the group's foes. As such, space out each of these installments or 
utilize them in a master plan to keep your players and their PCs on 
their toes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Coming in Part 2 of Nasty Surprises </b></p>
<p align="left">Has death become a mere inconvenience to your PCs (and their players)? If so, pop the <i>soul crusher</i> into your campaign at an appropriate moment and see what happens!</p>
