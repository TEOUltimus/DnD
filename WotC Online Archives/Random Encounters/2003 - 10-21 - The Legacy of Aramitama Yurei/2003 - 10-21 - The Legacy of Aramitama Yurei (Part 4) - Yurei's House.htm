<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:15px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#CC0000;"><b>Yurei's House</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 a distance, the exterior of the house looks much like that of the 
standard commoner. Its roof consists of clay tiles and its walls are 
made of stone covered mostly in vines and other vegetation from the 
years of neglect. The house has an entrance at the front as well as on 
the back and side of the house via the veranda. </span></p>
<p align="center"><img src="2003%20-%2010-21%20-%20The%20Legacy%20of%20Aramitama%20Yurei%20%28Part%204%29%20-%20Yurei%27s%20House_files/yureihouse_lg.jpg" alt="Map by Mark A Jindra" title="Map by Mark A Jindra" border="0" height="487" width="515"></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Customizing the House:</b>
 The descriptions of each room show the areas as they looked several 
years ago when Yurei lived here and also provide a description of what 
they are like after years of exposure to creatures and the elements. 
Enterprising DMs can find many places to insert something special to 
personalize the house. For instance, one or more of the locks to the 
storage room may be trapped, or the house may have become the home of 
any number of creatures such as a band of nats (<i>Oriental Adventures</i>, page 176) or perhaps a fire toad (<i>Oriental Adventures,</i> page 196). </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Solid Walls:</b>
 The solid walls of the house are crafted from large stone blocks made 
from volcanic rock. Their surface is matte black and rough to the touch.
 However, the rock also contains plentiful flecks of black crystal that 
reflects light, which causes the stone to sparkle when the sun strikes 
it just right. The crystal is imbedded in the stone and has no intrinsic
 value. While the structure was created long ago, the solid walls of the
 structure have held up well over the years and show little to no signs 
of wear. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Solid Walls: </b>1 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 90; break DC 35; climb DC 20.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sliding Rice Paper Walls:</b>
 The sliding walls of the structure have not fared as well as their 
solid counterparts. Over the years, the weather, along with the 
attentions of roving bands of various creatures, has deteriorated the 
walls so that little remains. Even the intricately carved wooden 
framework has long since been burned for firewood or used to craft a 
makeshift spear or staff.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sliding Rice Paper Walls: </b>paper thin; hardness --; hp 1; break DC 1; climb DC 10.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>1. Entrance:</b>
 At the front of the entrance gapes a doorway where two intricately 
carved wooden doors once stood. Now all that remains is a single rusted 
iron hinge from which an oxidized old lantern sways in the wind. Just 
inside the entrance the wooden flooring has been torn up and exposes the
 ground beneath. The remnants of a fire and some bones of indeterminate 
origin lie in the dirt. The room is empty of furniture and screens, 
which allows viewers to see directly into the bath and kitchen areas. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>2. Living Room:</b>
 The wooden floor in this room is intact although covered in a thin 
layer of dirt. Several badly rusted iron spikes can be found in the 
stone walls of this room. Once tapestries that were woven from the 
finest materials and depicted events in Yurei's life hung from the wall.
 There is a single stone pillar in this room; it appears to be made of 
the same stone as the solid stone walls of the structure. There are 
several holes in opposite sides of the pillar where once wooden stakes 
formed a ladder with which one could access the roof of the structure. 
Yurei would go to the roof from time to time to sit and meditate in the 
moonlight. The rice paper walls to the shrine, lavatory, bedroom, and 
veranda are all gone. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>3. Closet:</b>
 This small room once held a vast collection of wonderful clothing from 
all over the land. Now what remains is merely a pile of torn and 
tattered rags that some creature has used to make its bed. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>4. Shrine:</b>
 Nothing remains of the shrine that once stood here. Instead a pile of 
wood stands haphazardly against the outer wall. Removing the debris 
reveals a hidden area in the floor where Yurei once hid one of the fake 
sianghams; the area has long since been looted.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>5. Lavatory:</b> This room has been filled with wood and no longer serves its original purpose.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>6. Bath:</b>
 The marble floor of this room has held up rather well, although it now 
has a covering of mud and clay tiles that fell in on this area of the 
house when a portion of the roof collapsed. Where once stood a pool of 
water in which to cleanse oneself now stands a half-filled pool of 
muddy, foul rank water. Most of the solid stone walls in this room are 
covered in vines growing up from the pool. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>7. Bedroom:</b>
 The rice paper wall leading to the veranda is gone, which leaves the 
room open to the elements. The floor here is covered in a thin layer of 
dirt, and vines now grow from the rotting wood and cloth that was once 
an ornate bed covered in the finest of materials. Beneath the debris is a
 hidden door leading down to the workshop 10 feet below; the wood is 
weakened from the elements and breaks away easily if walked upon. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>8. Kitchen:</b>
 Once a kitchen filled with all kinds of culinary utensils, fine wooden 
cabinets, and plentiful dried goods, the room now lays in waste. The 
fine wooden cabinets and counters ravaged for their firewood and their 
fine marble countertops lay in hundreds of pieces scattered about the 
room, mixed in with the remnants of fine crystal plates and cups. The 
floor here has a thin layer of dirt upon it and some moldering bags that
 once contained some sort of flour. Vines have crept in through the 
opening where once stood a rice paper wall leading to the veranda. The 
hearth in this room is now a pile of rubble that further exposes the 
room to the elements via a hole in the roof. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>9. Hearth:</b>
 The hearth in the kitchen was once a fine cooking station indeed, but 
time has left it in a pile of rubble. The hearth in the workshop, 
however, lays almost untouched, although its flue, once secretly 
connected to the hearth in the kitchen, is now clogged by debris. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>10. Veranda:</b>
 The wood of the veranda floor has aged and warped while being exposed 
to the elements with no attention for so many years. Its once 
intricately carved railing is now gone. The veranda adjoining the 
kitchen and bedroom has become overgrown with vines. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>11. Workshop:</b>
 Beneath the kitchen and bedroom lies Yurei's workshop, which has been 
untouched by anyone for many years. A copper teapot with a carved wooden
 handle rests on the top of the hearth. Next to the hearth lies a metal 
box filled with wood. A long wooden table runs down the center of the 
room, and it is covered in all sorts of interesting arcane 
paraphernalia. Several barrels filled with unknown liquid line one of 
the walls while cabinets filled with vials and jars of other unknown 
liquids and assorted creature parts line the other. Many books and 
scrolls written in some sort of arcane language are stored in chests 
around the room. There appear to be no light sources such as torches or 
lanterns in the room. The floor and walls of the workshop are made of 
the same stone as the solid stone walls of the house. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>12. Storage:</b>
 The door to the storage area is made of a heavy iron with three locks 
and a bar across it from the outside. The room is filled with crates and
 barrels; many of the crates contain fine clothes, intricately carved 
figurines, and statues. A second fake siangham is buried within a box of
 dried tea leaves. Several odd iron rings are attached to the walls 
every 3 feet at about eye level, and from these rings hang rusted chains
 10 feet in length. The wall and floor are made of the same stone as the
 solid stone walls of the house. Beneath the contents of the room lie an
 intricately carved magic symbol and several runes. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bringing the Parts Together</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now
 that you have all parts of this series, it shouldn't be hard to find 
ways to use Yurei and his items in your campaign. We hope that you will 
take the time to stop by the message boards and let us know how it 
worked out for you!</span></p>
