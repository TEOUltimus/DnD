 Yurei, his self-given name, came from a rural family. His father was a 
sohei while his mother worked the fields. When Yurei reached the age to 
begin his apprenticeship, his father realized Yurei was not a strong boy
 and could not follow the path of the sohei. Instead, his father 
petitioned the monks to train him. It was his father's standing with the
 monastery that made the monks accept him as a student.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yurei
 trained to become a monk because his father had told him to do so. But 
he hated every day of it. The discipline, the self-denial, and the 
meagerness of it all grated on him. He desired more. He wanted to see 
what was beyond the hills surrounding the village in which he lived. So 
upon reaching adulthood, he left the monastery since his duty to his 
father was completed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">During
 a cold, wet night shortly after his escape, he couldn't get a fire 
started. That is when it happened. His anger at himself, the wood, the 
rain, and even the gods welled up within him until it exploded; he had 
triggered an <i>elemental burst</i>. While wiping the blood from his 
face, he almost couldn't contain his fear and excitement. He remembered 
the stories that humans had to be possessed by demons to have this 
ability, but he knew he wasn't possessed. He had to be special. He began
 to experiment and learn. He found his limits and sought to overcome 
them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 the meantime, he continued to travel to see new things and meet new 
people. He saw how most people take advantage of each other and vowed no
 one would ever have control over him again. He reasoned the best way to
 avoid that fate was to learn how to use people himself. Along the way, 
he learned the various levels of control and mastered each one. He also 
learned of dark secrets that humans should not know, but his arrogance 
led him to attempt to master those as well.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yurei
 roamed the world for close to 20 years before the desire to see his 
mother again struck him. He traveled home only to find that his mother 
and many other villagers had been slain during a hengeyokai raid. Yurei 
found and destroyed them. Upon his return to the village, his father 
asked him to stay and visit a while. Yurei considered his options, and 
while boring, the village and valley would make a good place to stay low
 and hopefully avoid the majority of his pursuers. During his quest for 
power, he had made many enemies. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 villagers did not know of his most recent past, and due to his 
trappings, believed Yurei to be a wu jen. Yurei maintained two lives; 
one as Yinjinko Hiro, the village hero and protector, and his true life,
 the sorcerer who dabbled in the dark arts during the secrecy of night. 
Yurei established a home away from the village and explained to the 
villagers that many of the arts of the wu jen could be dangerous to the 
village itself.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Everything
 was well in Yurei's world. A short visit had become 20 years, and he 
continued his learning in relative peace. Occasionally, he had to deal 
with an assassin from the past, but for the most part, he was left to 
himself. But, he just disappeared one day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">They
 discovered his disappearance after his father became ill and nearly 
died. The village sent a runner to fetch Hiro, and the runner found the 
house empty. The runner also found things that terrified him. His tale 
led the village to believe the Oni had taken Yurei. Since that time, the
 house has been left empty.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>DM Note: </b>If
 using the Rokugan campaign setting, Yinjinko Hiro belonged to the 
Dragon clan, though Aramitama Yurei claims no affiliation. The DM should
 outfit Yurei with the appropriate magic items for her campaign, taking 
into consideration that Yurei is an accomplished magic item craftsman. 
(See part 3 for another option for Yurei.)</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Flurry of Blows:</b>
 Aramitama can use the full attack action to make one extra attack per 
round with an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon at his highest 
base attack, but this attack and each other attack made that round takes
 a -2 penalty. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it affects attacks 
of opportunity the monk might make before his next action. If armed with
 a kama, nunchaku, or siangham, Aramitama makes the extra attack either 
with that weapon or unarmed. If armed with two such weapons, he uses one
 for his regular attack(s) and the other for the extra attack. In any 
case, his damage bonus on the attack with his off hand is not reduced.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Unarmed Strike:</b>
 Aramitama has Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. Usually his 
unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal 
damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same 
choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage when grappling. Aramitama also
 deals 1d6-1 points of damage with his unarmed strikes.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 random encounters usually happen by chance, some DMs may wish to tie 
these four parts together into something that could lead to further 
adventures. All four parts of the series work best as a whole, however 
DMs can easily use any of the four pieces separately in their campaign. 
While Yurei is no longer with us, party members could be introduced to 
him early in a campaign before he meets his end. Perhaps they can even 
help him with an errand to retrieve some special jade he needs to 
complete the siangham.</span></p>
