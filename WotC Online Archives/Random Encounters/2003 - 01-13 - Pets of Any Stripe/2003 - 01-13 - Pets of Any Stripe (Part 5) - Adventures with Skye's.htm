<p class="size2"><b>Adventures with Skye's</b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2001-13%20-%20Pets%20of%20Any%20Stripe%20%28Part%205%29%20-%20Adventures%20with%20Skye%27s_files/re_dec2002_5.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="233" width="176">Skye's Animal Companions can provide the impetus for all kinds of adventures. Take a look at some of the ideas below!</p>
<p class="size2">1. You can use Skye's to send the player characters off
 to some other part of your campaign world for some exotic adventures, 
provided they are supposed to return. For example, suppose you want to 
move your campaign to a setting similar to the one presented in <i>Oriental Adventures</i>.
 You could just whisk them off magically, but it might be more fun for 
the players if they went there by their own choice. Somehow the 
characters come to the attention of the owners of Skye's, who have need 
of real field agents for the first time in years. A little later, 
Celeste hires them to go to this land and capture a rare animal for her 
-- one that she has never even heard of (she has moxie, that Celeste 
does). If you want a fast trip, she can arrange <i>teleport </i>spells for them, or she can send them by mundane means.</p>
<p class="size2">Along the way, a lot of different adventures could 
befall the characters while they are looking for whatever it was that 
Celeste sent them to find. And once they have it, the possibilities open
 up considerably. It could be stolen, or it could be protected and thus 
get them arrested for capturing it. It could turn out to be the sacred 
symbol of some isolated tribe of natives, in which case the tribe would 
either be very upset with the PCs for having captured it or very 
grateful to the PCs for having brought them one, since the last one ran 
away just two days ago. And so on . . .</p>
<p class="size2">2. A certain pasha (or king, or chieftain, or whatever)
 owns some prize dogs. One of the pasha's enemies kidnaps one of the 
dogs and plans to hold it for ransom. The villain takes the dog to a 
small village, where it escapes confinement and makes its way to the 
city that Skye's store happens to be in. The dog is picked up as a stray
 by some poor person and sold to Celeste.</p>
<p class="size2">The PCs, meanwhile, have been hired by the dog's owner 
to find the precious pooch, thus saving the pasha the ransom cost (not 
to mention bringing dishonor to the villain) since the ransom is more 
exorbitant than paying adventurers. The PCs track the dog's location and
 have some run-ins with the villain's minions along the way to the 
village. At the village, they are approached by the villain in disguise 
(suspicious PCs often make for a fun encounter), who claims that his 
grandson's dog ran away a few days ago. Would the characters please help
 him find it? The characters discover that neither of the dogs they are 
now after are in the village, and they get some clue that leads them to 
the city. Eventually they track the dog to Celeste's shop.</p>
<p class="size2">Celeste, however, does not have the dog anymore. The 
day before the characters arrived, the dog was transformed into some 
other animal and sold to a wealthy zoo owner or merchant or some such 
person (perhaps the characters' next patron). It is up to the PCs to 
figure out what happened to the dog and confront Celeste, who would do 
her best to help the characters without actually admitting to the secret
 behind her business. The adventurers might do this by infiltrating the 
ranch as employees and snooping around, or by keeping the place under 
surveillance, or whatever. Once they have the replacement, they would 
have to make a switch without arousing any suspicions.</p>
<p class="size2">The villain, who has been following the adventurers, 
prepares to strike as soon as they have the animal back. Once the 
villain has been taken care of, the characters can return the villain 
and the pet to the pasha and collect their reward.</p>
<p class="size2">3. Skye's could become the hub of a smuggling ring. A 
crime boss recognizes Celeste/Alisha and blackmails her to keep her 
secret. He also discovers the secret of the shop. Immediately perceiving
 the usefulness of such a set-up, he forces Celeste into fronting for 
his smuggling organization. He has stray dogs and even his own hirelings
 loaded up with stolen goods and then transformed into pets. Celeste 
ships the pets to various places he designates, where they are returned 
to their own forms and the loot recovered. The crime boss pays Celeste 
to be sure that she is implicated. The PCs are hired to investigate the 
smuggling racket -- maybe even by Celeste, who hires them without 
telling them she is involved as deeply as she is.</p>
