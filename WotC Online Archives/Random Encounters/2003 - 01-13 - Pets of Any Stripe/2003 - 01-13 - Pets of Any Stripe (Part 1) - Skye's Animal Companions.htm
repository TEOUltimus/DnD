<p class="size2"><b>Skye's Animal Companions</b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2001-13%20-%20Pets%20of%20Any%20Stripe%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Skye%27s%20Animal%20Companions_files/re_dec2002_1.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="162" width="153">Skye's
 Animal Companions is a pet shop located in a large city with a bustling
 merchant trade, but it is a far from ordinary pet shop. Signs outside 
the shop promise that Skye's can provide "any and every kind of pet you 
can possibly imagine." This is much truer than anyone would ever guess. 
The shop is the brainchild of Celeste Blue-Skye, a young con artist with
 a knack for making money in creative ways. Her partner, Maephus Ibonn, 
is a transmuter, and the reason that Skye's Animal Companions is such a 
success.</p>
<p class="size2">As advertised, Skye's sells every kind of animal that 
one could want as a pet. Dogs, especially trained ones, are a mainstay 
of the business, but the shop also sells cats, rats, mice, a variety of 
snakes and exotic reptiles, birds, and hunting cats. A variety of horses
 are available, and they are trained for every task from pulling wagons 
to fighting. In addition, the shop features exotic creatures from 
far-away lands. In this category, the perennial favorites are monkeys, 
and the shop carries a selection ranging from chimps to golden lion 
tamarinds (very beautiful, but very expensive). Celeste takes orders for
 unique pets, showing interested clients a book with illustrations and 
pertinent facts of animals that she claims come from extremely far away 
locations and very rare, too.</p>
<p class="size2">Pets from Skye's Animal Companions are not cheap. 
Celeste charges as much as she can, especially for the exotic pets and 
the big cats. For common pets, her prices are competitive with those 
listed in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. For the rest, Celeste sets her 
own prices, which are often based on what she thinks the buyer can 
afford. She rarely negotiates and almost never lowers her prices more 
than 10%. Dogs and horses come with guarantees of pedigree in many 
cases. Training can be arranged as well; training fees are set at 25% of
 the price or value of the animal (whichever is greater).</p>
<p class="size2">The secret behind the success is that the normal cost 
of acquiring these rare and valuable animals has been, for the most 
part, eliminated. Maephus Ibonn uses spells to transform common animals 
into rare ones, such as transforming a rat into a "rainbow fan monkey," 
which is a rare small monkey with a colored fan-shaped hood of skin 
around its head. For this work, he uses new spells that he created to 
transform the minds of animals into those of other animals. The common 
animals are actually purchased from breeders, or raised, and the two 
have established a ranch outside the city where they breed the results 
of the transformation spells to create true animals of those types. 
Originally, Celeste planned to sell the transformed animals, but the 
cost of permanent transformations is very high, so the pair find it more
 economical to transform a couple of animals and breed them if the 
animal type is frequently requested.</p>
<p class="size2">Celeste salves her conscience by using strays and other
 unwanted animals for the transformations. Thus, she sees herself as 
giving unwanted animals homes where they will be loved or appreciated. 
She would never make an animal unhappy through this process, and once 
their minds are transformed, they are happy in their new forms. The best
 part of this scheme, according to Celeste, is that it is all perfectly 
legal. She makes sure that all her animals are licensed properly, and it
 is not fraud to sell something represented as a rainbow fan monkey if 
it really is one (even if it wasn't one before).</p>
<p class="size2">The owners of Skye's Animal Companions try to keep 
secret the fact that some of their animals used to be other animals. 
They do not fear legal repercussion, but Celeste is aware that the 
public mentality is a strange thing. It is possible that if someone 
bought a golden lion tamarind and he knew that it used to be a rat, he 
would never see it as anything other than a rat and the pet would be 
rejected. To keep the masquerade, Celeste refers to "field agents" who 
travel the world and bring her the exotic animals when needed, or who 
arrange to have them transported to her shop. These people don't exist. 
Celeste did at one time employ some rangers to find animals, but those 
were the days when she was building her catalog and did not know what 
was out there.</p>
<p class="size2">Skye's Animal Companions owns two premises: a large 
two-story shop in the city and the ranch outside the city. The ranch 
serves as breeding farm, training facility, and sales floor for the 
larger, dangerous animals. The shop is home to the main business and all
 of the smaller animals. The upstairs is devoted to birds, reptiles and 
fish, and the ground floor is for mammals. This arrangement helps to 
sell a lot of monkeys and puppies, which are placed to catch the eyes of
 browsers. A staff of four assists with sales and cares for the animals 
there.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bring the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">Although random encounters usually happen by chance, 
some DMs may wish to tie these five parts together into something that 
could lead to further adventures. Part Five of the series will contain 
some interesting ideas for introducing a "transformed pets" business 
into your campaign.</p>
