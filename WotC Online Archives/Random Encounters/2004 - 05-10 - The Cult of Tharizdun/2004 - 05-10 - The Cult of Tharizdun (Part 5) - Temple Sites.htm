<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Temple Sites </b></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Light must be snuffed, perfection decayed, order dissolved, and minds fragmented." </i>The
 mantra of the cult of Tharizdun, these words are often found etched 
into the altars, the stone pillars, and the doors within the Tharizdun's
 temples. These dark places are crushingly void of hope, and its 
followers revel in the darkness and despair that that all things almost 
certainly face at some time in their existence. Though their lord is 
currently locked away in a planar prison, the congregations praise the 
fact that even the most optimistic sages agree that in time everything 
that exists will one day pass into dust and nothingness. Tharizdun will 
win the battle, despite the opposition of all the gods.</p>
<p align="left">Each temple is led by one of the witnesses of Tharizdun,
 who are vile cultists who have risen to their positions through 
ambition, charm, and manipulation (see Part 4). The worshipers often 
reside at the temple site in opulent chambers, surrounded by riches 
donated to them by their body of worshipers. Despite their message of 
eminent decay, they partake of the finest things life has to offer. Rich
 food, rare tapestries, gold, and often harems are kept by the witness 
in charge of a temple. While the head of a temple indulges in these 
lavish surroundings, the cult uses these very things as a means of 
recruiting new followers to the temple. Those who are disenfranchised by
 society find not only acceptance, but luxury in these surroundings.</p>
<p align="left">Temple sites must be hidden from the local populace. 
Nearly all people of the Flanaess have a hatred toward the cult of 
Tharizdun. This hatred, sponsored by the gods themselves, force the cult
 into hiding. They exist in the shadows, often transforming abandoned 
buildings into temples. They have also been known to take control of 
ill-used and forgotten chambers in sewer systems beneath cities. 
Occasionally their temples exist in basements or cellars beneath houses 
belonging to respectable people who have converted.</p>
<p align="left">In the wilderness regions, the cult can afford to 
operate somewhat more openly. Structures exist in wooded depths and 
rocky plains where the followers of a region can meet and perform their 
dark rituals. The locals may believe that there is a darkness hanging 
over the region, but as long as no harm comes to them, the cult's 
activities are rarely investigated. </p>
<p align="left">While the outside of a temple to Tharizdun normally 
doesn't betray the nature of its malign denizens, the interior must 
serve as a place of worship as well as a defensive location where the 
inhabitants can defend themselves from those who would try to destroy 
them. Doorways are usually trapped in such a way that only someone 
within can disarm them to allow others entrance. Hallways are often 
lined with murder holes, rooms are constructed with a dais so that 
warriors can gain the advantage of higher ground. Guard rooms are placed
 throughout the temple and manned by either the worshipers of Tharizdun 
or elhoriads. Ceremony chambers, the private rooms belonging to the high
 priests are located deep within the temple. Many temples also have a 
permanent portal to another plane established so that they can quickly 
flee to another realm where good creatures are much less likely to 
follow.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2004%20-%2005-10%20-%20The%20Cult%20of%20Tharizdun%20%28Part%205%29%20-%20Temple%20Sites_files/DnD_MayRE5.jpg" border="0" height="386" width="500"></p>
<p align="left"><b>A Sample Temple</b></p>
<p align="left">By using one of the maps from the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mwa/archive2004">Map-A-Week feature</a>,
 you can either start playing right away or get an idea of how to lay 
out your own temple. The map chosen as a sample here represents a hidden
 temple that lurks along a seacoast. You may want to add a few other 
sea-going beasties to it to provide a nice local flavor to the perils 
your PCs will face! This sample represents a temple that is in the 
process of building itself into something more stable and permanent 
(inasmuch as Tharizdun's followers want stability). As a result, some of
 the rooms are not quite furnished to the taste of the witness in charge
 of the temple. Also, only blighters, a witness (Samiela), and elhoriads
 reside in these caves at present. Samiela's goal is to destroy the 
local fishing industry, so there should be at least one town whose 
industry is based on fish within a day or so of the caves. While she's 
doing this, she hopes to start recruiting new worshipers from nearby. 
Lack of fish can lead to despair among those whose livelihoods depend on
 the fish harvest, after all. (If the DM wishes, she may also have a 
deeper motive of seeking out a <i>net of despair</i> lost to the worshipers of Tharizdun in a shipwreck somewhere nearby.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Outside Environs</b></p>
<p align="left">The cliffs near the sea cave have a cleverly hidden path
 leading upward. The beach itself is barely a strip of sand at high 
tide, though low tide exposes a fair amount of bracken-strewn sand. Both
 the land above and the beach serve as areas for the blighters inside 
the temple to go out and find plenty of nature to destroy with their 
innate abilities. At any moment, 1d4 blighters may be outside the 
temple. (Use the statistics presented in Part 1 of this series.) Another
 nearby cave (not shown on map) has a few hidden canoes and a small ship
 owned by Samiela and crewed by the blighters she brought with her 
(replace the blighters' Listen skills with Profession [sailor]). </p>
<p align="left"><b>1. Entrance:</b> At least two elhoriads (see Part 2) lurk just within the entrance to the temple.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elhoriads (2):</b> hp 32; see Part 2.</p>
<p align="left"><b>2. Trap:</b> The area has a spiked pit trap. The DM can choose to add a few elhoriads at the bottom of this pit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spiked Pit Trap:</b> CR 3; mechanical; location 
trigger; manual reset; Reflex save (DC 14) avoids; 10 ft. deep (1d6, 
fall); pit spikes (Atk +10 melee, 3d6 damage); Search (DC 15); Disable 
Device (DC 30). <i>Market Price:</i> 5,700 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>3. Outer Temple:</b> The ceremonies for this hidden 
temple take place within this room. Four elhoriads stand guard within, 
and a ghost of a former seagoing fighter (a former pirate) wanders the 
area. There is usually one blighter here, as well (90% chance of her 
being present).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elhoriads (4):</b> hp 32; see Part 2.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghost:</b> hp 32; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 117.</p>
<p align="left"><b>4. Sea Cat Lair Trapdoor:</b> A trapdoor here opens 
into a water-filled pit that has a sea cat living in it part of the time
 (50% chance of it being present). The pit has an exit to the sea, and 
the tide brings in more water at various parts of the day. (The normal 
water depth is about 10 feet deep, but it can fluctuate between 15 feet 
deep and 5 feet deep.) One part of the wall forms a lip that is 
available only when the water depth is 10 feet or less. Samiela has 
plans to make these creatures into undead of some sort in the future.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Camouflaged Watery Pit Trap:</b> CR 5; mechanical; 
location trigger; manual reset; Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; 25 ft. deep 
(2d6, fall); multiple targets (first target in each of two adjacent 
5-ft. squares); Search (DC 25); Disable Device (DC 317). <i>Market Price:</i> 8,500 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sea Cat: </b>hp 51; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 220.</p>
<p align="left"><b>5. Witness Chamber:</b> The temple's witness of 
Tharizdun resides in a room beyond a black velvet curtain. A rich 
bear-fur rug is spread out over a sleigh bed. Two chests made of 
dark-stained oak rest at the far end of the room. A dark wardrobe stands
 opposite the bed, and a full-length silver mirror hangs on the wall to 
the left of the doorway. Despite the overriding scent of salty water, a 
pleasing aroma drifts from a censer hanging next to the bed. While the 
PCs can find several sets of rich priestly vestments and some very nice 
outfits, not much else of importance is in this room -- unless the DM 
wishes it to be.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Samiela, Witness of Tharizdun:</b> hp 110; see Part 4.</p>
<p align="left"><b>6. Eating Chamber:</b> A couple of round wooden 
tables are grouped in this room, and a cooking area, complete with brick
 oven and vent, is on the far end of the room. (The vent branches into 
several other smaller crevices, which helps disperse the cooking smoke 
in a less visible manner.) Two blighters are usually in this room taking
 a break.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blighters (2): </b>76 hp; see Part 1.</p>
<p align="left"><b>7. Privies: </b>The priests have added wooden seating
 to what used to be little more than holes in the ground. A censer 
filled with fragrant incense hangs outside each entrance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>8. Meeting Room:</b> The temple's witness has set up 
this room as a meeting room. Though the room has a few wooden chairs, 
these seats serve only to make the room look emptier. Four elhoriads are
 stationed here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elhoriads (4):</b> hp 32; see Part 2.</p>
<p align="left"><b>9. Temporary Storage and Sleeping Areas:</b> These 
rooms contain crates of food and other necessities, as well as several 
simple beds. There are usually 2d4 blighters in the area.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blighters (2d4): </b>76 hp; see Part 1.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p align="left">The ultimate challenge a party faces with regards to the
 forces of Tharizdun should be its location of strength: the temple 
itself. Uncovering and destroying a temple site can be the focus of an 
entire campaign. Once here, they face a number of deadly obstacles, 
ranging from fanatic followers who view their own deaths as progress 
toward their ultimate goal to traps, undead creatures unknown to the 
outside world, and powerful priests intent on preserving not only their 
decadent lifestyle as well as their following. If the party succeeds in 
destroying the temple but fails to eliminate the high priest, chances 
are that the temple will arise at a later point in time, even stronger 
than it is now.</p>
