 to sink slowly into the Plane of Shadow, the elusive, dangerous fey 
known as the shadar-kai seek to shake the pain and despair of the doom 
that they brought upon themselves. When humankind and its allies were 
making the first steps along the paths to civilization, the shadar-kai, 
already greatly skilled in shadow magic, sought to cast the world into 
an endless twilight. To do this, they made a powerful pact with a great 
power from the Plane of Shadow. Whether through their own misstep or 
through the intervention of others, the shadar-kai's great experiment 
went awry, and the gray-skinned fey were left bound to the Plane of 
Shadow, cursed to lose their souls in its dark depths.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Many
 of the shadar-kai have fallen to the shadow curse and no longer dare to
 set foot upon the Material Plane. However, a few -- especially powerful
 spellcasters -- still seek to rid themselves, if not their race, from 
the curse. Unable to counter the curse directly, a group of demented 
shadar-kai wizards have hit on a new stratagem for shaking the effects 
of the curse: Much like the plan of the original shadar-kai 
spellcasters, they planned to bind a portion of the Plane of Shadow to 
the Material Plane. This plan, although far less grand in scope than the
 one that brought about the shadow curse, has in part already succeeded.
 With the aid of a powerful ritual, shadar-kai wizards have bound 
essence of the Plane of Shadow to the heart of an ancient forest. This 
mighty ritual has ameliorated the effects of the shadow curse within a 
small region, freeing the shadar-kai from their self-made doom. What 
once was merely an ancient and foreboding forest is now a dark and 
twisted landscape known as the Shadow Glade.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Knowing
 that someone is sure to notice their growing power, the shadar-kai have
 sent scouts and snipers to the edges of the forest. These scouts strike
 from hiding, making no distinction between those seeking passage 
through the forest and those opposed to the spread of the corrupting 
darkness at the heart of the Shadow Glade.</span></p>

traps. Disabling a magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Introducing the Shadow Glade to Your Campaign</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 Shadow Glade can be placed in any forested region in your campaign 
world, making it easy to insert into nearly any region of a campaign. 
Here are some additional ideas to help you bring the shadar-kai and 
their plans to your game.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Whether
 passing near the forest or through it, the party could be ambushed by 
an appropriately sized group of shadar-kai snipers and scouts.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Druids,
 friendly fey, wood elves, or even a local human settlement could have 
noticed the presence of the shadar-kai's dark magic beginning to corrupt
 the forest and ask that adventurers travel to the center of the glade 
to determine the source of the changes.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 you want to include the shadar-kai in your world on a long-term basis, 
they might approach the adventurers or one of their influential friends 
to help them. Depending on your plans for the shadow fey, they might try
 to trick the adventurers and bind them to the Plane of Shadow (see the 
shadow-bound template in Part 3) or they might simply seek to establish a
 haven for their kind deep in the forest. </span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 an encounter with shadar-kai scouts can easily occur in the midst of 
any journey through wooded terrain, the DM might wish to make the run in
 part of a linked series of encounters. As the adventurers travel deeper
 into the Shadow Glade, they might encounter other examples of the 
twisting effects of the Plane of Shadow.</span></p>
