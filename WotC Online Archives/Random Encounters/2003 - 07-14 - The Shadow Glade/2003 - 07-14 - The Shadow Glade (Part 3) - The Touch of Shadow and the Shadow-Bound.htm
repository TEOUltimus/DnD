 the mastery of shadow that they learned in perfecting the ritual that 
formed the Shadow Glade, the shadar-kai wizards also learned to bind the
 stuff of shadow to living creatures. These creatures, although not as 
powerful as shadow creatures from the Plane of Shadow, make excellent 
scouts and provide the shadar-kai with expendable troops.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 the shadar-kai wizards have used this ritual to corrupt many of the 
forest's creatures, their most powerful success came in the form of a 
group of human druids. The druids, not expecting to encounter 
spellcasters as powerful and stealthy as the shadar-kai, fell one-by-one
 to the spells of the shadow fey and then became bound to shadow itself.
 As the DM, you may determine the exact number of druids bound by the 
shadow fey. A druid who escaped the machinations of the shadar-kai would
 also make a great hook to bring the characters into conflict with the 
denizens of the Shadow Glade.</span></p>

 This druid has a brown bear as an animal companion. This creature is a 
loyal companion that accompanies the shadow-bound druid on adventures as
 appropriate for its kind. See the Monster Manual page 269 for the brown
 bear's statistics. The druid gains the following benefits.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Link with Companion (Ex):</i>
 This shadow-bound druid can handle his animal companion as a free

 Handle Animal checks made while dealing with that animal. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i>
 This shadow-bound druid may have any spell he casts on himself also 
affect his animal companion if the latter is within 5 feet at the time.

his animal companion.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b>

above).</span></p>

 In conditions other than full daylight, a shadow-bound druid can wrap

with concealment suffer a 20% miss chance (see Chapter 8: Combat in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for more information on concealment). Artificial illumination, even a <i>light</i> or <i>continual flame</i> spell, does not negate this ability. A <i>daylight</i> spell, however, will.</span></p>

 This shadow-bound druid can change into a Small or Medium animal and

noted in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> in the druid entry in Chapter 3).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b>
 This shadow-bound druid may move through natural thorns, briars,

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#000000;">Creating a Shadow-Bound Creature</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Shadow-bound"
 is an acquired template that can be added to any aberration, animal, 
dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or 
vermin.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A shadow-bound creature has all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Size and Type:</b>
 Animals and vermin with the shadow-bound template become magical beasts
 (with the augmented animal or augmented vermin subtype respectively). 
Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. All other 
types remain unchanged. The creature's size remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Special Qualities:</b> A shadow-bound creature has all the special qualities of the base creature, plus the following special qualities.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Low-Light Vision (Ex):</i> A shadow-bound creature can see twice as far as a human in dim lighting.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Shadow Blend (Su): </i>In
 conditions other than full daylight, a shadow-bound creature can wrap 
itself in shadows, giving it concealment. Attacks against a creature 
with concealment suffer a 20% miss chance (see the Chapter 8: Combat in 
the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information on concealment). Artificial illumination, even a <i>light</i> or <i>continual flame</i> spell, does not negate this ability. A <i>daylight</i> spell, however, will.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><i>Shadow Curse (Su):</i>
 The Plane of Shadow exerts a tremendous pull on shadow-bound creature's
 soul, which is only tenuously connected to its mortal body. Any time a 
shadow-bound creature is stunned, dazed, staggered, or unconscious 
(other than from natural sleep), the creature must make a Will save (DC 
15) or lose a portion of her soul to the Plane of Shadow. The 
shadow-bound creature must also attempt a save any time she removes a 
gal-ralan, if she has one (see Shadar-Kai Items, from the <i>Fiend Folio</i>).
 A shadow-bound creature with a damaged soul gains one negative level 
that cannot be removed until it restores its soul completely. If exposed
 to another event that requires a save against the shadow curse, a 
shadow-bound creature may gain additional negative levels. A 
shadow-bound creature on the Plane of Shadow can transfix her soul to 
her body again with a <i>greater restoration </i>spell. A shadow-bound creature on the Material Plane (or elsewhere) must use a <i>wish </i>or <i>miracle </i>spell
 to restore her soul. A shadow-bound creature afflicted with the shadow 
curse cannot be raised from the dead or resurrected, and it cannot gain 
experience. The touch of the shadow curse galls a shadow-bound creature,
 filling its heart with an icy emptiness that eventually drives all but 
the most determined creatures to capitulate and leave the Material Plane
 altogether. A shadow-bound creature who goes to the Plane of Shadow and
 remains there ameliorates the effects of the shadow curse and suffers 
no ill effects. However, if it leaves the Plane of Shadow without 
restoring its soul, it suffers the effects of the shadow curse until it 
returns to the Plane of Shadow or restores its soul.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Shadow Walk (Sp):</i> The shadow-bound creature can <i>shadow walk,</i>
 as the spell of the same name, except that the ability works only on 
the shadow-bound creature. Caster level equals the creature's HD.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skills:</b> A shadow-bound creature gains +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as base creature.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Alignment:</b> Same as base creature (often changes to evil)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Level Adjustment:</b> +1</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 addition to the statistics noted above, shadow-bound creatures in the 
Shadow Glade have been turned to evil and follow the instructions of the
 shadar-kai wizards at the glade's heart.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Note:</b>
 DMs making regular use of the shadow-bound template in their game 
should be prepared to quantify the ritual needed to bind a creature to 
shadow and apply the template. Characters can learn the ritual by making
 a Knowledge (the planes) check (DC 35). The day-long ritual requires 
the casting of the <i>shadow walk</i> spell by an arcane spellcaster of 
at least 9th level. The ritual requires the caster to expend 100 XP and 
must be performed in a place with a close natural connection to the 
Plane of Shadow, such as the Shadow Glade.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bringing the Parts Together</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 the taint of shadow spreads, the characters might seek to penetrate the
 depths of the Shadow Glade, encountering scouts, denizens, and the 
touch of the Plane of Shadow itself over the course of several 
adventures.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the final part of The Shadow Glade, you can confront the shadar-kai wizards lurking at the heart of the glade.</span></p>
