<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2009-02%20-%20Mind%20War%20%28Part%201%29%20-%20Arthes%20Kren_files/er_psion_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="299" width="188">Like
 many children, Arthes had an imaginary friend. He named his imaginary 
playmate Kern and took him everywhere. When his parents asked Arthes why
 only he could see this pretend being called Kern, he answered, "Because
 he lives in my shadow." His mother and father thought this was 
incredibly cute, until Arthes' shadow began to move independently of 
their son. As his frightened parents watched, the boy's shadow danced 
across the floor and turned cartwheels while young Arthes clapped his 
hands with amusement.</p>
<p class="size2">At first, his parents feared that a demonic or divine 
power might be influencing Arthes. The village priest examined Arthes as
 a candidate for possible exorcism, but he found no trace of good or 
evil divine magic in the boy. In fact, he found no trace of magic at 
all. Sorcerers and wizards examined the boy as well, trying to find an 
explanation for his seemingly strange powers. All of them were left at a
 loss. Soon, Arthes's fame grew, and spellcasters of all sorts came from
 across the world to have a look at the boy for themselves. None of them
 could devise a satisfactory explanation for the boy's abilities.</p>
<p class="size2">In the meantime, Arthes had moved beyond playing with 
shadows. On dark nights, especially when a storm was raging outside, he 
would illuminate his bedroom with a light that emanated from his own 
eyes. He moved small objects by simply wanting them to move. Arthes 
learned to keep his newfound abilities secret from his parents because 
they became uneasy when he manifested his talents.</p>
<p class="size2">Then one day, a strange sorcerer called Toryn, who had 
traveled extensively in the Underdark, came to speak with Arthes. He 
understood that the boy's powers resembled those of the squidlike beings
 called illithids (also known as mind flayers), who rule the 
subterranean realms. After meeting Arthes, Toryn no longer believed that
 the boy had any connection to the illithids -- the young man had a soul
 that was far too pure for him to have been touched by the mind flayers.
 (Not to mention, of course, that Arthes had no tentacles.) Toryn shared
 his limited knowledge of psionics with Arthes, hoping it would help the
 boy adjust to the world. As one who could naturally use arcane magic, 
Toryn could sympathize with the boy's feeling of being "different."</p>
<p class="size2">Unfortunately, Arthes's notoriety had reached even into
 the Underdark, and terrible beings focused their attention on the boy. 
Monstrous creatures descended on his parent's farm, slaughtering 
everything and everyone they found. Only the heroic effort of Arthes's 
father, supported by Toryn's powerful magic, allowed the boy to escape 
the carnage. Everyone else, even Toryn, perished.</p>
<p class="size2">Alone in the world, without family or friends, Arthes 
drifted from place to place. He always tried to hide his powers and keep
 a low profile. His psionic abilities had brought him nothing but grief 
throughout his life, and he turned his efforts to the attainment of a 
single goal: ridding himself of this psionic curse forever.</p>

cash. Arthes has the Talented feat, allowing him to manifest 3 more 
0-level powers than he otherwise would. This comes in handy when he is 
using his <i>control shadow</i> power to entertain or impress an audience. </p>
<p class="size2">Arthes is still wandering the world, searching for 
something that will rid him of his psionic abilities. He readily uses 
his powers when nobody is looking, or when he can pass it off as simple 
sleight-of-hand. He does not, however, readily admit to being a 
psionicist and goes to great lengths to hide the fact that there is 
anything "special" about him at all.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Introducing Arthes Kren to Your Campaign</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The characters encounter a wandering ascetic, who requests their 
assistance in exploring a nearby entrance to the Underdark. The ascetic 
is Arthes Kern, who hopes to find some traces of an illithid settlement 
he believes was once located in the Underdark of this area. Through the 
illithid's psionic knowledge, he hopes to find a way to rid himself of 
his curse forever. He does not readily display his psionic powers, and 
he attempts to hide his true purpose from the PCs. If hard pressed, he 
tries to pass himself off as a "sorcerer."<br><br></li>
<li>The characters happen upon a mob, led by a cleric of Hextor, who are
 attempting to burn a young man at the stake. This young man is Arthes 
Kern, and, when the PCs investigate, they find that the cleric of Hextor
 is attempting to destroy him because he is clearly an "agent of chaos."
 His psionic powers do not fit into any established ideas of magic or 
reality, therefore he must be eliminated before he can undermine the 
"natural order of things." Should the characters free Arthes, he 
explains his psionic talents to them, as well as his quest to be rid of 
them. Should the characters not choose to free Arthes, he frees himself 
using a combination of <i>mass concussion</i> and <i>control flames</i> -- more power than he normally would expend in the presence of witnesses, but his circumstances are clearly desperate.<br><br></li>
<li>Arthes believes that one of the PCs may hold the key to ridding 
himself of his psionic abilities -- either in a magic artifact they 
possess or in something they might know. He approaches them discreetly 
and tries to gain their assistance. If the PCs don't agree to help him, 
he might try to use force to persuade them.</li>

<p class="size2">Although random encounters usually happen by chance, 
some DMs may wish to tie these four parts together into something that 
could lead to further adventures. Future parts of this Random Encounter 
series will contain brief notes on how to tie them all together.</p>
