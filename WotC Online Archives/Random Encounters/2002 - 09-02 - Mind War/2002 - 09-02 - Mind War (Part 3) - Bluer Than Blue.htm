 are generally not impressive creatures. They are short, weak, 
foul-tempered, and cowardly. If not for their great numbers and 
incredible fecundity, the other humanoid races would have wiped them out
 long ago.</p>
<p class="size2">But some goblins are born different than their brethren
 -- with blue-tinged skin, smooth foreheads, and a strange gleam of 
intelligence in their eyes. These goblins are known simply as "blues." 
Many are destroyed at birth, since goblins fear and loathe that which 
they do not understand. (Goblins fear and loathe a <i>lot</i> of 
things.) But some survive to adulthood, becoming paragons of their race 
and an unanticipated threat to other humanoid and goblinoid races.</p>
<p class="size2">Few have studied the blues in depth, and a lot of 
disagreement exists about their origins and means of creation. Some say 
they are the chosen sons of Magubliyet, who have been set by the goblin 
deity to ensure that his followers hold dominion over the world. Others 
say these goblins are throwbacks to a long forgotten time when psionic 
goblins were the world's dominant race, before their strange and evil 
experiments sent their entire species spinning into the forms they exist
 in today. Still others say the blues represent the next step in the 
growth of goblin-kind.</p>
<p class="size2">Lolo Binqi is once such goblin. Born to the favored 
mate of the leader of his tribe, he found himself protected from the 
quick death that the tribe members intended for him because of his 
strange appearance. Thus shielded from infanticide, Lolo grew up on the 
fringes of goblin society. Weak and small, even by goblin standards, 
Lolo would have been the frequent target of abuse, were it not for the 
strange powers he began to manifest. One bully who thought Lolo would be
 an easy target found his hair set on fire. Others learned to give the 
blue goblin a wide berth.</p>
<p class="size2">Soon, Lolo took to amusing his peers by setting other 
goblins on fire. He quickly attracted a wide following among the tribe 
members, and, when his father died, Lolo immediately moved to seize 
power. Once his grip on leadership of the tribe was solid, Lolo first 
moved to collect all the blues born to those under his command. Though 
blue births are infrequent, the goblin species' high birth rate allowed 
Lolo to collect a considerable number of blue offspring from his tribe. 
Freed from the threat of infanticide, these children trained to become 
Lolo's personal guards.</p>
<p class="size2">Now, surrounded by a private force of psionic goblins, 
Lolo Binqi is turning his eye toward conquest. He believes that the 
blues are the key to his plans of world domination, and he intends to 
first unite all goblin tribes under his banner so he can protect their 
psionic offspring and bring them into his psionic army. Then he intends 
to conquer the other goblinoid races. Surely, he reasons, the orcs and 
hobgoblins must have others like him, who are used to being ostracized 
and bullied because of their special gifts. These psionic goblinoids, 
Lolo reasons, will flock to him because of the power and acceptance he 
offers, and the goblinoid tribes will collapse before the might of his 
psionic armies. Then, there will be only the small matter of the 
humanoids -- the hated elves, dwarves, humans, gnomes and halflings -- 
standing between him and total control of the known world.</p>

<p class="size2">Lolo Binqi is short by goblin standards, and he does 
not like to be reminded of this. Those who call attention to his 
diminutive stature frequently find that they've been set afire by Lolo's
 psionic power. Lolo has not been content to simply focus on psionic 
study, but he has also delved into strategy and military history in 
preparation for his world conquest. He is self-confident to the point of
 arrogance, and he has begun to believe that it is his destiny to unite 
the world under his rule. Unfortunately for the world, the might of his 
psions and the brutality of his numerous goblin legions might give him 
the power he needs to make this "destiny" come true.As a psion Lolo may 
activate psionic combat modes and manifest powers that he knows as 
usual. In addition he retains his spell-like abilities for being a blue.
 These abilities are kept track of seperately. Lolo may not use power 
points to activate these psionic combat modes or to manifest these 
powers unless he also knows them through his experience as a psion.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Introducing Lolo Binqi to Your Campaign</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A squad of goblins, led by a strange creature with blue skin that 
looks vaguely goblinoid, ambushes the characters. This creature is 
Cartak Narg, one of Lolo's lieutenants, who is stealing gemstones from 
travelers in the area. The goblins are using these gemstones to create 
psionic weapons that Lolo will use to arm his forces in his upcoming 
conflict. The PCs may discover this plan and probably want to stop it.<br><br></li>
<li>Rumors of a terrible goblin wizard from the barren lands abound. 
This wizard, known only as Binqi the Blue, is raising an army of goblins
 to take over the known world. Many adventurers have gone in search of 
this wizard, hoping to learn more of his plans and how to defeat them. 
None have returned.<br><br></li>
<li>The characters encounter a well-organized goblin army on the march 
that is led by strange goblinoid creatures wearing black robes. There 
are too many goblins for the characters to fight openly, but they may 
wish to warn nearby towns and villages that a goblinoid legion is 
marching against them. Lolo Binqi, who rides in a palanquin guarded by a
 squad of psionic goblins and four psionic bugbears, leads the army. He 
has succeeded in uniting the goblinoids under him in sufficient numbers 
to confidently move against the humans. The PCs will be hard-pressed to 
find a way to stop him.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">You have several options available to you regarding how
 to bring this part into the other two. As the PCs seek out the remnants
 of the mindknights with Arthes or join up with a remaining member of 
the mindknights, they may find themselves facing Binqi's troops. This 
could eventually lead to a greater confrontation.</p>
