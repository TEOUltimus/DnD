<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p class="size2">The illithids and their enemies have created many 
powerful weapons over the centuries. One such artifact is the Annulus, 
which is a terrifying artifact that can reduce psionic beings to ashes 
(see the <i>Psionics Handbook, </i>page 137). Another artifact is the 
Mindscraper, which is a horrible device that threatens psionic and 
nonpsionic beings alike. Many of these weapons have been lost to the 
flow of centuries, as the illithids retreated into the far reaches of 
the Underdark and their former slave races -- the githyanki and 
githzerai (see the <i>Psionics Handbook, </i>pages 147-149) -- dispersed
 through Limbo and the Astral Plane. Should one of these weapons 
resurface, however, an event of interplanar significance could take 
place. Old hatred and ancient wars could take form, new legends might be
 written, and the foundations of reality could shake as every powerful 
psionic being and race scrambled to make the ancient weapon their own.</p>
<p class="size2">Illithids first forged the Mindscraper before the hero 
Gith overthrew their empire, before mortals called them "mind flayers", 
and before they took up residence in the Underdark. It is made of an 
unknown blue metal that bears some resemblance to ferroplasm (see the <i>Psionics Handbook</i>,
 page 138). When the Mindscraper is not held by a being with psionic 
powers, it dissolves into a puddle of silver goo and loses all its 
abilities. Only when grasped by a psionic being does it reshape itself 
into its true form: a small knife of the sort that might be used to 
scrape animal hide in preparation for tanning and curing. The 
Mindscraper serves a similar purpose: It "cleans" a mortal being of his 
or her identity so he or she will be a useful tool for the wielder of 
the weapon.</p>
<p class="size2">Activation of the Mindscraper's powers requires that 
the wielder hold it like a melee weapon. The Mindscraper floods the mind
 of its wielder with its powers when grasped this way for the first 
time. In combat, the Mindscraper functions as a <i>+5</i><i>dagger of body feeding</i> (see the <i>Psionics Handbook</i>, page 126).</p>
<p class="size2">The wielder of the Mindscraper can manifest the <i>psychic vampire</i>
 power at will as if a 20th-level psion. This power allows the wielder 
to drain up to 40 power points from a victim with a successful touch 
attack. The wielder, however, can never gain more power points than he 
or she would normally get in a day with a single attack. Against 
nonpsionic beings or psionic beings who have no power points left, this 
attack deals 1 point of temporary Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 
damage. The wielder gains 1 power point from such an attack. The 
illithid who created it always kept many slaves nearby to serve as an 
easy source of psionic energy to tap into if he ever needed it.</p>
<p class="size2">The wielder can also manifest the following powers up to 3 times/day each as a 20th-level psion: <i>domination</i>, <i>forced mindlink</i>, and <i>mindwipe</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">Once a week, the wielder of the Mindscraper can manifest <i>thrall</i>. The illithid who created this artifact maintained his stable of slaves through frequent use of this power.</p>
<p class="size2">Finally, the wielder of the Mindscraper can manifest the power <i>mind store</i>
 with the Mindscraper substituting for the storage crystal. If the 
wielder chooses to do this, the wielder's soul is transferred into the 
Mindscraper at the point of his or her physical death. The Mindscraper 
uses the wielder's psionic energy to maintain its shape and does not 
revert to a pile of goo while it holds the wielder's soul -- even if 
wielded by a being without psionic powers. So long as the wielder's soul
 is embedded in the Mindscraper, the artifact will not manifest any of 
its other powers. The wielder has 30 days to grow a new physical body as
 per the <i>mind store</i> spell before his or her living essence 
dissipates forever. Nobody knows whether the illithid who created this 
artifact attempted to invoke this power, but he was almost certainly 
unsuccessful if he did.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Destruction: </b>The Mindscraper can be destroyed only while a soul is embedded in it through its <i>mind store</i>
 power. While thus inhabited by a living soul, the Mindscraper must be 
brought to the lich-queen of the githyanki, who alone among 
non-illithids knows the secret psionic geometries that will undo this 
artifact. The lich-queen must be shown that this is in her best 
interest, however, or she may try to take possession of the Mindscraper 
for herself. Of course, the illithids also know of this secret, but they
 generally prefer to keep the Mindscraper in existence.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Introducing the Mindscraper to Your Campaign</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A wizard with an interest in psionic creatures and artifacts has 
discovered an ancient tome that tells the history of the mind flayers. 
In this tome, the wizard has read of an ancient artifact that was used 
to enslave entire races of beings. He wishes to know whether such a 
thing could still exist and enlists the PCs to go looking for traces of 
it, starting with an old illithid settlement that is mentioned in the 
tome. This settlement is deep in the Underdark, and illithids may still 
inhabit it.<br><br></li>
<li>Cartak Narg, lieutenant of Lolo Binqi the goblin psion, seeks a 
powerful artifact that will allow him to overthrow his short, arrogant 
leader and usurp the control of the goblin army for himself. He contacts
 the PCs hoping to form a temporary alliance with them to search for the
 artifact. He tells the PCs anything he must to gain their cooperation, 
even trying to persuade them that he wants to prevent the goblin tribes 
from going to war.<br><br></li>
<li>Illithid have been sighted in parts of the Underdark far closer to 
the surface than normal, accompanied by numerous servant creatures. They
 seem to be searching for something. In fact, the illithids and their 
servants are looking for traces of ancient artifacts near several early 
mind flayer settlements. They are close to discovering several important
 clues to the location of the Mindscraper and may even find the artifact
 if the PCs do not act to prevent them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">As mentioned in the bulleted list above, it's possible 
that one of Binqi's followers may wish to find the Mindscraper for his 
personal use. If so, the PCs may find themselves, along with Arthes, 
trying to prevent the goblins from gaining possession of the artifact 
even as they seek to prevent Binqi's troops from gaining ascendancy in 
the area.</p>
