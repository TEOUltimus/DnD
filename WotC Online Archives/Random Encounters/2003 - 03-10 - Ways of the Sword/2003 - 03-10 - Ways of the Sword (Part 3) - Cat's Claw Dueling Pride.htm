<p class="size2"><b>Cat's Claw Dueling Pride</b></p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2003%20-%2003-10%20-%20Ways%20of%20the%20Sword%20%28Part%203%29%20-%20Cat%27s%20Claw%20Dueling%20Pride_files/re_0203_cats_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="231" width="237">In
 a remote part of the city, near its edge, one finds what appears to be a
 zoo or animal farm. Its sign boasts that it is the Cat's Claw Dueling 
Pride, and an inquirer would find that it is in fact a school of dueling
 rather than just a club. Within, students learn the ways of fighting 
like a cat, but with the rapier or longsword.</p>
<p class="size2">The owner of this school, and its chief teacher, is a 
man who is fascinated with, and obsessed with, cats. Thus, all kinds of 
cats populate Miromar's school beside the humanoid occupants. The cats 
are friendly toward Miromar, who is a catlord, but not so much with the 
students. This, and city laws, requires that the felines be caged. 
However, there is a large open field where they spend much of their 
time, safely separated from the city's population.</p>
<p class="size2">Their presence is necessary to teach the students. When
 students come to the school, they are let loose in the field with the 
large cats. Those who flee or show fear are dismissed. The ones that 
stay are enrolled as kittens and spend their first years studying the 
animals and how they move, and trying to emulate the cats. When Miromar 
has decided that they have succeeded, the student graduates to the 
second level of training, swordcats. At this level they study fencing 
techniques and merge them with the cat movements they learned as 
kittens. Students more interested in the cats than in fighting are 
trained in a different part of the school to take up the mantle of 
catlord.</p>
<p class="size2">Students that pass the second level of training in 
either discipline are graduated to the rank of catclaw, the highest 
level a student achieves in this school. These students master the 
intricacies of whichever path they have chosen and gain experience in 
the world by going on "quests" for the school or for Miromar personally.
 These "quests" are chosen for their likelihood of reinforcing training 
and of causing the student to use his or her training in new ways. Once 
the students are deemed ready, they are given an examination. If they 
pass it, they graduate from the school.</p>
<p class="size2">Students of the Cat's Claw frequently get into trouble,
 as the ways of a cat are individualistic and contrary. Miromar sees the
 students who get into trouble as the most like cats, and therefore the 
most praiseworthy, so long as they were not trying specifically to get 
into trouble. A cat will sometimes do something because it is wrong, but
 most often will just do something because it wants to. That is the 
attitude that Miromar would like to see developed in his students. Thus,
 many of his students come to have a chaotic neutral alignment by the 
time they graduate.</p>
<p class="size2">Like the Way of the Flashing Blade, Miromar employs a 
wizard to develop spells and potions for the students. He got the idea 
from Tendra's practice, but claims it is his own. Potions are sold to 
students and the public, but the spells are not taught to other wizards.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Feline Distraction<br></b>Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time: </b>1 action<br><b>Range: </b>Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Target:</b> One creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will negates (harmless)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Feline distraction</i> causes the target to become 
afflicted with a cat's curiosity for the irrelevant. The target ignores 
opponents or real threats in favor of chasing motes of dust, insects, or
 imagined small objects (or even performing multiple gravity experiments
 with various objects by knocking them off their resting spot and onto 
the floor). Roll on the following table:</p>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p class="size2">Except on a result of 1, roll again each round to see 
what the subject does that round. Attackers are not at any special 
advantage when attacking a subject. Behavior is checked at the beginning
 of the subject's turn. Any distracted creature who is attacked 
automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn.</p>
<p class="size2">The material component is a piece of string, which the caster waves at the target.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Bringing the Parts Together</b></p>
<p class="size2">Aside from becoming involved with the dueling pride 
through its conflicts with the Way of the Flashing Blade Academy, the 
characters might come here to learn the animal lord (cat) prestige 
class, pick up some druid lore, or learn the ways of the arcane duelist 
prestige class. It might be a place to rest for the night. The 
characters might be hired to escort some beginning students on a trip to
 interact with wild beasts or to take a message for the pride to some 
ally in a distant land.</p>
