 two dueling schools are the products of their creators' visions, and 
neither would survive the demise of its creator for very long. The Way 
of the Flashing Blade Academy might last longer, but would devolve in 
the face of conflicts between the masters without Maralis's strong hand.
 And the Cat's Pride would disband almost immediately with the loss of 
its leader, Miromar.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tendra Maralis, Master of the Way of the Flashing Blade</b></p>
<p class="size2">Tendra Maralis did not begin her career on the path of 
the duelist. Instead, she began as a street rogue. Abandoned by her 
parents when she was five years old (because they were killed by a rival
 thieves guild), she was raised by other street people and taught the 
arts of theft. Before she had become too entangled in the life of a 
thief to escape, she fell in love with a soldier and went with him on 
his campaign as a camp follower. During this experience, she learned to 
fight and enjoyed that far more than stealing. In fighting, she could 
prove her worth without causing another to suffer much loss. She was 
eventually taken into the army during that campaign because of losses 
suffered, and she made quite a name for herself. She made such a name 
for herself that her paramour ended their relationship out of jealousy. 
The idea of dueling had appealed strongly to her throughout her 
training, and when she returned from the campaign she sought out 
duelists to teach her the art.</p>
<p class="size2">Years later, she is now a master duelist and trains 
others in the art. Because of the street people who raised her, she sees
 the students as children of sorts, even the oldest ones. She requires 
that they all obey the rules of the school, but within that boundary 
treats them very well. She knows that laws and rules exist for a reason,
 and she tries to show her students what those reasons are. She believes
 people are more likely to obey rules for which they understand the 
reasons, and in general she has been proven correct.</p>
<p class="size2">Because of her lawful approach, she has stylistic 
differences with Miromar of the Cat's Claw, and with most people who 
approach dueling in a casual or chaotic way. Her more personal conflict 
with Miromar dates back to her days in the army (the exact details have 
been left for you to fit into your campaign). While she and Miromar are 
not bitter rivals, they are antagonistic toward each other and the 
students amplify that when they meet.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Acrobatic Attack (Ex):</b> If Tendra attacks by 
jumping at least 5 feet toward her opponent, jumping down at least 5 
feet onto her opponent, or swinging on a rope or similar object into her
 opponent, she gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls. A Jump check
 success of at least 5 feet is required to use this ability on any given
 attack. If the distance is greater than that between Tendra and her 
opponent, she can limit the distance to that of the opponent as a free 
action.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Canny Defense:</b> When not wearing armor, Tendra 
adds her Intelligence bonus to her Dexterity bonus to modify Armor Class
 while wielding a melee weapon. If she is caught flat-footed or 
otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus. This 
adjustment is already included in the statistics above.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Enhanced Mobility:</b> When unarmored, Tendra gains 
an additional +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when 
she moves out of or within a threatened area (stacks with the +4 bonus 
for the Mobility feat).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If exposed to any effect that 
normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, Tendra takes no damage with a successful saving throw.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Grace:</b> Tendra gains an additional +2 competence 
bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This ability functions only when she 
is wearing no armor. This adjustment is already included in the 
statistics given above.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Precise Strike (Ex):</b> Tendra can strike precisely
 with a one-handed piercing weapon, gaining a bonus 2d6 points of damage
 on her normal damage roll. When making a precise strike, she cannot 
attack with a weapon in her other hand, although she can defend with it 
(or, if she has the proficiency, a buckler). Tendra's precise strike 
works only against living creatures with discernable anatomies. Any 
creature that is immune to critical hits (including undead, constructs, 
oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures) is not vulnerable to a precise
 strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical 
hits (such as armor with fortification) also protects a creature from a 
precise strike.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Elaborate Parry (Ex):</b> If Tendra chooses to fight
 defensively or use all-out defense in melee combat, she gains an 
additional +7 dodge bonus to her AC.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Miromar the Striped, Leader of the Cat's Claw Dueling Pride</b></p>
<p class="size2">Children tend to select a favorite animal as they grow 
up and to prefer things relating to that animal over all others. Bears, 
cats, dogs, birds, dolphins; whatever the choice, the child loves its 
chosen animal. In the case of Miromar of Elbern, cats were his favorite.
 They were his life, as it were, and he went so far as to have tiger 
stripes tattooed across his body when he left his family's home. The 
call of nature took strong hold of him as a youth, and he began his 
studies to become a druid as soon as he was old enough.</p>
<p class="size2">While a student druid, he learned about a different 
path that would let him be with his cherished tigers and lions and 
panthers. He did not really enjoy all the aspects of druidhood as he 
thought he would, so he embarked upon a path that led to becoming a 
catlord. But that alone did not hold his interest; as he learned to 
fight, he, too, was attracted to the way of dueling. For him, however, 
the fusion of the cat nature and the duelist is what attracted him, and 
it led him to his eventual profession as master of a duelist school 
built around the feline way of being. </p>
<p class="size2">To have set his school in the same city as Tendra 
Maralis he found to be an unlucky chance, but then even black cats are 
not immune to bad luck. He made the best of it, but found himself in 
confrontations with Maralis periodically over style (her more rigid 
style against his more freeform style) and an old grievance from the 
days when they both served in the war and she outshone just about every 
other soldier in the ranks (himself included). Thus, he is antagonistic 
toward her in public and private, but also strangely attracted to her. 
He attributes the attraction to some catlike feeling of contrariness, 
but he cannot ignore it. He doubts she is aware of his interest.</p>
<p class="size2">Miromar trains his students to be catlords or arcane 
duelists. He does not train in the duelist prestige class, since he 
never learned the skills that make Tendra Maralis the good fighter she 
is. He relies on trickery and his catlike speed to emulate the same 
skills. His students like the freeform, almost chaotic style, and he 
thinks they become accomplished fighters. In reality, they are only as 
good as the students of the Way of the Flashing Blade because of the 
tricks they learn to keep one step ahead of skilled fighters.</p>

Defiance*, Dodge, Mobility, Off-Hand Parry*, Skill Focus (Move 
Silently), Track, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse (rapier).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Bond:</b> Miromar has a bond with all natural
 felines. Because of this bond, all felines automatically have a 
friendly attitude toward him. Animal bond also allows him to have one or
 more feline animal companions (as the druid's <i>animal friendship</i> spell) that total a maximum of 10 Hit Dice. He can train these animal companions just as a druid does.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Companion:</b> Miromar may have one or more animal companions. These animals are those that he has befriended with the spell <i>animal friendship.</i> The total Hit Dice of all animal companions at a time may not exceed 3.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Animal Farspeech</i> (Sp):</b> Miromar can use his animal speech ability to converse telepathically with any feline that he can sense with animal sense. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Sense (Su):</b> Miromar can sense felines in a radius of 25 miles. This ability does not allow him to communicate with the animals he senses. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Speech (Ex):</b> Miromar can converse at will with any natural feline as though a <i>speak with animals</i> spell were in effect. The creatures' responses, of course, are limited by their intelligence and perceptions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Apparent Defense (Ex):</b> Due to his trickery and 
force of personality, Miromar adds his Charisma bonus (+2) to his Armor 
Class, in addition to his Dexterity bonus. Conditions that cause Miromar
 to lose his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class also cause him to lose this 
bonus. This adjustment is already figured into the statistics above.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Chosen Weapon:</b> Miromar can imbue a rapier with 
powers to make himself appear more skilled. If that rapier is lost, he 
may choose another, but it takes seven days for a chosen weapon to bond 
to him so that it can be imbued with abilities.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dexterous Attack (Ex):</b> Because Miromar values 
successful hits over actual damage dealt, he can subtract an amount from
 his rapier's potential damage and add the same amount to his attack 
bonus. However, the weapon must do a minimum 1 point of damage. Miromar 
declares this power before rolling his attack, and the amount subtracted
 cannot exceed his base attack bonus.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Enchant Chosen Weapon (Ex):</b> Miromar's rapier 
acts as if it has a +1 enhancement bonus, even though it does not. This 
class-granted bonus works for Miromar only when wielding his rapier.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>First Totem:</b> Miromar has Skill Focus (Move Silently) as a bonus feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Lesser Wild Shape</i> (Sp):</b> Miromar can wild shape into any natural feline. This ability otherwise functions exactly like the druid's <i>wild shape</i> ability, except that he can use it as often as desired.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Nature Sense:</b> Miromar can identify plants and 
animals (their species and special traits) with perfect accuracy. He can
 determine whether water is safe to drink or dangerous.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Second Totem:</b> Once per hour, Miromar can use the extraordinary ability to move at ten times his normal speed as a charge action.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Share Lesser Form</i> (Sp):</b> Miromar can share
 whichever animal form he is currently using with up to five willing 
individuals. This effect is identical to that of the <i>polymorph other</i> spell, except that its duration is 5 hours.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Summon Animal</i> (Sp):</b> Miromar can summon 1d3 felines once per day as though using the appropriate <i>summon nature's ally </i>spell, except that the duration is 5 rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trackless Step:</b> Miromar leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Woodland Stride:</b> Miromar may move through 
natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his 
normal speed and without suffering damage or other impairment. However, 
thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically 
manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Lord Spells Prepared</b> (2/2; save DC 12 + spell level): 1st -- <i>camouflage*, cure light wounds;</i> 2nd -- <i>adrenaline surge*, cure moderate wounds.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Druid Spells Prepared</b> (4/3/2; save DC 12 + spell level): 0 -- <i>cure minor wounds, mending, virtue</i> (2); 1st -- <i>cure light wounds, faerie fire, magic fang; </i>2nd -- <i>decomposition*, speed of the wind*.</i></p>

<p class="size2">Feats from <i>Masters of the Wild</i>:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Control:</b> You can rebuke or command 
creatures of the animal type as an evil cleric rebukes undead. To 
command an animal, you must be able to speak with it via a <i>speak with animals</i>
 effect, though you may issue your commands mentally if desired. The 
number of times per day that you can use this ability is equal to 3 + 
your Charisma modifier. Your highest caster level is the level at which 
you rebuke animals. Animals you command through this ability count 
against the HD limit of animals you can befriend through <i>animal friendship.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Animal Defiance: </b>You can turn (but not destroy) 
creatures of the animal type as a good cleric turns undead. The number 
of times per day that you can use this ability is equal to 3 + your 
Charisma modifier. Your highest caster level is the level at which you 
turn animals.</p>
<p class="size2">Feats from <i>Sword and Fist</i>:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Off-hand Parry:</b> When fighting with two weapons 
and using the full attack action, on your action you can decide to 
attack normally or to sacrifice all your off-hand attacks for the round 
in exchange for a +2 dodge bonus to your AC. If you are also using a 
buckler, its AC bonus stacks. You can use only bladed or hafted weapons 
of a size category smaller than you with this feat.</p>
