 hoping this column becomes your window into roleplaying design and 
development -- or at least the way we approach these things here at 
Wizards of the Coast. We'll handle a wide range of topics in weeks to 
come, from frank discussions about over- or underpowered material, to 
the design goals of a certain supplement, to what we think are the next 
big ideas for the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> game. All of this comes bundled with a healthy look at the people and events that are roleplaying R&amp;D.</p>
<p align="left">Dave Noonan starts an examination of adventure design concerning his own future adventure.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><i>Wherein Dave uses the word “verisimilitude” no less than six times… counting that one.</i></p>
<p align="left">My current project is adventure design—specifically a 
sizeable adventure for low- to mid-level characters. For the last few 
months, I’ve been doing the nitty-gritty work of designing rooms, 
statting up NPCs, and figuring out whether the pit should be 40 feet 
deep or 30 feet with spikes along the bottom.</p>
<p align="left">I’ve found that adventure design demands a much tighter focus than sourcebook and rules design. When I’m writing something like <i>Dungeon Master’s Guide</i> or <i>Heroes of Battle</i>,
 I spend most of my time creating tools. As I tap away on my trusty 
laptop, I’m saying: “Here are some teamwork benefits—go ahead and have 
fun with these.” When I describe some mysterious monster underneath Lake
 Dark in Karrnath, I’m saying, “Go forth and make a cool adventure out 
of this.”</p>
<p align="left">But when I’m writing an adventure, I’m not creating 
tools anymore. I’m employing them. As I type away, I’m no longer 
imagining a vast audience of <b>D&amp;D</b> players who’ll use the tools we make in countless different ways. I’m imagining one table of friends playing <b>D&amp;D</b>, and I’m trying to craft great <b>D&amp;D</b> sessions for those five guys.</p>
<p align="left">So my focus lately hasn’t been on the grand issues of the <b>D&amp;D</b> hobby (see the “<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060127a">Flow at the D&amp;D Table</a>” column a few weeks ago for that), but rather on the little elements that I’m trying to shape into a fun <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure. These are tiny issues, but they’re reflective of the tight focus that adventure design demands.</p>
<p align="left">What follows are some notes that I’ve collected as I 
worked my through this adventure—prettied up, of course. Seeing me 
scribble “<i>Drowses! We hates them, we does</i>!” might be entertaining, but it isn’t exactly illuminating.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>The Keys to a Good Adventure</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td><b>A True-type R&amp;D Confession: </b>Throughout the 30-year history of <b>D&amp;D</b>, we’ve uniformly done a terrible job with locks. Open any <b>D&amp;D</b>
 adventure, and I’ll bet you find a bunch of locked doors, locked 
chests, chained-up prisoners, etc. Now find the keys for all those 
locks… not so easy, is it? Usually, they just aren’t there. As adventure
 designers, we’ve put the lock in there as a minor obstacle—something 
that will require a skill check, maybe alert the monsters on the other 
side of the door, etc. But once we’ve designed our little obstacle, we 
don’t pay attention to verisimilitude. We never take the time to give 
the NPCs the keys they’d need to move around their own living quarters 
and get the stuff out of their own chests.</td>

</tbody></table><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Small%20-%20Adventure%20Design,%20Part%201_files/designdev_lock.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">Well,
 that problem ends with this adventure. The locks have keys—and we tell 
you where the key is in the description of every lock. And when the 
players find a key, the adventure tells the DM what lock it opens. It’s a
 little thing, but it’s overdue. When my playtest group started saying 
things like “Wow, we’re finding a lot of keys,” I knew I was onto 
something good.</p>
<p align="left">Once I committed to a “key for every lock” philosophy, I
 found I needed to stretch verisimilitude a little. Think about where 
your house keys are. For probably half the day, they’re inside your 
house. That’s realistic, but it’s dissatisfying for the players to 
repeatedly beat down a locked door, take out the bad guys, and only then
 get the keys that would have opened the lock. So I found myself 
inventing reasons why there’s a monster in room A3 whose pocket has the 
key to a chest in room A6. It’s pretty easy to come up with those 
reasons, but taking that little bit of extra time makes for more 
satisfying verisimilitude. Depending on how the PCs explore the 
adventure site, they might get the key first, in which case they’ll feel
 smart when they use it on the chest. Or maybe they’ll find the chest 
first and bash it open. Then if they later get the key, they still feel 
smart for having figured out how the world works—even if their 
cleverness arrived too late to actually help.</p>
<p align="left">For the record, there’s one exception in this adventure.
 There are a few rooms occupied by monsters that aren’t exactly the 
original builders. Those doors have locks, but the monsters don’t use 
them, because they don’t have the keys.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Monster Response</b></p>
<p align="left">Three main adventure sites comprise my adventure. 
Without getting into too much plot detail, suffice it to say that the 
sites have historical links with each other, but the current inhabitants
 of the three sites don’t share those links.</p>
<p align="left">Three disparate monster groupings gave me the chance to 
play with some different choices for how monsters respond to PCs 
invading their homes.</p>
<p align="left">In real life, if you attack a site full of armed, 
dangerous people, the entirety of them will respond—probably 
overwhelmingly, and probably right at the entrance. But that rarely 
makes for a satisfying <b>D&amp;D</b> game. First, PCs don’t feel a 
sense of progression when they’re fighting battle after battle in room 
A1, not exploring the entire adventure site. Second, the PCs don’t get 
to make interesting noncombat decisions—the “left door or right door” 
sorts of questions. Third, a dungeon that empties out in response to a 
PC attack starts to feel like a random monster generator.</p><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Small%20-%20Adventure%20Design,%20Part%201_files/designdev_cato.jpg" align="right" border="0"><blockquote><b>DM:</b> This round, the north door opens and a…[rolls dice]… catoblepas comes through.<br><b>Player:</b> You didn’t have a lot of prep time this week, did you?</blockquote>
<p align="left">(I should note that once in a great while, you can get away with waves of monsters entering the same room. You can get a good <i>Shaka Zulu</i> thing going, but it’s tiresome when repeated too often.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Minimal Monster Response</b><br>Even if the “everyone rush to the entrance” defense plan doesn’t make for a good <b>D&amp;D</b>
 adventure, you still have a lot of tools for monster response. My three
 sites take three different approaches. The first site, populated by 
creatures that are ot-nay oo-tay ight-bray, is intentionally designed 
with minimal monster response. If the creatures in room A2 hear a battle
 in room in A1, they shrug and go back to their porridge, because fights
 in room A1 happen all the time. There are some built-in exceptions, but
 most of the first site is built to be explored piecemeal. What happens 
in room A1 stays in room A1. Given that this low-level site will have 
players still getting used to what their PCs can do, it’s useful to keep
 it simple—a sort of “shakedown cruise” to start a new campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Individual Alert</b><br>The second site has smarter 
denizens, but they don’t necessarily get along all that well with one 
another. So I can introduce a second sort of monster response: 
individual alert. When the creatures in room B2 hear a fight in room B1,
 they get out their weapons, start casting spells, and otherwise hunker 
down and get ready for a fight. But they stay put, and they don’t spread
 the news throughout the rest of the site.</p>
<p align="left">An “individual alert” monster response system does a 
couple of nice things for an encounter. First, it lets the NPCs use more
 complex tactics and employ some basic preparation magic—they get to be 
more interesting bad guys. Second, it rewards players who can use 
stealth or speed to overwhelm the bad guys in room B1. If they can 
dispatch the enemies in room B1 quickly, they’re rewarded with 
unprepared enemies in room B2. The individual alerts have good 
verisimilitude for the players (they see the consequences of making 
noise or being stealthy), but the PCs still get the fun of exploring 
each room in turn, dealing with it, then moving on.</p>
<p align="left"><b>General Alert</b><br><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Small%20-%20Adventure%20Design,%20Part%201_files/designdev_response.jpg" align="right" border="0">By
 the time the PCs reach the third site, the players are more comfortable
 with their characters, and the DM knows more of what they’re capable. 
And the third site has a (mostly) unified group of intelligent 
creatures, so I can take monster response to the “general alert” level.</p>
<p align="left">Now monsters in room C2 can put a good chunk of the site
 on alert when they hear the battle in room C1. Players will have to 
deal with monsters that have been alerted, patrols that the bad-guy 
leadership sends in response to “trouble at the gates,” and so on. The 
verisimilitude is really good. The players get a profound “we just 
kicked over an anthill” sense once they realize that the whole site 
knows that it’s under attack.</p>
<p align="left">But general alerts are more work for the DM, who has to 
manage roving patrols and have a keen sense of timing. All of sudden, 
questions like “how long does it take the guards in room C4 to put on 
their armor, talk to the guys in room C5, then head to room C1?” matter a
 lot more. And DMs already have a lot to keep track of, so it takes some
 careful design to make general alert monster response work. You want to
 craft a general alert that feels realistic to the players, but not one 
that throws the whole adventure site into chaos with monsters running 
from room to room. If the monster response is too complex, then you’re 
basically telling the DM: “Redesign this dungeon on the fly, please.”</p>
<p align="left">Individual alerts and general alerts are more work for 
the adventure designer, too, because you’re designing each encounter 
twice: once with monsters going about their daily business and once with
 alerted monsters. Both encounters have to be interesting—and you 
probably need to fit them both on the same page. But there’s a big 
payoff for all that work. The DM can glance down at the adventure, 
quickly scan what it says in the “if the monsters are alerted” box, and 
run the encounter with confidence that it’ll feel realistic to the PCs.</p><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Small%20-%20Adventure%20Design,%20Part%201_files/designdev_trap.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p class="size4" align="left"><b>Reactive Traps</b></p>
<p align="left">All told, this adventure will have something like eighty encounters. But there’s one staple <b>D&amp;D</b> challenge that I’m skipping entirely: the hidden trap that goes off without warning… the booby-trap that PCs just react to.</p>
<p align="left">You know the type. It’s the poison needle that jabs the rogue picking the lock. It’s the <i>explosive runes</i> on the last page of the book. It’s the <i>slay living</i> spell that goes off whenever someone touches the door of the mausoleum.</p>
<p align="left">I think these traps are fundamentally dissatisfying. Look at it from the player’s point of view.</p>
<blockquote><b>Player:</b> I go listen at the door.<br><b>DM:</b> As you move down the corridor, it fills with caustic gas. Make a Fortitude save.<br><b>Player:</b> [Rolls.] An 18.<br><b>DM:</b>
 Not good enough. Take… [rolls]… 22 points of damage as you choke your 
way through the gas cloud. Now you’re at the door. Make that Listen 
check…</blockquote>
<p align="left">From the player’s point of view, he tried to do 
something ordinary, and he took damage for it. He eventually got to do 
what he wanted to do all along. He just took a little damage and earned 
some XP along the way. It’s almost entirely a mechanical transaction—no 
decisions involved. The trap’s only function in the overall adventure is
 to provide some minor attrition.</p>
<p align="left">Worse, the whole table pays a penalty for that minor 
attrition. Now the PCs start taking 20 on every Search check. They 
develop elaborate operating procedures for opening a door. The pace of 
the game slows to a crawl. I ask myself this: Given that you have a 
finite amount of time at the <b>D&amp;D</b> table with your friends, how much of that time do you want to devote to door-opening?</p>
<p align="left">Does that mean no traps? Hardly. It means traps that 
feel like encounters, where the PCs work their way past them on a 
round-by-round basis. It means traps that function like interesting 
obstacles: big, obvious, and cool-looking.</p>
<p align="left">An example might suffice: I’ve got a room full of 
swinging, bladed pendulums—an execution chamber that’s damaged and not 
exactly functioning the way its makers intended. Is it a trap encounter?
 Yes, the PCs will still get to use Disable Device to get the bladed 
pendulums to stop swinging. The PC can still use Search to find the 
hidden button that turns off the pendulums. And PCs can pile debris in 
the path of the pendulums or figure out the pattern of their swinging 
and deftly dart across the room.</p>
<p align="left">No matter how the PCs get past the blades, the players 
feel like they did something. One way or another, they figured out a way
 to get through the room. If those blades had suddenly dropped out of 
the ceiling and started slicing up PCs, the players wouldn’t feel like 
they did something. They would feel like something was done to them. So 
I’m promising anyone who plays this adventure: No reactive traps. Listen
 at the door, sure, but you don’t need to check every single one for a <i>slay living</i> spell.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Drowses! We hates them, we does!</b></p><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Small%20-%20Adventure%20Design,%20Part%201_files/designdev_drow.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">Now I’m going to vent. In a previous column, we asked, “Which monster doesn’t deserve its place in the <b>D&amp;D</b> monster hall of fame?” The most common response was: the drow.</p>
<p align="left">I think drow have a terrific spot in the <b>D&amp;D</b> 
milieu. Conceptually, I love ‘em. But for those of you that made 
complaints about the specific nuts-and-bolts of drow mechanics, I’m here
 to tell you: I feel your pain.</p>
<p align="left">I’m using them as antagonists in part of the adventure, 
and it’s outrageously difficult to get them to earn their Challenge 
Rating. Why? Three reasons:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Reason I hate the drow #1:</b> I’m giving up 1 point 
of CR off the bat, just because they’re drow. Yeah, I know I get spell 
resistance and some spell-like abilities, but in a low-level game, a 
point of CR is huge.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Reason I hate the drow #2:</b> They’re basic humanoids, so I have to build them with class levels. The rule that says “an <i>n</i>th-level NPC is a CR <i>n</i>
 monster”… well, let’s just say that the rule isn’t beyond reproach. 
It’s true of some classes within some level ranges, but it’s simply not 
accurate as a general rule. I don’t think any designer will tell you 
with a straight face that a 1st-level NPC wizard is a good challenge for
 four 1st-level PCs. (Better hope the NPC gets that <i>sleep</i> spell 
off, huh?) So my low-level drow have 1 point of CR vanish into thin air,
 and they lose more oomph because they’re built with class levels.</p>

right at any monster’s bottom line: their hit points. For a monster, hit
 points effectively determine how long that monster gets to stay 
onstage. At the point where I’m designing CR 3 drow with only 14 hit 
points, I’m asking myself, “Are these guys going to survive into the 
second round?” When I’m designing monsters with a game-time lifespan of 
12 seconds, I start questioning whether they’re worth the ink.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Extra bonus reason to hate the drow:</b> It’s true 
that drow have survivability beyond those 14 hit points. They’ve got 
spell resistance and probably concealment by virtue of their <i>darkness</i>
 spell-like ability. But both of those defenses can play at the table in
 dissatisfying ways. Both spell resistance and the miss chance from 
concealment are “neener neener” abilities. They turn successes that the 
player takes for granted into failures. They feel capricious. The wizard
 “knows” the <i>magic missile</i> is going to work, but then… neener 
neener, it doesn’t. The fighter rolls a 20, grabs the lucky “crit” dice,
 but then… neener neener, the miss chance kicks in. The neener neener 
defenses are fine in moderation. But if you populate a whole dungeon 
with them, you’re asking for frustrated players.</p>
<p align="left">Next time, I’ll go through the rest of my notes, 
including why I’ve got mad love for the gnolls, how to find the right 
level of “map linearity,” and which encounters tested particularly well.</p>
<p align="left">We’ll also talk a little more about traps. If you’ve experienced a particularly good obstacle-style trap, zap an email to <a href="mailto:%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20dndcolumn@wizards.com">dndcolumn@wizards.com</a>
 and tell us about it. You already know how I feel about reactive 
booby-traps, so keep those to yourself. But tell me about cool traps 
that demand something of the players.</p><br><p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-10%20-%20Let%E2%80%99s%20Get%20Small%20-%20Adventure%20Design,%20Part%201_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
