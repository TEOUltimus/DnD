 hoping this column becomes your window into roleplaying design and

Wizards of the Coast. We'll handle a wide range of topics in weeks to 
come, from frank discussions about over- or underpowered material, to 
the design goals of a certain supplement, to what we think are the next 
big ideas for the<b> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> game. All of this comes bundled with a healthy look at the people and events that are roleplaying R&amp;D.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Dev Test Answers</b></p>
<p align="left">In our first article, we introduced the <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20050902a">developer test questions</a> given to R&amp;D applicants. By now you've had a chance to formulate your own responses, given in the following <a target="_blank" href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=7143182">message board thread</a>.
 This week, we present the answers as given by recently hired Mike 
Mearls -- and with comments provided by Development's Jesse Decker.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker (Development):</b> The development test measures analytical ability, mastery of the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 rules, and writing skill. Analytical ability easily ranks as the most 
important quality in a developer. Since the development team is 
responsible for measuring and verifying game balance, precise insight 
into game balance is a must. There’s certainly room for a developer’s 
rote knowledge of the rules to improve on the job (in fact, it’s 
required), but that’s only a small part of the test. Likewise, while 
developers needn’t be wordsmiths capable of world-class poetry, we 
expect developers to improve a manuscript whenever they touch it, and a 
paragraph of prose shouldn’t get worse because of a developer’s 
involvement. For this reason, we warn those taking the test that the 
quality of writing plays some part in the scoring.</p>
<p align="left"><b>1. In D&amp;D, class and race are crucial elements 
that define a character's role in the party and his place in the world. 
It's no coincidence that they're among the most important game mechanics
 for developers to understand.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>a) What is the most powerful <b> class</b> in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> and why is it the most powerful?</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2010-07%20-%20Dev%20Test%20Answers_files/dndcolumn_cleric.jpg" align="right" border="0"><b>Mike Mearls:</b>
 The cleric is the most powerful class. Aside from its mechanical 
advantages – its access to divine spells, ability to wear heavy armor, 
average base attack, turning/rebuking undead, and two good saves – the 
cleric's role within the party is perhaps the most vital to the players'
 success. The cleric is responsible for keeping the other players active
 with its ability to heal. While magic items can cover this gap, most 
items that a party can afford don't provide enough healing on a 
round-to-round basis. The person playing the cleric can exert a lot of 
control over the party's decisions. For example, during a battle, the 
cleric moves away from the monsters and announces that if anyone wants 
healing, they have to move back to his position. The players must follow
 the cleric if they want their characters to survive.</p>
<p align="left">While the cleric is the strongest class, I would argue 
that it is not unbalanced. Its abilities are fundamentally passive – 
they remove conditions rather than inflict them. The cleric needs to be 
powerful in order to attract players to the role. I think the cleric 
illustrates that mechanics must sometimes be judged according to 
criteria other than pure mathematical analysis.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="
        global_reveal_layer('answer1')
      ">Development's Response</a></p>
<div style="position: relative; visibility: hidden;" id="answer1">
<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> Correct answers to this question 
depend much more on analyzing the chosen class rather than producing a 
correct answer. For this question, there’s reasonable justification for 
most of the spellcasting classes, depending on the accuracy and 
completeness of the analysis. Mike identifies some, but not all, of the 
reasons that the cleric is powerful. A perfect answer for the cleric 
would need to address the cleric’s abilities through feats and buff 
spell selection to meet or surpass the melee ability of just about any 
class, while preserving the spellcaster’s hallmark versatility in the 
face of nearly every encounter.</p>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>b) What is the least powerful <b> race</b> in the <i>Player's Handbook, </i>and why is it the least powerful?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> The half-elf is the least powerful 
race, because it is an elf with the weapon proficiency, secret door 
detection abilities, and racial ability adjustments removed and the 
bonus to Spot and Listen reduced. In return, the half-elf gains a +2 
bonus to Diplomacy and Gather Information checks. These bonuses are 
useful only for a narrow range of characters – low Charisma characters 
and those who do not have Diplomacy and Gather Information as class 
skills gain little benefit from it since these skills operate against 
static DCs rather than opposed checks. In an opposed check, there's 
always a chance that you face an untrained or penalized foe, making any 
sort of bonus useful. Since both Diplomacy and Gather Information can be
 used untrained, they are poor investments unless you can use them to 
routinely beat high (20+) DCs. If anyone in the party aside from the 
half-elf invests in those skills, the half-elf's bonus is largely 
useless.</p>
<p align="left">The ability to count any class as favored is a minor 
edge, especially compared to the human benefits. In comparison, the 
elf's secret door detection is useful to any character, while Spot and 
Listen are useful in almost every encounter.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="
        global_reveal_layer('answer2')
      ">Development's Response</a></p>
<div style="position: relative; visibility: hidden;" id="answer2">
<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> Mike’s answer is correct, not 
because he chose the weakest race but because he demonstrated that the 
half-elf’s puny bonuses don’t compare at all with the other races. One 
of the not-so-obvious purposes of this question is to see how the 
potential developer deals with the word “weakest.” There can be all 
kinds of weaknesses in a roleplaying product, but the developer's job is
 to focus on the power level of game elements -- which means that 
interpreting this question as an analysis of a race’s combat ability is 
important.</p>
</div>
<p align="left">Other popular answers to this question include the gnome
 and half-orc. While both of those races have their limitations (gnomes 
are mostly overshadowed by halflings, and half-orcs are severly limited 
in their choice of classes), both can shine in specialized builds.</p>

<p align="left"><b>2. <i>Longstrider</i> is a 1st-level ranger and druid
 spell that increases movement by 10 feet for 1 hour per level. Is this 
spell more powerful, equally powerful, or less powerful than most 
1st-level spells? Why do you think this is true?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> I believe that <i>longstrider</i> is powerful for a 1st level spell, but not overly so when compared to <i>magic missile</i> or <i>shield of faith</i>. It falls above the average 1st-level spell in that it remains useful at high levels.</p>
<p align="left">The key to its utility lies in its 1 hour per level 
duration. A high level druid, ranger, or cleric with the Travel domain 
gains the equivalent of a +10 feet bonus to movement in return for a 1st
 level spell slot each day. Longstrider has several factors that prevent
 it from becoming overly powerful. As a personal spell, it can only 
affect the caster. Thus, the caster must be built to take advantage of 
the spell. Considering that the barbarian has a 1st-level ability that 
grants the same benefit without any duration, the spell also seems about
 right in terms of power.</p>
<p align="left">If this spell's range was changed to touch, I believe it
 would become too powerful. In that case, the entire party could 
essentially operate with a +10 bonus to speed at high levels, plus 
characters such as rogues, monks and barbarians, who generally gain the 
most from a speed increase, could consistently gain access to its 
benefits.</p>
<p><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="
        global_reveal_layer('answer3')
      ">Development's Response</a></p>
<div style="position: relative; visibility: hidden;" id="answer3">
<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> In this case, there’s a right answer. <i>Longstrider</i>
 is a very powerful spell, solely because of its duration. Understanding
 the value of an in-combat action plays a large part in balancing one 
game element against another, and this question is meant to measure that
 understanding. As the characters gain levels, higher-level spells fill 
up most of a character’s in-combat actions during each day; so, a 
1st-level spell with an effect that has a meaningful impact on a combat 
situation, but with a duration long enough to last through all of the 
day’s combats, is very valuable. Despite these strengths, there are 
other 1st-level spells that rival <i>longstrider</i>, especially at low 
levels, so while the spell pushes the power curve, it’s probably not 
broken. Were it a 2nd-level spell it would still be good, but it would 
fall in the mid-range of spell power rather than near the top.</p>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>3. The concept of the "swift action" (as described in such books as <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> and <i>Complete Arcane</i>)
 is a relatively new addition to D&amp;D. Why were swift actions 
(especially swift-action casting time spells) added to the game? What's 
the downside of adding swift actions to the game?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> The swift action was added to the 
game to make spellcasting warriors a viable option. A multiclassed 
fighter/wizard, or a class such as the psychic warrior, is forced to 
make a single, critical decision – cast a spell now and attack next 
turn, or attack now and forget about using a spell. This problem becomes
 even worse at high levels. Spellcasting warrior characters must either 
have time to buff before a battle, or they lose the benefits offered by 
their spells. This case also extends to any spellcaster/non-spellcaster 
multiclass combination.</p>
<p align="left">The downside to swift actions is that they can extend 
the time it takes for player to resolve his action. Not only must he 
decide either which spell to cast or who to attack, but he must now 
decide which spell to use and which opponent to strike. In addition, a 
swift action spell gains the equivalent of the Quicken Spell metamagic 
feat. Granting a character the ability to cast two spells on his action 
opens up some potentially troublesome combinations. For example, any 
swift action damaging spell that requires an attack roll will almost 
invariably end up comboed with <i>true strike</i>.</p>

        global_reveal_layer('answer4')
      ">Development's Response</a></p>
<div style="position: relative; visibility: hidden;" id="answer4">
<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> In R&amp;D parlance, swift actions 
open up a lot of “design space,” allowing effects that might not 
otherwise be interesting to players to find a place in the game. They 
relate directly to the understanding and measuring of the value of an 
in-combat action versus the power of a specific game element.</p>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>4. You're part of the development team for the next 
D&amp;D sourcebook. If these two feats were part of the design turnover,
 what are some comments that you would make about them?</b></p>

<p align="left"><b><i>Arcane Defiance</i></b><br>Your knowledge of one school of spells enables you to better resist spells from that school.<br><b>Prerequisites: </b>Int 12, Spell Focus in the chosen school, ability to cast one spell from the selected school.<br><b>Benefit:</b>
 Select one school of spells that you can cast and for which you have 
the Spell Focus feat. You get a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells
 from that school.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> Arcane Defiance seems a bit weak for
 a feat. Compared to Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes and Great Fortitude, 
it offers half the bonus against a potentially more limited range of 
spells. While it does apply to all three saves, the limited range of 
effects it protects against make it a bit weak. This feat is drastically
 more useful against the evocation, enchantment, and necromancy schools 
compared to conjuration or divination. A +2 bonus fits better with the 
established save improving feats. The prerequisites feel a little vague –
 does a wizard qualify if he has a spell in his spellbooks? Does a 
cleric qualify if the appropriate spell is on his spell list? I would 
suggest removing it, as the Spell Focus prerequisite seems to provide 
enough of a link to the chosen school at a much higher cost to a wizard,
 cleric, or druid. In comparison, a sorcerer or bard pays a steeper 
price for this feat.</p>
<p align="left">The name is inaccurate. There's nothing here that 
prevents a divine caster from taking this feat. The Intelligence 
prerequisite does not seem justified in this light. If this feat is 
supposed to reflect an arcane specialist's ability to resist his chosen 
school, the prerequisites should illustrate that.</p>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> This feat fails to cover all the facets that are in play here. What is the caster level for the <i>wall of fire</i>?
 How does one determine the save DC? Is this used as a supernatural or 
spell-like ability? What are the exact mechanics of "use your breath 
weapon"? Does this require the creature to exhaust its use of the breath
 weapon? Are there limits to how often you can use this feat? There 
should be, because a creature that can breathe once per round can choke 
up the entire battlefield with walls.</p>
<p align="left">Since this feat generates a <i>wall of fire</i>, the 
prereqs should include language to allow only creatures with a 
fire-based breath weapon to use it, or it should explain how a creature 
creates a fire effect from a non-fire breath weapon. More importantly, <i>wall of fire</i>
 is a 4th level spell. A prerequisite must ensure that only PCs or 
creatures of an appropriate CR or level have access to this feat, 
especially since the number of times per day the character can use the 
feat is tied to his breath weapon, not this feat. The Charisma 
requirement places no value on a PC's power.</p>

regeneration (all damage taken is subdual damage + constructs are immune
 to subdual damage = ridiculously hard to kill). Since Rob was the lead 
designer of the <b>D&amp;D</b> Minis game, it seemed fitting to cite a

<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> The sonic weakness seems 
problematic, since it forces the player to keep separate track of sonic 
and normal damage. The magic immunity ability does not work like the 
other golems' ability from previous sets. The golem is awfully slow and 
high AC for a CG figure – the basic stats feel more LG. In addition, its
 pitiable attack bonus makes the golem useful against a narrow slice of 
opponents, primarily low AC CE figures; unless there's a good synergy 
with another figure in the current set, I think the golem costs too much
 or needs an improved attack bonus. As its stands, this figure is good 
at occupying a space and absorbing attacks, but with its slow speed it 
is easy to outmaneuver, and its poor attack bonus makes drawing an AoO 
from it a low risk gamble.</p>
<p align="left">It would be clearer in play to make the figure "neutral"
 a la Mordenkainen and include a warband building ability that grants it
 fearless in CG. The 5-point increase in cost seems like something that 
would be easy to overlook in play. I think it would be clearer to simply
 make the figure available to all factions and cost it appropriately.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> There are so many problems with the
 miniature that it’s impossible to get them all in one pass. So many 
problems exist that you don’t need specific DDM knowledge to find enough
 to get this question (which was not weighted very heavily in the 
scores) correct.</p>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>6. Your development team has decided that this rule 
is mechanically balanced, but the team lead tells you that it needs to 
be rewritten for clarity. How might you rewrite this rule and why?</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>While this effect affects you, your Reflexive saves 
are improved by +2 if you're a rogue or other kind of character with 
evasion, except when she's flat-footed or loses her AC Dex bonus, in 
which case she doesn't get any bonus, but if she has improved evasion 
improves you to +4.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> There is no such thing as a 
Reflexive save – I assumed the designer meant Reflex save. The prereqs 
for the bonuses are poorly worded – it could be read to mean that all 
rogues along with all characters who have evasion gain the benefits. I 
assume that isn't the case, since prereqs don't normally require a 
specific class. The bonuses are unlabeled. Since they go away when a PC 
loses his Dex bonus to AC, it is best to label them as dodge bonuses, 
particularly since dodge bonuses stack and, as an unnamed bonus, this 
ability also stacks. It has the same effect in fewer words and it keeps 
things tidy with respect to abilities that interact with dodge bonuses. I
 also assume that a flat-footed character loses the bonus even if he has
 improved evasion. The text above is unclear on that point.</p>
<p align="left">I would re-write the material to:<br><i>This effect 
grants a +2 dodge bonus to Reflex saves if you have evasion, or a +4 
dodge bonus to Reflex saves if you have improved evasion.</i></p>

<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> Ultimately, this question was a 
bust. Nearly every one got it right, and those who got it wrong 
demonstrated consistent weakness in their writing while answering other 
questions.</p>
</div>
<p align="left"><b>7. Describe a game mechanic (from a game other than a
 roleplaying game) that you think is good, and explain why you think 
it's good.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Mike Mearls:</b> I love mechanics that emphasize the fun parts of a game while pushing the dull parts to the background. <i>Halo 2</i>'s
 damage system removes the typical health meter found in first person 
shooters. Instead, each player has a shield that soaks damage. Once the 
shield is gone, additional shots damage a target based on where they 
hit. When the shields recharge, all body damage heals.</p>
<p align="left">The time needed to recharge is long enough that you are 
unlikely to heal in the middle of a firefight, but it readies you for 
the next area of a map once you defeat your current foes. This 
emphasizes the fun parts of <i>Halo</i> – running around, blasting away 
at enemies – without forcing players to spend time in search of healing 
or power-ups. Such a search isn't necessarily fun, and it puts the game 
on hold until the player is in a good shape to continue.</p>
<p align="left">In multiplayer games, this mechanic encourages good 
tactics. An ambush or clever use of terrain gives a big edge, since in 
most cases two opponents meet with full shields. If it takes 10 shots to
 defeat an opponent, whoever fires first, or whoever makes an opponent 
miss more often, gains a big advantage.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Jesse Decker:</b> What might look like a blow-off 
question tested several things – are you engaged in games and playing 
more than RPGs, can you separate a single mechanic from a game that you 
like, and can you talk about and analyze an individual mechanic without 
the familiar context of the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> rules? Mike’s 
answer is again a good one, taking a single mechanic from a game and 
dissecting it’s impact on the play experience. Understanding how a 
specific mechanic is going to work at the table is a big part of 
development’s job.</p>

<p align="left"><b>About the Authors</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Design: David Noonan</b> is a designer/developer for Wizards of the Coast. His credits include co-designing <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II, Heroes of Battle, </i>and numerous products for the <i>Eberron</i> campaign setting. He lives in Washington state with his wife, son, and daughter.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Development: Jesse Decker (male human, CR 1/8):</b> I first picked up a d20 somewhere in the early eighties, and I often tell the story of my intro to <b>D&amp;D</b>.
 I was in elementary school, and a friend received the now famous "red 
box" set as a gift from his parents. I was instantly hooked, and soon 
became a regular haunt of the one hobby bookshop here in Renton, WA. 
Fast forward through some-teen years of gaming (with occasional 
interruptions for things like school), and just out of college I land a 
job as editorial assistant for <i>Dragon</i> Magazine. The eight years since that entrance to the gaming industry have included a two-year stint as editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon</i>, freelance design credits such as <i>Hammer &amp; Helm</i>, and <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>.</p>
<p align="left">In the middle of 2003, I left the helm of <i>Dragon</i> for a chance to do full-time design in Wizards' R&amp;D group, and was lucky enough to work on books like <i>Complete Adventurer</i> and the <i>DMG II</i>.
 I clearly liked to talk too much to remain on the design team, so I 
moved over to manage the relatively new development team for RPGs and <b>D&amp;D</b> Minis.</p>
<p align="left">It's easily the best job in the whole world, but even 
so, I swear that as soon as I level up I'm taking the Talk Less in Class
 feat.</p>
