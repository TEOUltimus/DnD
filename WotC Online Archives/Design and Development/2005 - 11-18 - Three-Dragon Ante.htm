 hoping this column becomes your window into roleplaying design and 
development -- or at least the way we approach these things here at 
Wizards of the Coast. We'll handle a wide range of topics in weeks to 
come, from frank discussions about over- or underpowered material, to 
the design goals of a certain supplement, to what we think are the next 
big ideas for the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> game. All of this comes bundled with a healthy look at the people and events that are roleplaying R&amp;D.</p>
<p align="left">The following design notes, straight from Rob Heinsoo, concentrate on how he created <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ante/welcome"><i>Three-Dragon Ante</i></a> as a game you can play with both your <b>D&amp;D</b>
 group or your non-gaming friends. In a couple of weeks, he’ll return 
with another article touching on games within fantasy worlds -- specific
 on <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> as it appears inside the world of <b>D&amp;D</b>.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Today’s article is broken into three sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Section 1</b> covers how I came up with <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i>, and how it took shape during playtesting at Wizards of the Coast.</li>
<li><b>Section 2</b> explains why <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> deliberately plays differently than the king of gambling card games, poker.</li>
<li><b>Section 3</b> details some game design lessons I learned (or 
relearned) while hammering the game into its publishable form. It’s 
something like an outtakes reel, a series of bad ideas that got better 
in the final cut.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>1. Origin Story: A One Year Turnaround</b></p><img src="2005%20-%2011-18%20-%20Three-Dragon%20Ante_files/dndcolumn_3da.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left"><b>The Concept</b><br><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ante/welcome"><i>Three-Dragon Ante</i></a>
 started miles and miles away from most Wizards of the Coast games -- I 
was snorkeling above a coral reef while on vacation in Hawaii. My 
thoughts drifted out of vacation, back to playing <b>D&amp;D</b> on the 
mainland; I realized that I wanted the PCs in my Wednesday night 
campaign to play a card game in a tavern they were about to visit, on a 
mission of mercy for a dying friend.</p>
<p align="left">So I wondered what card game they’d play in the tavern. 
Not poker. Playing poker didn’t make any sense to me. My background is 
in cultural anthropology, and I couldn’t stomach the sloppiness of 
pretending that <b>D&amp;D</b>’s fantasy world could (or would want to) 
recreate the specifics of our own culture’s 52-card deck, or even its 
disguised cousin, the tarot deck.</p>
<p align="left">I circled around a chunk of green coral and thought about how I might focus a gambling game played in the world of <b>D&amp;D</b>.
 Something involving dragons seemed right. That way I could use the ten 
main colors of dragon as the suits, with each type of dragon having its 
own unique power. There’d be big piles of gold on the table, and each 
player would play dragon cards to try and win the stakes.</p>
<p align="left">By the time I swam back to the beach, I’d worked out the
 game’s basic mechanics, in which high cards help you win the stakes at 
the end of each hand, and low cards win micro-rewards by being more 
likely to trigger their powers.</p>
<p align="left">I thought about the game for the rest of the vacation, 
tinkering with possible card powers and card-drawing mechanics while 
hiking or snorkeling. I had the first deck ready by the time I got back 
to the mainland (this was mid-January 2005). I knew it didn’t quite 
work, but I eventually got a game together with three other Wizards 
designers. Two or three big rules changed in the middle of the first 
game (see section 3 below!), but the concept looked like it was going to
 fly.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The First Playtests</b><br> A draft or two and a 
couple weeks later I played a game with Andrew Finch, Wizards of the 
Coast’s Director of New Business. By coincidence, Loren Greenwood, 
WotC’s CEO, came into Andrew’s office just as I’d started demonstrating 
the game, and stuck around to play a couple hands. He won the hands 
resoundingly, playing an all-Gold Dragon flight and collecting gold from
 every player as well as picking up the stakes. Loren left the office 
saying that he really liked the game; and no, we hadn’t tried to hand 
our boss the win. He genuinely kicked our butts.</p>
<p align="left">In the next couple weeks, I played the game with my bosses in roleplaying R&amp;D and the <b>D&amp;D</b> Brand folks. The consensus was that making a card game played by <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> adventurers was a good idea and that the flavor and mechanics of <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i>
 handled the job. So with remarkably few complications, the game went 
onto the publishing schedule, aiming to be out by the end of 2005 -- 
which made it an extremely quick turnaround.</p><img src="2005%20-%2011-18%20-%20Three-Dragon%20Ante_files/dndcolumn_3da1.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left"><b>The Look and Feel</b><br>From the start, I’d said that I wanted the game to look like a deck that might be used in the <b>D&amp;D</b> world. That meant we weren’t going to use the modern-illustration style from our <i>Monster Manual</i>s and <b>D&amp;D</b>
 book covers. We had to find an artist with a style that could look 
something like woodcuts done in a fantasy rather than a 
straight-medieval world.</p>
<p align="left">The sample piece that sold the art directors on using 
Craig Phillips as the artist later transformed into the game’s beautiful
 card back. I’m aware that some fans are surprised by the art style, 
expecting something more like standard <b>D&amp;D</b> illustrations; 
nevertheless, I’m extremely happy with the cleaner style Craig used. If 
the game does well, there might even be room for another style on a deck
 produced by a different socio-magico strata in the <b>D&amp;D</b> world… because there are certainly multiple <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> deck designs in each <b>D&amp;D</b> world, just as there have always been multiple playing card designs in our world.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>2. UnPoker: Because Poker’s Been Done</b></p>
<p align="left">As a gambling game, <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> lives in poker’s world. Poker is a splendid game, and I haven’t been certain that it needs more variants. So my goal with <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i>
 was to create a different gambling-game experience. I wanted to create 
UnPoker, a game that would share poker’s mercenary attitude but avoid 
the things I like least about it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>No Folding</b><br> In part, poker is about knowing 
when to fold. If you’re playing right, you’re dodging out of many 
unfavorable hands. However, I wanted <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> to keep 
everyone at the table involved at all times – no folding in the middle 
of hands. In my first thoughts about the game, I decided that low cards 
would be useful in that they would have powers that could earn you 
little micro-rewards, reasons to feel at least a little good about 
needing to stay in. So when you’re not playing to win a gambit, you can 
still play to steal gold from the stakes (using Black and White 
Dragons), demand gold or cards from other players (Green and Brass 
Dragons), or draw new cards to set yourself up for the next gambit 
(Silver and Gold Dragons). Of course, if somebody plays the Druid and 
its power triggers, you might just end up in the running for the weakest
 flight and still sneak away with all the gold at the end of the gambit.</p><img src="2005%20-%2011-18%20-%20Three-Dragon%20Ante_files/dndcolumn_3da2.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">Plus,
 if you’re lucky enough to have three dragons of the same color or the 
same strength, you might be able to collect more gold (or at least more 
cards) than the eventual winner of the gambit. Even starting with two 
dragons of the same color gives you a shot at finding a third, 
especially if they’re good dragons or you know how to finesse your way 
into running out of cards so that you have to buy more before the end of
 the gambit.…</p>
<p align="left"><b>Table Stakes, Not Unlimited Stakes</b><br> Poker has 
another feature I wanted to avoid: infinitely escalating stakes and 
bullying. Poker is a full-force psychological brawl, and players with 
more money can often beat lesser players into submission with their 
bankrolls. I don’t have a problem with that from a game design sense, my
 issue is personal. I wanted to design a game anyone could play with 
their family! This meant that I needed to keep the game simple, 
preferably about as simple as Hearts. And I also needed to keep it from 
being <i>all</i> about psychological warfare, because <i>my</i> family won’t play poker with me.</p>
<p align="left">This isn’t to say that <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> is a 
game for people dedicated to being nice to each other; try playing three
 Green Dragons in one hand and see what the player to your left thinks 
of you. The big moments in a given gambit usually involve screwing at 
least one other player. But by saying that every <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i>
 game starts with each player supplying 50 gold pieces they’re willing 
to lose, the potential losses for a given game are limited to roughly 50
 gold apiece. When the player who’s in the lead antes big to try to 
force out the weakest player and win the game, the weakest player is 
fighting to keep on playing and win some gold back, rather than fighting
 to hold onto all their worldly possessions.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>3. The Nitty Gritty: Specific Design Issues</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Zeroth Draft</b><br><i>Game Design Issue:</i> Simultaneous card play.</p>
<p align="left">The very first draft of <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> asked 
all players to lay their cards down simultaneously. I’m trying to 
reconstruct my reasons for thinking why that could have been a good 
idea. I must have thought it would be quicker, which wasn’t necessarily 
going to be true given that power-triggering still depended on looking 
at the card played by the neighbor to your right.</p>
<p align="left">Maybe I thought it would be more dramatic to have all cards played simultaneously. Certainly I was staking out ways in which <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i>
 could be different than other card games, and I liked the visual drama 
of players placing their card in front of their forehead and then 
slamming them down on the table.</p>
<p align="left">But simultaneous play increases a game’s randomness 
while removing most elements of strategy. As we started our second 
hand/gambit, Henry Stern and Mike Donais wanted to know what 
simultaneous play added to the game. I had no good answer, so we started
 taking turns playing cards, clockwise around the table….</p>
<p align="left"><b>Killing the High-Low Flip Flop, Tinkering the Ante</b><br><i>Game Design Issue:</i> Randomness reduces strategy.</p>
<p align="left">Before writing this article, I’d forgotten that there 
was another dead-end complication that failed to survive the first five 
minutes of actual game-play. I’d come to the table thinking that we’d 
flip a coin at the start of each hand. If the coin came up heads, we’d 
be playing a Fangs hand, and <i>higher</i> cards would be the cards that triggered their power during their turn. Tails? The lower cards’ powers would trigger.</p>
<p align="left">How embarrassing. As soon as playtest cards hit the 
table, the Fangs/Tails conceit revealed itself as an ugly monkey-glitch 
tossed into the game’s potentially elegant high-low triggering system. 
By the third hand, we stuck to the idea that high cards were good 
because you could win the stakes and low cards were good because they 
were more likely to trigger.</p>
<p align="left">That original zeroth draft version of the game had also 
turned over a random card to see how much gold each gambit was being 
played for. Yes, completely random stakes, another overly-random 
simplification I’d included to make the game play quickly. It turned out
 that the game wanted a bit more strategy and less luck. By the time we 
were finishing the first playtest, I’d realized that players should be 
anteing cards out of their hand to determine the stakes. Now players 
have to judge their chances of winning a gambit to determine which card 
they want to ante, and if you pay attention to the card an opponent 
antes, you’ll have a better understanding of the cards that might be in 
their hand.</p>
<p align="left">Getting rid of the coin flip cleared the way for the 
ante-card as the means of determining the stakes, which in turn opened 
up good powers for cards like the Bronze Dragon and the Archmage. The 
game never looked so bad again, and I nearly forgot it had ever been 
that dumb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bad Point Spread</b><br><i>Game Design Issue:</i> Wide differences in card power create hopeless situations.</p>
<p align="left">From the start, I’d rated the dragons’ strength ratings to simulate the power of <b>D&amp;D</b>’s
 different types of dragons. The strongest White Dragon was only a match
 for a middling Blue or Red Dragon, the Red Dragon had the highest 
average strength among the evil dragons, and the Silver and Gold Dragons
 ruled the good dragons’ ratings. But my initial numbers were too widely
 scattered, ranging from 1 to 23, making the difference between high 
cards and low cards too extreme. Mike Donais, Rob Watkins and Mike 
Turian advised narrowing the scale, and when I started messing around 
with that I found the 13-point scale from our earthly 52-card decks 
staring me in the face.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> decks still don’t try to make 
all the suits equal: some dragons are more equal than others. But the 
13-point scale gave me a nice impressive number for the biggest dragons 
(Bahamut, Tiamat, and the biggest Gold) and worked well with the ante 
mechanism, while still giving me enough range to differentiate between 
the dragon types. The second try at the point-spread survived through 
publication.</p><img src="2005%20-%2011-18%20-%20Three-Dragon%20Ante_files/dndcolumn_3da4.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left"><b>Good &amp; Evil</b><br><i>Design Issue:</i> Capturing the flavor of good and evil dragons with game mechanics.</p>
<p align="left">The original design said that good dragons had powers 
that let you draw cards and that most evil dragons had powers that let 
you steal cards from other players. The idea was that the good dragons 
could create something new. The evil dragons just ‘redistributed’ 
resources, forcing you to buy new cards eventually if you only played 
evil dragons. Cute. But it turned out that this meant too much stealing.
 No one could form a coherent strategy when they were always losing 
cards they had intended to play later. The problem got highlighted when 
my boss’ boss, Bill Slavicsek, spent his entire first game buying new 
cards to replace the last cards that had been stolen before he had a 
chance to play.</p>
<p align="left">I tackle design problems like this in my 
background-brain, thinking about them while driving or hiking. It took 
about two weeks to put together a new set of powers, keeping the idea 
that good dragons can set you up for winning future hands and that evil 
dragons mainly give you the instant gratification of grabbing things 
that don’t belong to you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Correcting the Downward Spiral</b><br><i>Design Issue:</i> Recognizing an opportunity for better gameplay.</p>
<p align="left">The game worked well with its third draft. But there was
 still one problem: I was still playing that in order to trigger, a card
 had to be less than or equal to <i>all</i> cards played in the round. 
That was a death spiral effect, and not much fun. When Richard Garfield 
and Bill Rose played the game one weekday, they both had the same 
comment: “Play so that your card triggers if it’s not stronger than the <i>last</i>
 card played in the round.” This single change got rid of the death 
spiral, and meant that a person playing a tiny card was only going to 
screw the player to their left, not everybody. This change made all the 
difference. <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> games became fully fun, and there wasn’t another big change made to the mechanics.</p>
<p align="left">That’s it for now. See you in a couple weeks with more notes on <i>Three-Dragon Ante</i> place inside <b>D&amp;D</b>.</p>
