 hoping this column becomes your window into roleplaying design and 
development -- or at least the way we approach these things here at 
Wizards of the Coast. We'll handle a wide range of topics in weeks to 
come, from frank discussions about over- or underpowered material, to 
the design goals of a certain supplement, to what we think are the next 
big ideas for the<b> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> game. All of this comes bundled with a healthy look at the people and events that are roleplaying R&amp;D.</p>
<p align="left">This week, we look at the design side of things.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><i>What makes a memorable monster? The hard truth is that we don't really know.</i></p>
<p align="left">When the designers are sitting around brainstorming 
ideas for monsters, we often talk about "traction." Traction is our 
shorthand for the idea that you'll design a monster... and then someone 
will feature that monster prominently in an adventure... someone else 
comes up with a template version of the monster, a halfbreed version, a 
version suitable as a PC race... DMs all over the world start using the 
monster in their ongoing games -- and voila! The monster has traction. 
It has a grip on the <b>D&amp;D</b> collective and it won't slip into obscurity.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-09%20-%20Monsters%20with%20Traction_files/dx20050909a_fiendfolio_sm.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="222" width="177">That's the idea. But then, we don't really know why some monsters get traction and others don't.</p>
<p align="left">It's easy to see traction in hindsight. The poster child for the traction concept is the githyanki. It's one of <b>D&amp;D</b>'s
 coolest monsters, but there are lots of monsters designed in that 
"magic-using powerful humanoid" niche that the githyanki occupies. 
Somehow the githyanki has survived, thriving in dozens of products and 
eventually earning a place in the current <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">Monster Manual</a></i>.</p>
<p align="left">Why did the githyanki gain traction? Some possible reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li> It had an interesting history and a connection to an existing <b>D&amp;D</b> monster, the mind flayer.<br><br></li>
<li> It eventually developed a connection to a subset of the rules, psionics, that some <b>D&amp;D</b> fans just love.<br><br></li>
<li> It's depicted in full color on the cover of the original <i>Fiend Folio</i>--in an era where most monster illustration were black and white line drawings in little boxes about the size of a <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> card.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In the case of the githyanki, it might have achieved traction simply because it made the <i>Fiend Folio </i>cover (plus the fact that it's awesome). A little historical perspective: The 1981 <i>Fiend Folio</i> was, for most <b>D&amp;D</b> players at the time, a huge event. It was the first time we had a major influx of new monsters beyond the <i>Monster Manual, </i>so DMs went crazy putting <i>Fiend Folio </i>monsters everywhere they could. It's not surprising that many of them gravitated toward the monster on the cover.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-09%20-%20Monsters%20with%20Traction_files/dx20050909a_mmii_sm.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="222" width="177">The "put 'em on the cover" trick doesn't guarantee traction every time. Look at the 1983 <i>Monster Manual II. </i>When
 was the last time you used a firbog in your game? (Or then again, is 
that the world's most charismatic fomorian giant? On that note, the <b>D&amp;D</b> art process is a whole 'nother topic!)</p>
<p align="left">The ability to gain traction seems unrelated to either 
the monster's basic concept or its specific design elements. The owlbear
 clearly has traction, for instance, but we'd be hard pressed to figure 
out why. Conceptually it's a pretty basic stitching together of two 
real-world animals, and that's a trick <b>D&amp;D</b> designers have tried hundreds of times over the past thirty years. But why did the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/MM35_gallery/MM35_PG206.jpg">owlbear</a> gain traction when the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/images/mof_gallery/MonFaePG69.jpg">peryton</a> (owl/elk) didn't? We don't have the answer.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Traction Today</b></p>
<p align="left">If anything, it's harder for a monster to gain traction 
today than it was for the githyanki back in 1981. For starters, it's a 
much more crowded field. We <b>D&amp;D</b> designers introduce 200 to 
300 monsters to the environment every year -- almost a monster a day. 
With templates, classes and Hit Die advancement, a DM can customize 
existing monsters to get a "new monster" feel on an "old monster" 
chassis. Taken collectively, third-party publishers crank out monsters 
even faster than Wizards does.</p>
<p align="left">So if I design the greatest monster ever, it's competing for traction with monsters from:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Monster Manuals <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">I</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/882680000">II</a>, </i>and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/179210000">III</a></i><i>, </i>and the 2003 <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/886610000">Fiend Folio</a></i>.</li>
<li> Dozens of <b>D&amp;D</b> sourcebooks.</li>
<li> Dozens of third-party d20 system books.</li>
<li> The DM's imagination -- and those DMs are now armed with solid 
monster-creation rules and dozens of customization options (templates, 
classes, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td><b><i>Tangent Alert!: </i></b>There's
 a pretty obvious business reason why we don't have a product line 
that's mostly adventures anymore -- you're selling them to only one of 
the five people at the gaming table, the DM. And let's be clear: we like
 making money. But it's not just a business decision. It's bad for the 
health of the hobby if the DM gets a bunch of new toys to play with, but
 the players rarely do. So we can't give a monster traction just by 
putting it into an adventure we know everyone is going to be playing for
 the next three months.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">That's a daunting field to compete against.</p>
<p align="left">There's another advantage that quality monsters from the 1980s had: A <b>D&amp;D</b> product line short on sourcebooks but long on adventures. The drow don't appear in the original <i>Monster Manual</i>; instead, a series of 32-page adventures exposed <b>D&amp;D</b> players to everyone's favorite dark elves. Because those adventures essentially defined the shared play experience that <b>D&amp;D</b> fans had, the drow gained instant traction.</p>
<p align="left">That trick's a lot harder to pull off nowadays. Instead 
of one sourcebook a year and lots of adventures, we have lots of 
sourcebooks each year and only a handful of adventures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>So Is Traction Even Possible?</b></p>
<p align="left">I can't believe every great monster concept has already 
been done, and I can't believe that there's no room in the environment 
for the next drow or the next githyanki. As designers, we just accept 
that traction is really, really difficult to achieve. You can hope for 
traction, but you can settle for filling a niche well or creating a 
centerpiece for a solid encounter. An obscure monster has a virtue, too 
-- the virtue of surprise. Every DM loves to hear players say, "What the
 heck is that?" Dark-skinned elves with knockout poison and spell 
resistance are a surprise to precisely zero players. </p>
<p align="left">Assume for a moment that I've just created the greatest <b>D&amp;D</b> monster ever. I can't guarantee traction, but how can I improve my monster's chances?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Put 'em on the cover. </b>It worked for the githyanki, after all.
 Everyone will at least see the monster, and if they're intrigued enough
 by the art to buy the book then they're probably intrigued enough to 
take the monster out for a spin.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Get the monster into a D&amp;D Miniatures set. </b>In a lot of 
ways, this is the 21st century version of "write them into an 
adventure." A lot more people are fighting gauths nowadays simply 
because there's a miniature available for them. You are literally 
putting that monster in the hands of <b>D&amp;D</b> players all over the world.</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td><b>A True-type R&amp;D Confession: </b>Never once did an owlbear appear in my games before the <i>Harbinger</i> set of minis released. Only after the mini arrived did this long-time favorite find traction with me -- Jesse Decker.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li><b>Somehow connect the monster to an existing and beloved D&amp;D monster. </b>The
 DM is going to have an easier time integrating your monster if there's 
some existing context to work with. That's another trick that worked for
 the githyanki (former slaves of the mind flayers) and the drow (elves 
driven underground after a great schism). <br><br></li>
<li><b>Make it PC friendly. </b>Players appreciate a cool monster. But 
they drool over a cool monster that they could also use as their next 
PC. Again, this is a trick that worked for both the drow and the 
githyanki. And they're proof that the evil alignment of the monster 
isn't much of an impediment for neutral or good-aligned PCs. Everyone 
likes to play the rebel, after all. <br><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td><b><i>Tangent Alert!: </i></b>There's
 a natural tension built into the notion of a monster that you can fight
 at low, middle, and high levels. On the one hand, scalability adds a 
sense of continuity. But if every monster is perfectly scalable, players
 don't get the sense of dread from knowing they're facing a particularly
 tough monster. Most <b>D&amp;D</b> players shudder the first time a 
beholder comes floating down the corridor. But if they've been fighting 1
 Hit Die beholders from their very first session, the 11 HD version is 
just another monster. </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><br></li>
<li><b>Tie the monster to a specific part of the rules set or campaign setting. </b>DMs
 and players that want to use the relevant rules or setting will 
gravitate to the monster. Githyanki are obviously right at home in a 
psionics game, and everyone who goes underground in Eberron is going to 
face the <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/eb_gallery/82151.jpg">daelkyr</a> eventually. <br><br></li>
<li><b>Make it scalable. </b>If players fight the monster once and never
 see it again, then we've created a memorable encounter but probably 
haven't achieved traction. It's better if the monster can be an ongoing 
nemesis, and thus needs a way of keeping pace with rapidly advancing 
PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">We can do this in a lot of different ways. A monster can have different versions or castes, like the <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/mmiii_gallery/83022.jpg">mindshredders</a> in <i>Monster Manual III. </i>We
 can make a low-level base chassis (or even a template) for the monster,
 then pile on class levels. That's what the githyanki and the drow did. 
You can give them a life cycle that advances them, like dragons have. 
You can build a society of thematically similar monsters at different 
Challenge Ratings -- which is what demons and devils essentially are.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="left"><b>Developing Traction</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Development</i>: So that's how design thinks about 
traction, now what about the guys that mess around with their stuff once
 they're done? ('Round here, we call those guys 'development'.) A 
developer's job is to make sure that the game mechanics work well with 
all of the other tools we're using to give the monster traction; for 
monsters, this means that the critter must be balanced to its CR, its 
abilities must be clear, and the whole package must be mechanically 
interesting.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td><b><i>Tangent Alert!:</i></b>
 What does "mechanically interesting" mean? Well, we could fill volumes 
on that one (and we will -- soon!), but for monsters, it mostly means 
that the monster's abilities affect the encounter visibly -- that is, 
that the monster's abilities lead the characters to interesting choices 
within the encounter. These things don't have to be complex or intricate
 either. Something as simple as a very high AC for a monster's CR could 
be mechanically interesting because it encourages players to flank and 
use the aid another option if they want to melee it, or to have the 
melee combatants fight defensively and take the monster down with spells
 that do not require the caster to make an attack roll.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Development's first job, in other words, is to make sure
 that the mechanics don't get in the way of a monster's ability to 
achieve traction with you. This means that the monster must be pretty 
easy to run and still feel like it's a new kind of threat. But that's 
just the first step. The hard part is where development gets tested -- 
where the science of development gives way to the art (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20050902a">see last week's article</a>).
 The developer has to evaluate which of those tools that Dave outlined 
above are working for this monster, which aren't, and whether or not any
 need to change. On any given monster, we might face questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li> Do this monster's mechanics hold up over a wide range of levels (allowing us to include multiple versions of the monsters)?<br><br></li>
<li> Does this monster really connect to a campaign setting?<br><br></li>
<li> Are the ties this monster has to other monsters adding to all of 
the connected monsters effectively? Do the mechanics correctly echo the 
themes that these connected monsters evoke and the reasons that they are
 connected?<br><br></li>
<li> Is it really OK that this monster be in the hands of a player? (An 
awakened dolphin might have the coolest game mechanics in the world [<i>hint: </i>it doesn't], but even so, with no thumbs and bound to the sea, it's not OK as a PC.)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You get the idea: each monster presents a unique set of 
challenges and must be evaluated very carefully in relation to how it 
will perform in an encounter and how it relates to the other monsters 
that we've produced. And traction is just one of the things that we 
evaluate about each monster!</p>

<p align="left"><b>Traction in Your Own Game</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-09%20-%20Monsters%20with%20Traction_files/dx20050909a_githyanki2.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="200">When we sit around brainstorming monsters, we talk about traction in terms of the collective <b>D&amp;D</b>
 experience. But the concept of traction -- and the clues we have for 
attaining it -- is, if anything, more important at your gaming table 
than it is for the hobby as a whole. At its core, <b>D&amp;D</b> is 
about creating a memorable shared experience among friends. So the more 
characters, monsters, and places at your own game that gain traction, 
the more memorable your game will become. </p>
<p align="left">Your PCs will accumulate traction, of course. But if you
 showed up with a different PC each week, it'd be hard for any of them 
to gain traction. And some PCs are more memorable than others. Figure 
out why that is, and you've got a recipe for a better <b>D&amp;D</b> experience. </p>
<p align="left">You can try to engineer traction just like we do, 
creating villains, organizations and adventure sites that stick in the 
minds of your fellow players and become a memorable part of your ongoing
 campaign. But more than that, you can do something that no game 
designer can: You can take advantage of the traction opportunities that 
arise naturally as the game progresses. If the players have bad luck 
with the dice in a battle against bugbears, then run afoul of a tougher 
band of bugbears later in that adventure, they're probably building up 
animosity toward bugbears. You can play up the "oh, how we hate the 
crafty bugbears!" angle and bingo! You've got a monster with traction, 
not just two unrelated encounters with bugbears. When you see something 
gaining traction, help it out. Reintroduce it later, or give it a more 
important spot in the ongoing narrative.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Give Your Favorite Monster Traction</b></p>
<p align="left">Is there a monster from recent books (since 2000, say) 
that you think deserves traction? A monster that gained traction in your
 ongoing game and would probably be the "next githyanki" if everyone 
gave it a chance? Let us know. We've designed some monsters with the 
explicit intent of giving them traction, and we suspect that others are 
on the cusp of "traction-hood." No hints on which ones; we're curious 
whether you pick the same monsters.</p>

<p align="left"><b>About the Authors</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Design: </b><b>David Noonan</b> is a designer/developer for Wizards of the Coast. His credits include co-designing <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II, Heroes of Battle, </i>and numerous products for the <i>Eberron</i> campaign setting. He lives in Washington state with his wife, son, and daughter.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Development: Jesse Decker (male human, CR 1/8):</b> I first picked up a d20 somewhere in the early eighties, and I often tell the story of my intro to <b>D&amp;D</b>.
 I was in elementary school, and a friend received the now famous "red 
box" set as a gift from his parents. I was instantly hooked, and soon 
became a regular haunt of the one hobby bookshop here in Renton, WA. 
Fast forward through some-teen years of gaming (with occasional 
interruptions for things like school), and just out of college I land a 
job as editorial assistant for <i>Dragon</i> Magazine. The eight years since that entrance to the gaming industry have included a two-year stint as editor-in-chief of <i>Dragon</i>, freelance design credits such as <i>Hammer &amp; Helm</i>, and <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>.</p>
<p align="left">In the middle of 2003, I left the helm of <i>Dragon</i> for a chance to do full-time design in Wizards' R&amp;D group, and was lucky enough to work on books like <i>Complete Adventurer</i> and the <i>DMG II</i>.
 I clearly liked to talk too much to remain on the design team, so I 
moved over to manage the relatively new development team for RPGs and <b>D&amp;D</b> Minis.</p>
<p align="left">It's easily the best job in the whole world, but even 
so, I swear that as soon as I level up I'm taking the Talk Less in Class
 feat.</p>
