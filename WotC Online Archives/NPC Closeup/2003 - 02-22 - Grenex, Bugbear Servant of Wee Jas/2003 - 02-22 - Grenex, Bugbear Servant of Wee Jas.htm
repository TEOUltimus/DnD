<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2002-22%20-%20Grenex,%20Bugbear%20Servant%20of%20Wee%20Jas_files/Weejas_symbol.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="139" width="200">Grenex's
 tribe was a vicious pack of bugbears that prowled the woods and hills 
close to the civilized lands. She was the daughter of the pack's 
warlord, which gave her little true status, other than to avoid overt 
predations by the others. Grenex, though small, willowy, and lacking in 
the apparent ferocity and strength of her kin, displayed minor magical 
powers. However, her tribe never learned of her potential because it was
 waylaid and completely destroyed after an ambush they had planned 
against a caravan turned out to be an ambush itself. Grenex was the sole
 survivor of the botched raid since she was strapped to the back of her 
mother and not an immediate target during the fray. Her persistent 
mewling after all the bugbear adults were destroyed caught the attention
 of the caravan's commander, who prepared to kill the runt. Before he 
could, however, the wizard that accompanied the mercenaries stopped him.
 The wizard, Simal, saw some potential in Grenex and asked the commander
 to spare her life. The commander reluctantly agreed after Simal 
explained that he needed the bugbear for some experimentation.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Simal
 took Grenex back to his home and kept her as a slave. As he had 
promised, he used the young bugbear as a test subject for some mild 
experiments. Little did he know, however, that Grenex watched his 
magical technique with great interest and began picking up minor spells.
 After witnessing one of her displays, Simal released Grenex and made 
her his apprentice. The relationship was very hard on the young bugbear 
since her master was a stern and cruel man. However, Simal was very 
thorough in his teachings and was quietly pleased with her progress. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Simal
 was a devout worshipper of Wee Jas, the Stern Mistress of Magic and 
Death. His teachings were peppered with the lessons and words of Wee Jas
 -- the young bugbear absorbed everything that she could and soon became
 an adherent to the ways of Wee Jas. Simal was studying the necromantic 
arts and spent most of his time finding ways to summon spirits and 
create undead more efficiently. Grenex kept her opinions to herself and 
realized that she had more talent in that regard than her master. She 
kept a hidden journal and spellbook, cobbled together from her own 
findings as well as from secrets that she stole from Simal's notes. She 
was careful to take only what Simal wouldn't notice, and more than a few
 times, she risked being caught when pilfering an important component 
for a spell that she wanted to experiment with.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">After
 several years of servitude and learning, Grenex was troubled by 
disturbing nightmares. While dreaming, she was visited by a tall, 
beautiful woman who explained that it was time for the next step of her 
training. After a week, the woman finally said that she must now 
"surpass" her master. The next morning, Grenex woke early and dripped a 
poison into her master's sleeping mouth. The last thing he saw was his 
pupil standing above him, watching his demise with a cold, clinical 
interest. She grabbed what she could and set fire to the manor. As the 
glorious building burned up, Grenex watched with dispassion until it was
 nothing more than smoldering embers. She then set off into the mist, 
hoping never to return. Fate would have different plans for her, 
however.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20030222a&amp;page=2">Grenex, Servant of Wee Jas Clr 4/Wiz 1 (CR 6)</a></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">For
 many years, Grenex wandered about the land, trying to distance herself 
from her past and learning as much as she could about magic, the dead, 
and her dark mistress, Wee Jas. On occasion, her goddess would speak to 
her in her dreams, providing vague guidance and suggestions. Grenex 
never questioned these directives, even when they brought her back to 
the burned manor house. Once there, she located the charred corpse of 
Simal, still buried in the rubble of the manor. Using her new talents, 
she summoned his spirit repeatedly for many months. She interrogated his
 tortured soul and learned the remaining magical secrets that he had 
kept to himself.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">As
 soon as she had finished, however, Grenex caught sight of an 
approaching force and recognized the banner of her mentor's allies. 
Grenex fled and was hounded by the band. She never knew how they had 
found her or why they chose that moment to come for her, until another 
series of dreams made her realize that she was being tested by Wee Jas. 
She hid as well as she could and did her best to pick off the attackers 
one by one. The final battle was concluded after she created undead from
 the fallen adventurers and had them slay their former compatriots. When
 the last of the adventurers were slain, Grenex felt deep in her heart 
that she had passed Wee Jas's test. However, the battles had left her 
wounded and seriously hardened. What little bit of remorse, compassion, 
and sanity was wiped away, leaving her a cold, vicious being with no 
regard for others.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20030222a&amp;page=3">Grenex, Student of Wee Jas Clr 5/Wiz 4 (CR 11)</a></b></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Emboldened
 by her success, Grenex embarked on several adventures of her own to 
raise money, gain knowledge, and discover items of power. She returned 
once more to the burnt-down manor so that she could rebuild it. She 
raised an army of undead to augment the mercenaries that she hired from 
outside the realm, including another band of bugbears that had assumed 
the power vacuum left behind by her former tribe. To gain control, 
Grenex had to engage in combat with the leader of the tribe, whom she 
killed and then raised to act as an enforcer of her will. Her second act
 was to ritually murder the tribe's cleric of Hruggek, seeing him as a 
threat to her rule. The other bugbears bowed to her leadership and did 
whatever was asked.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">With
 this combined might, she terrorized the surrounding countryside, 
bringing it into her newly formed kingdom. She personally hunted down 
wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and anyone else that possessed magical 
powers. She tortured and interrogated them, gleaning any insights that 
she could for her dark mistress. As her might grew, the local populace 
caused several uprisings, hoping to overthrow the bugbear. She crushed 
these rebellions with a cold, logical calm, using the bodies to create 
new undead to bolster her army. Many adventurers, clerics, and paladins 
came to her land, hoping to defeat such an evil being. In the end, they 
were murdered, enslaved, or turned into more undead.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">To
 this day, Grenex is still in command of the land, ruling from the newly
 built manor and protected by a veritable army of undead and bugbears. 
Few have the power or will to take her on. She has shifted her focus to 
finding even more powerful necromantic magic and hopes to create an army
 large enough to move into the neighboring kingdom.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Grenex
 continues to summon the spirit of Simal from time to time so that she 
can learn things from beyond the grave, gain spells he may have 
"neglected" to teach her, and torment him. His spirit is tortured beyond
 compare and he wishes nothing more than to be freed from her control 
and to bring about her death.</span></p>
