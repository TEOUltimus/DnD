<p align="left"><b>Rurik Soulforge, Psion Emergent: </b>From an early 
age, Rurik knew he was different from his brethren. Young dwarven 
warriors learned the way of the hammer and the axe. Rurik sat in dark 
caverns alone, quietly contemplating a growing inner light. Young 
dwarven clerics read and copied scripture from large stone tablets. So, 
Rurik chipped away at the stone around him, carving it with pure focused
 will. All young dwarves learned to craft the hardest metals, forging 
weapons, armor, and tools like no other race can. In this alone, Rurik 
shared something in common with those around him. He is still a dwarf 
after all. Aware of his growing psionic abilities, Rurik believed 
himself to be a sorcerer of some kind, drawing from inner strength to do
 magic. However, those he studied with believed that the power of 
Rurik's intellect was far superior to that of his personality, which is 
something more common in wizards. This caused a great deal of confusion 
in the elders of Rurik's clan, since their understanding of Rurik's 
capabilities defied everything they knew about magic, whether studied or
 innate. Rurik's confusion, and a general lack of acceptance, caused him
 to depart from his homeland at the tender age of 40. He delved deep 
into the Underdark, hoping that solitude might grant him the peace 
required to discover the source of his growing powers.</p>
<p align="left">Solitude was not what he found however. It wasn't long 
before he stumbled across an elderly gnome, who was carving the most 
intricate patterns in the side of a large stone cavern -- though he did 
this with the power of his mind, and not with chisel and mallet. Rurik 
watched for some time, oblivious to the fact that the diminutive psion 
was aware of his every move. It wasn't long before the gnome approached 
the young dwarf, who believed himself to be hidden cleverly in a natural
 limestone alcove. The gnome introduced himself as Bintil (most 
assuredly a nickname for a gnome) and invited young Rurik to join him. 
The two spoke at some length, and it wasn't long before Rurik realized 
that Bintil could teach him more about his growing powers, and he even 
enjoyed the quick patter of the elderly gnome's voice, which seemed 
energetic and at the same time calming. Many years passed and Rurik 
learned from Bintil. The two roamed the Underdark, leaving carven 
markers on the walls that declared their presence openly to the other 
denizens of that world, even if unseen.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Rurik Soulforge, Underdark Explorer:</b> As Rurik 
grew more comfortable with his psionic powers, he ventured out on his 
own to explore and observe those with whom they shared the Underdark. In
 his travels, he discovered the drow and duergar, neither race was 
particularly friendly, though if approached with caution, they could be 
traded and conversed with. Bintil warned him that prolonged contact with
 these two races always led to suffering, and so he admonished Rurik for
 being too trusting and hoped that he might meet with these other 
peoples as infrequently as possible. Unconvinced, at one point, Rurik 
stumbled across a band of kuo-toa, and their strange habit of enslaving 
or eating all non-kuo-toa led to their demise as Rurik battled their 
group while attempting to escape their nets. Unfortunately, it wasn't 
long after this incident that Rurik stumbled into his first mind flayer.
 Nearly paralyzed with fright, Rurik barely escaped from that encounter 
with his life. Soon after, he found Bintil and described the encounter, 
though he was shocked at the gnome's stricken reaction. Bintil had never
 before displayed fear so openly. The gnome made Rurik promise that he 
would be careful to avoid further contact with the illithid. If they 
were to discover the two psions, they might decide to come after them in
 force.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately for them, the mind flayer took news back 
to his city of a strange psionic dwarf. Worried that there may be more 
of them, the mind flayers formed an inquisition whose sole task was to 
find the dwarf and any companions, and slay them before they could bring
 more psionic dwarves into the area. Unfortunately, the inquisition 
stumbled upon Bintil while carving alone in a cavern. The gnome put up 
quite a fight, but the combined might of the illithid inquisition was 
too much for him. After a day of gathering mushrooms, Rurik returned to 
the cave where Bintil was working. There, he discovered his friend dead,
 slumped over a large rock formation, his brain missing. Enraged, Rurik 
tracked down the inquisition, and using subterfuge, picked them off one 
by one. It wasn't long before the leader fell dead, with Rurik's 
psychokinetic spear protruding from his chest. That day, Rurik began his
 crusade against the mind flayers, destroying all that were foolish 
enough to venture too far away from their city.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Rurik Soulforge, Illithid-Bane: </b>Rurik has hunted 
the illithids for many years, and even now at the age of 80, he relishes
 in their destruction. It isn't uncommon for the dwarf psion to recruit 
adventurers from the surface world to assist him in his hunt, especially
 when large forces of mind flayers are on the move for whatever fell 
purpose they might have. Rurik doesn't spend a great deal of time 
attempting to fathom the thoughts of such creatures, believing them to 
be far too alien and evil to fully comprehend. He would rather just hunt
 them down and destroy them, making them incapable of attacking the 
innocent or unwary ever again. He frequently looks for ways to hinder 
their activities, and he is always looking for the day that he might 
enter their city and destroy their precious elder brain.</p>
