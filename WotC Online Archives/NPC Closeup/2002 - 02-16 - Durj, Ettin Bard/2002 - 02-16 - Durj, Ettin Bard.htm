<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2002-16%20-%20Durj,%20Ettin%20Bard_files/MM_20010216_ettin_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="252" width="233">Continuation
 of the species is one of the few reasons that ettins live together for a
 short period of time. A male and female ettin reside together until 
their child has matured enough to be self-sufficient. This, at least, is
 the normal plan in ettin society. Durj's parents, however, were not so 
lucky...</p>
<p class="size2">Shortly after his birth, Durj lost his father, Robbob, 
to the seductive call of sirens. Not wanting to lose her only son to 
these enchantresses, Durj's mother, Suellin, decided to move their home 
to a location away from the sea. So, she packed up the cave and traveled
 inland to a forest that abutted a swamp. Deep in the heart of the 
forest, under the roots of a very old tree, Suellin dug out a new home 
for Durj and herself. Once settled in, Suellin and Durj lived quite well
 on the abundance of forest life available for their pickings.</p>
<p class="size2">Things in the forest, however, didn't remain peaceful 
for long. The forest's sylvan denizens were outraged at the addition of 
the ettin family to their peaceful existence. So, they banded together 
and harassed both Suellin and Durj whenever the opportunity presented 
itself. Needless to say, the ettins viewed the behavior being displayed 
by their food as unacceptable. Suellin, being a protective mother, 
decided that while Durj was sleeping, she needed to strike back at the 
offending morsels. In doing so, however, she fell right into the sylvan 
creature's trap. A male Satyr -- the bait for the trap -- lured Suellin 
to her demise using his magical panpipes. </p>
<p class="size2">Durj, then only about three months old, awoke alone and
 hungry with dusk swiftly approaching. With his mother nowhere to be 
found and his stomach growling fiercely, Durj wandered into the woods in
 search of something to eat. Following his superior sense of hearing, 
Durj chased animals around the forest until, standing in the dark of 
night, he suddenly realized that he no longer knew how to get back to 
the safety of his home. This scared the ettin youth. His hunger 
temporarily forgotten, the young ettin set out trying to find his home. 
Durj wandered through the woods into the wee hours of the morning. Every
 now and then, thinking that he heard his mother's call, Durj would rush
 off in that direction only to find that it was the hoot of an owl or 
the rustling of some nocturnal creature. After one such occurrence, Durj
 found himself standing knee-deep in stagnant water. </p>
<p class="size2">Alone, hungry, and now wet, Durj was quickly losing his
 hope of ever finding home again. Still lost, new dangers presented 
themselves in the darkness of the swamp at night. Fallen trees and 
bushes took on the form of monsters out to eat poor Durj. Bullfrogs and 
owls added growling and howling voices to the monsters of the swamp. Not
 knowing what else to do, Durj took off running as fast as he could and 
crashed through the swampy brush. </p>
<p class="size2">Suddenly, he spotted lights dancing through the trees 
off to his left. Thinking that this may be help, or at least a source of
 food, Durj decided to investigate. As slowly and quietly as an ettin 
could be, he followed the lights and hoped to catch a glimpse of their 
source. As soon as he was certain that he had caught his would-be meal, 
Durj would spring out from behind a tree only to find the lights gone. 
Looking around, the lights would reappear a little ways off. Thus passed
 the remainder of the night.</p>
<p class="size2">Morning found Durj asleep in the hollow bowl of a 
rotten tree. In relative shelter from the monsters of the swamp, he 
gorged himself on the insects that had made the tree their home. Thus 
sated, he fell asleep nestled within the soft peat. Later that day, the 
mistresses of the swamp, a covey of green hags, found the slumbering 
ettin youth and, celebrating their find, took the sleeping ettin back to
 their lair. Once Durj finally awakened, he found himself in a dark, 
cavernous structure. The hags, not quite sure how to approach the ettin 
youth, decided that enchantment would offer the most opportunities. Due 
to his youth and inexperience, Durj easily fell under the spell of the 
hags. </p>
<p class="size2">During the five months it took for him to fully mature,
 Durj learned how to protect the swamp because of lessons taught by the 
hags' other protectors, which was a group of four ogres. He learned to 
fight and terrify from the ogres while his mistresses taught Durj to 
speak Hag. Durj, it seemed, was far more intelligent than typical for 
his race. So, the hags weren't very surprised when Durj started 
inquiring about his past. Using their divinations, the hags retold the 
story of his youth. They started with the loss of his father to sirens, 
using their sound mimicry to include a snippet of the sirens' seductive 
melody. Of course, without the sirens actually producing the melody, the
 music did little but make Durj remember more. Later, they continued the
 tale with his mother's demise due to the magic of the satyr's panpipes.
 Again the hags augmented the tale with the haunting sounds of music. 
Finally, the trio retold the tale of the night they found Durj, 
reproducing the nocturnal sounds of the swamp.</p>
<p class="size2">As the tale unfolded, the attentive Durj took note of 
the influence sound had played on his life. Twice sound, or more 
pointedly music, had been used to lure his parents to their demise. He 
had also personally born witness to the fearful effects of the sounds of
 the unknown. At that point, Durj decided that he wanted to know more 
about sound, music, and magic. </p>
<p class="size2">For the remainder of the first year of his life, Durj 
spent time with the hags learning the "music" the swamp's denizens made 
on a regular basis. He also asked his mistresses for information about 
enchantment magic. The hags, fearful that he would find out about the 
enchantment they placed on him, refused to impart any knowledge about 
magic. So vehemently had they responded to Durj's inquiries, that he 
never again broached the subject with any of his mistresses. His 
curiosity, however, prompted the ettin to experiment into the realm of 
arcane magic alone. </p>
<p class="size2">Durj's protective duties included raiding into the 
forest to keep the sylvan creatures from wandering into the swamp. After
 a few successful raids, the hags decided to send Durj on longer and 
longer excursions. One such excursion was to make a delivery to a nearby
 encampment of hill giants. The letter, which Durj thought was a request
 for supplies, was actually a letter of introduction to the leader of 
the encampment. The hags, you see, wanted Durj to learn more about 
music. They thought that if he could learn to inspire their other 
protectors, then they would have a more efficient fighting force. </p>
<p class="size2">Under the tutelage of the hill giants, Durj learned how
 to inspire courage in his allies with his music. There were two main 
instruments the hill giants used in their campaigns: drums created a 
cadence for their troops, and a lur inspired courage in the troops once 
battle was joined. The lur, a typical giant musical instrument, is a 
large horn about 8 feet long weighting approximately 50 pounds. After 
learning everything the hill giants could teach him, Durj was offered 
his choice of either a drum or a lur prior to leaving the hill giant 
encampment.</p>
<p class="size2">Returning triumphantly to the swamp with his new 
musical abilities and a lur with which to use them, Durj immediately 
looked for other things he could do with music. Using the lur as a 
focus, he found that he could fascinate the denizens of the swamp. So, 
Durj practiced and practiced with the lur until he could mingle his 
arcane mutterings with the music he was creating. Durj continued his 
protective duties, inspiring his allied ogres to great feats, and 
succeeding at many raiding missions, in the name of the hag covey. </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p class="size2">Over the next couple of years, he became quite adept in
 fusing his music with arcane magic. In fact, Durj could now use his 
music to counter spells, inspire competence in his allies, and even 
entwine suggestions into his musical tales. This, coupled with the 
feeling that the hags were holding him back from his true calling caused
 him to confront them. With his ogre companions under the enchantment of
 his music, and his ability to counter the magic of the hags with his 
muscial talents, he easily defeated the hags.</p>
<p class="size2">Proclaiming himself the new ruler of the swamp, he 
immediately initiated a campaign to rid the nearby forest of the sylvan 
creatures that had caused his mother's death. With the combination of 
Durj's music and his ogre minions, the sylvan denizens of the forest 
were driven off. This, however, was not enough to satisfy the ettin. 
There happened to be a road that passed not a mile from the edge of the 
swamp, and many caravans passed along this trail carrying goods to and 
from a nearby village. </p>
<p class="size2">Late at night, after most of the caravans made camp for
 the night, Durj set about creating enchanting music that would carry on
 the winds to the caravan encampments. Hearing the music, guards and 
merchants alike would stray from the safety of their campsites and fall 
under the thrall of the ettin. Durj, however, would not kill his 
captives right away for being a crafty ettin, he knew he could learn 
from his captives. Once the captives held no more interest for the 
ettin, he could feed them to his ogres. </p>
<p class="size2">After about a year, the local lords hired a band of 
adventurers to investigate the reduction in trade passing the swamp. The
 lords, however, never saw nor heard from the adventurers again once 
they had ventured into the swamp. Durj, and his little band of ogres, 
grew in might and magic from the frequent feasts visited upon them by 
the local lords. </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p class="size2">At some point, since none who ventured into the swamp 
were ever seen again, rumors began circulating through the nearby inns 
and villages. It was said that by night the enchanting music of the 
"Swamp Ghost" lured the unwary to their doom. From then on, only the 
most foolhardy, or the unlucky, ventured into, or even near, the 
"haunted" swamp. </p>
<p class="size2">Even though the amount of travel near the swamp had 
abated, foolish adventurers who thought themselves more than capable 
continued to pour into the swamp. The promise of years of accumulated 
treasure, and the possibility of ridding the world of a significant 
source of evil, proved quite a source of temptation. Few of the 
adventurers who entered the swamp returned with their lives. Those who 
escaped the clutches of the "Swamp Ghost" considered themselves lucky. 
Most usually retired after the harrowing experience. None ever ventured 
near the swamp again.</p>
<p class="size2">With his source of entertainment, information, and food
 thus diminished, Durj became bored. Considering the swamp relatively 
safe from intruders, he turned his attention to the world beyond his 
demesnes. This attention came in Durj's desire to rid the world of those
 who shaped the course of his childhood. For Durj, ridding the local 
forest of the sylvan races was only the first step in his revenge. With 
this in mind, he sent a message to the leader of the hill giant 
encampment where he learned his trade so long ago. The message to the 
hill giants was an invitation to live in greener pastures. </p>
<p class="size2">Durj had offered the nearby forest to the hill giants 
as a military installation. This mutually beneficial arrangement would 
allow Durj to work in tandem with the hill giants on their military 
objectives while leaving the swamp protected by the significant might of
 the hill giant army. The hill giants, understanding the benefit of this
 arrangement, came to live in the forest near the swamp. As they both 
agreed, whenever the hill giants marched, they carried with them the 
bolstering songs of the "Swamp Ghost".</p>
