 Avarian's life is a story of tragedy and courage, of great losses 
sustained and great temptations withstood. Above all, it is the story of
 the triumph of a human soul over evil.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 she was seven years old, Sophia was orphaned during an orc raid on her 
village. A force of warriors led by a group of paladins of Heironeous 
arrived to drive the orcs away, but they came too late to save the young
 girl's parents. An elderly cleric named Cidel found Sophia with a 
bloody kitchen knife in her hand, standing over the body of a goblin. 
Nearby lay the bodies of her mother and father. Her eyes were full of 
rage and as Cidel watched, the young girl continued to stab the goblin's
 corpse.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cidel
 was filled with pity for Sophia and, since the girl had no living 
family, he made her a ward of Heironeous's church. For weeks after the 
attack, she would not speak to anyone. It was all Cidel could do to 
wrest the knife from her small hands. When she finally began to converse
 again, she told Cidel how she'd hidden from the orcs under a bushel 
basket while they murdered her parents. Then she told him of the goblin 
that followed the orcs, scavenging dead bodies for whatever the larger 
monsters left behind. She told him how she'd surprised the vile creature
 with a knife in its back and how she'd gone on to butcher the thing. 
Her voice, as she spoke, was cold, distant, and full of bitter hate.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Cidel
 knew that the girl would need guidance if she was to ever control or 
channel her hatred. He taught her the ways of Heironeous: justice, 
honor, and strength. He placed her feet firmly on the path of 
righteousness and, under his firm but loving hand, Sophia grew up to be 
one of Heironeous's finest paladins.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20030622a&amp;page=2"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sophia, Paladin 5</b></span></a></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="2003%20-%2006-22%20-%20Sophia,%20Paladin%20Who%20Seeks%20Justice_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Sophia, Knight Errant</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Still,
 Sophia struggled with the anger that continued to fester inside her. 
She longed for justice, and she used her strength to protect the weak 
from all evil threats -- evil humans, goblinoids, and other monsters. 
But she also longed for vengeance. Orcs and goblins above all else were 
the target of her wrath, and she hunted them at every opportunity. When 
the time came to fight her hated enemies, Sophia slaughtered them with a
 glee that was almost unholy. Many times, the aging Cidel had to steer 
the young woman back to the right path. More than once, the old man 
assigned his foster daughter a tedious atonement when she returned from a
 gruesome bloodbath waged against orcs or goblins.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 time, the girl began to understand the lessons set out by her foster 
father. She began to reign in her anger. Then, in a cruel twist of fate,
 Cidel was murdered by followers of Hextor.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Faced
 again with the loss of her family, Sophia's rage knew no bounds. She 
hunted down these followers of Hextor and killed every one of them. But 
this did not quell her anger. She went on to find the small temple of 
Hextor that had dispatched these murderers. She charged into the temple 
during a ceremony and proceeded to slaughter everyone present -- men and
 women, weak and strong, old and young all fell before her flashing 
sword. When the killing was done, blood ran ankle-deep across the temple
 floor.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 wanton destruction attracted the attention of another evil god: 
Erythnul the Many. The god of slaughter appeared to the blood-soaked 
girl and offered her a deal: If she would turn and worship him, he would
 provide her with opportunities for vengeance against all those who had 
wronged her.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Burning
 with rage and confronted by a deity who seemed willing to allow her 
rage full reign, Sophia's faith wavered. She considered joining Erythnul
 and taking up the path of the blackguard, forever abandoning the path 
of Heironeous.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20030622a&amp;page=3"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Sophia, Paladin 10</b></span></a></li>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Sophia, the Balanced</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sophia
 reached out to clasp the hand of Erythnul the Many. Then, just as she 
was about to accept the evil deity's offer, she caught sight of her holy
 symbol, which had fallen from her belt and now lay in a pool of human 
blood on the temple floor. A wave of remorse overwhelmed the young 
woman, and she cried out in unspeakable agony. She grabbed the holy 
symbol and fled from the temple.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sophia
 rode deep into the wilderness. For decades she wandered as a nameless 
knight errant, never staying in one place for longer than a fortnight. 
She ate only what she could scavenge or beg for. She carried little but 
her weapons and raised them only in the cause of absolute justice -- and
 even then, reluctantly. The years began to show on Sophia's face, and 
lines of pain and wisdom etched around her eyes and mouth. She prayed 
frequently to Heironeous and asked that he cleanse her soul and make her
 pure enough to follow his path once more.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finally,
 the spirit of Cidel came to her in a dream. He told Sophia that she had
 done her penance many times over, that her deity had long since 
forgiven her, and that she needed now to forgive herself. Having found 
peace at last, Sophia returned to the temple where Cidel had raised her 
and joined the ranks of Heironeous's paladins and lifted her sword once 
more in the name of justice -- but never thereafter in the name of 
vengeance.</span></p>
