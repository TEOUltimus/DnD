<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Merath Silvershorn, Reckless Youth</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2007-29%20-%20Merath%20Silentstride,%20Puppet%20of%20Fate_files/cc_july03_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="240" width="200">Born
 to aristocratic and wealthy parents, Merath Silvershorn grew up among 
the spoiled and feckless youths of high society. Granted every desire, 
and shielded from the consequences of her mistakes, she never understood
 life. Her parents might have wanted to keep her innocent of the world, 
but in truth they were inattentive and busy with their own social and 
financial ambitions. They believed that money was an acceptable 
substitute for love and did not pay attention to Merath as long as she 
did not cause a serious embarrassment for them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 might be expected, Merath's freewheeling lifestyle led her into 
trouble. When she was fourteen years old, she was already involved with 
drinking and carousing with the children of other nobles. By this age 
she was almost considered an adult and given considerably more freedom 
than she enjoyed as a child. Her associations and revelries bored her 
eventually. She sought out more exciting pastimes and found herself 
gradually associating with a rougher crowd. Many of her friends at this 
time were nobles also seeking excitement, but into this circle of 
friends came some who were more interested in her money than her 
friendship. One of these suggested that thievery would be very exciting 
and enticed her into the trade. Her early failures were covered over by 
her family, or by "friends" in the local guild, and eventually she grew 
more skilled.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But,
 fate took a hand as she turned nineteen years old. She planned a 
robbery of the temple of Heironeous, and during this daring raid 
Olidamarra the Laughing Rogue abandoned her. She was caught and thrown 
into prison.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Merath the Quiet, Royal Spy</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 the king needs something delicate accomplished, he turns to his 
spymaster. When the spymaster needs something done that is too risky, he
 seeks out expendable people for the task. Such a need arose three 
months after Merath was put in prison; an artifact of the royal house 
was stolen and taken to a neighboring country. Since the artifact was 
tied to the image of the king's success, it needed to be recovered as 
quietly as possible. After reviewing the known facts about the people in
 the prison, the royal spymaster brought her out and offered her freedom
 in exchange for a small task. Binding her to his service by a magical <i>geas</i>,
 he sent her on her way expecting her to fail. He had planned to use the
 failure to his personal advantage. She surprised him and succeeded, 
restoring the artifact to his hands. Thus began her service to the king,
 albeit through the spymaster's organization.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Merath
 worked for the king's spymaster for more than ten years, some of it 
unwillingly. She would never have chosen this line of work for herself, 
and she did not always like the danger. As a youth, she was protected 
from the real consequences of her actions. Now, she knew that missteps 
meant death or torture or imprisonment. The spymaster said that should 
she be captured, she would be rescued so that she could not pass on her 
knowledge to an enemy, but this was not the same kind of protection she 
had enjoyed. Her parents thought her dead, since the spymaster had 
circulated a story of her demise at the hands of half-orcs in the 
prison, so she could not turn to them. She was, effectively, reliant 
entirely on the spymaster. After a couple years, the <i>geas</i> spells 
stopped, but she was used to the life of a spy and royal thief so she 
kept at it. She was also given access to training and gained in magical 
power during these years.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Merath Silentstride, Bitter and Disillusioned Mercenary</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After
 thirteen years of service, she went on a mission with the spymaster, 
and he was killed covering her escape with the information that they 
sought. The new spymaster, a woman, was a very different sort of person.
 Without even evaluating the service of the former spymaster's agents, 
she brought in many of her own people and sent the former spymaster's 
chosen agents on missions that caused their deaths. Thus, she purged the
 old agents without any overt signs of doing so. Merath's turn to be 
purged came a year after the new spymaster took charge. Merath, by this 
time a talented arcane trickster and experienced agent, was sent on 
perhaps the most dangerous mission ever conceived. While deep undercover
 she was betrayed by an agent of the new spymaster, and then she was 
abandoned to die. She escaped, but did not return to her old employer. 
Instead, she fled to the west and began to take whatever jobs came to 
hand. Again, just as she had achieved some measure of security, the 
Laughing Rogue had abandoned her.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Her
 old employers know she is alive, and occasionally one comes to make 
sure she is not a further threat to the new spymaster, an ambitious 
woman who plans to overthrow the king and assume the throne for herself.
 Merath is too disillusioned now to do anything about this. Filled with 
bitterness at how her life has turned out, she lives from moment to 
moment seeking some kind of security or control. She cannot return home,
 and she cannot seem to find a place for herself that is lasting. If she
 were offered a place of security, even in marriage, she would probably 
jump at the chance, even though part of her would remain disbelieving. 
She would always worry that somehow she would be abandoned by fate yet 
again.</span></p>
