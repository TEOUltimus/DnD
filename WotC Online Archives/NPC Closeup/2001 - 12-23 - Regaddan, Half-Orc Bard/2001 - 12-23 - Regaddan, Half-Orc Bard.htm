 from birth, Regaddan has endured a tough life. His mother left him on a
 hillside to die soon after he was born, but he was found and raised at 
an orphanage by a group of priests of Fharlanghn (god of travel). The 
teachings of these priests had a lasting impact on the young boy, and 
this was the only time in his life where he really ever felt at home. At
 the age of eight, he was "adopted" by an orc chieftain who took 
momentary pity on one of his own race being raised by humans. Passed to 
one of the chieftain's mistresses to be raised, he suffered neglect and 
occasionally outright hatred from his adoptive "mother." The chieftain 
paid no attention to him at all, except to arrange that he be trained to
 fight well. He chose the greatsword and at the young age (by human 
standards) of 14 became one of his adoptive father's personal guards.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20011223b">Regaddan, Ftr1 (CR 1)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b><i> Yearning for Music</i></b></p>
<p class="size2">Regaddan was miserably unhappy and turned to music as 
solace. He had acquired an old mandolin from the priests upon his 
adoption, and he learned to play it when neglect and hatred caused him 
to be left alone. Other orcs laughed at him and ridiculed him, for truly
 he was unskilled at the mandolin and the orcs preferred chants and drum
 music, but they did not get rough because Regaddan was the son of the 
chief. He served as a chieftain's guard for a few years, but was never 
really happy in this role. The discipline and strict requirements did 
not suit him, and he was forced to guard a chieftain that he did not 
like. Thus, music became his friend, and he practiced singing and 
playing without any real idea what he was doing.</p>
<p class="size2">Liberation from this life came when a rival tribe of 
orcs attacked the chieftain's travel party. The chieftain -- his 
adoptive father -- was killed, along with most of the guards. Regaddan 
survived, hovering near death. The orcs from his own tribe who found him
 left him for dead on the field as punishment for allowing the chief to 
die. He would have perished but for a kindly but hungry bard who passed 
by and started to loot the remaining bodies. He found Regaddan hanging 
on to life, and the presence of the mandolin in his pack interested the 
bard enough in this strange half-orc to save him. Regaddan went to live 
with the bard, who was delighted to have a student who loved music so 
much.</p>
<p class="size2">The next few years brought wandering, training in the 
harp and pipes, singing, and the art of storytelling. Regaddan had a 
remarkably good voice, especially for a half-orc, and the bard trained 
him as best as he could. Eventually though, the bard tired of Regaddan 
and left him in the middle of the night.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20011223c">Regaddan, Ftr2/Brd4 (CR 6)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b><i> Love and Loss</i></b></p>
<p class="size2">The seeds of Regaddan's childhood began to show after 
his mentor abandoned him. Regaddan became alternately aloof and clingy. 
He silently cried out for affection, but when real friendship was 
offered he would back off emotionally to protect himself from the loss 
that he knew was coming. Thus, people who might have been his friends 
perceived him as cold and sometimes unfriendly, and passed by. He allied
 himself with an adventuring party for a while, but internal conflict 
caused this group to break up a few months after he joined. Again, he 
was on his own.</p>
<p class="size2">The life of a bard suited him well, and when not 
adventuring he could be found in almost any town entertaining. Some 
races had trouble at first with the concept of a half-orc bard, but his 
talents won most audiences over and he made a reasonably good living. He
 was never famous, because as word spread of his abilities and fame 
approached, his insecurities would surface and tell him, "They cannot 
really like you; they will abandon you like everyone else has." So he 
would depart that place and wander again.</p>
<p class="size2">A tragic incident occurred just a year ago, when he 
started to make a reputation for himself in a small city. A human woman 
gave clear signs that she found him attractive, watching his 
performances night after night and talking with him afterward. As they 
got closer, he began to think about settling in that city, and the old 
voices remained curiously silent. Some derided the woman for taking up 
with a half-breed, but these comments were mostly in jest, or could be 
ignored because the people so talking were known to be bitter 
complainers.</p>
<p class="size2">It could not last. As Regaddan and the woman talked 
about wedding plans, he began to perceive that she was holding things 
back. Then she started keeping secrets and spending more time away from 
him than usual. To Regaddan, these signs bespoke a coming abandonment, 
and he withdrew emotionally. The woman, who had not been holding things 
back at all, or being secretive, saw the change in Regaddan and pushed 
him to state a reason. He would not, and his warped idea that he would 
always be abandoned had taken such a powerful but subtle hold that he 
saw her attempts to mend the relationship as exactly the opposite. 
Finally, he departed in the middle of the night, walking out on her 
before she could walk out on him. She lamented for weeks afterward, and 
never fully recovered. Somewhere she lives and loves him still, holding 
out a diminishing hope that he will return.</p>
