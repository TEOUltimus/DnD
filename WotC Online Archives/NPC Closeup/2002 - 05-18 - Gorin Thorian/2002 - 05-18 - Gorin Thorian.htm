<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2005-18%20-%20Gorin%20Thorian_files/cc_gorin.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="268" width="223"></b>Half-orcs
 exist uneasily between two worlds: the wild and often bloodthirsty 
culture of their orc parent on the one hand and the domesticated and 
frequently complex civilization of their human parent on the other. 
Gorin Thorian is one such individual. An orphan since birth, Gorin was 
adopted by a clan of good wizards, who found him abandoned in the forest
 outside their citadel. The wizards, all of whom were human, treated 
Gorin like their own child. Noticing the boy's natural intelligence, 
many of them devoted time away from their own studies to train Gorin in 
the magical arts.</p>
<p class="size2">Still, Gorin could not help but notice the differences 
between his foster parents and himself. His orc features set him apart 
from the other members of the enclave. They lacked his yellow tusks and 
coarse dark hair. They also all seemed much weaker than him, and, as 
Gorin grew up, he found himself frequently called upon to open stubborn 
jars of magic herbs or to lift heavy magic equipment that was too 
delicate to entrust to a simple <i>telekinesis</i> spell. This left 
Gorin feeling isolated and alone, for though his foster parents loved 
him, he was still not truly one of them. Because of this, his initial 
forays into arcane spellcasting all centered on ways to alter his 
appearance to more closely resemble that of the humans who surrounded 
him.</p>
<p class="size2">Gorin became sullen and withdrawn because of his 
feeling of isolation. He spent most evenings alone in the enclave 
library, devouring any books he could find that touched on orc history 
and culture. As he approached his early twenties, Gorin's only true 
friend was his familiar, a cat he had named Throkk after a mythical orc 
hero.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020518b">Gorin Thorian, Div3 (CR 3)</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020518b"></a></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2">In time, Gorin grew dissatisfied with life in the 
enclave. He could not believe that all of the things he had read about 
orcs were true: Orcs were evil and uncivilized cannibals who butchered 
other humanoid races for sport. He wanted to see them for himself, as 
well as live among them and experience their culture. His foster parents
 were sorry to see him leave, but they understood why the young man had 
to go. To help him on his journey, the wizards equipped him with a <i>ring of protection +1</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">Gorin traveled to the outlands, where he attempted to 
join the first orc tribe he encountered. The initial meeting went badly 
for Gorin at first because of his lack of combat expertise. The orcs 
attacked him, beat him badly, and killed his horse. The orc chieftain 
was about to eat Throkk for his noonday meal, when Gorin resorted to 
magic. He cast <i>fireball</i> into a group of orcs, killing many of 
them, including the tribe's adept. The orc tribe had never seen one like
 them who could use such powerful arcane magic. Convinced of Gorin's 
power and his usefulness, the orc chieftain returned Throkk to him and 
appointed him the new tribal adept.</p>
<p class="size2">Gorin spent several years among the orcs, learning 
their ways and adapting his body to the harsh conditions of the 
wilderness. He even learned to fight with the traditional double-bladed 
orc axe, though he did not take to wearing armor since it interfered 
with his spellcasting, and he never learned how to use the axe as a 
double weapon.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020518c">Gorin Thorian, Div5/Bbn3 (CR 8) </a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2">Gorin's advice and magical aptitude led the orc tribe 
to greater and greater victories, enhancing their wealth and prestige 
until they were among the most powerful in the outlands.</p>
<p class="size2">However, Gorin became increasingly disillusioned by 
life among the primitive orc tribes. He had hoped to find a noble 
warrior race living in harmony with their harsh surroundings. Instead, 
Gorin found a cruel people that was consumed by evil and dedicated to 
the violent worship of Gruumsh, the orc deity. Gorin took it upon 
himself to show the orcs a better way by counseling them to abandon 
their fruitless warfare and infighting. Gorin's views became unpopular 
with the orc chieftain, who began to feel that the wizard had outlived 
his usefulness. Gorin's magic prevailed in the end, however: The same 
divination spells that he'd used to catapult the chieftain to power also
 alerted him to the chieftain's treachery. When the chieftain struck, 
Gorin was ready. The orc warriors loyal to Gorin and the orc wizards 
Gorin had trained easily prevailed over the chieftain's forces.</p>
<p class="size2">Finding himself suddenly the ruler of a powerful orc 
clan, Gorin took stock of his life. He realized that he hadn't found 
what he'd hope to find among the orc tribes. So he turned his back on 
the traditional orc ways and, taking seven of his most promising orc 
acolytes with him, he retreated from the world to devote himself to 
magic and learning. One day, he hoped, his students would return to the 
tribes to share their wisdom and turn the orcs away from their fruitless
 existence of ignorance and bloodshed.</p>
