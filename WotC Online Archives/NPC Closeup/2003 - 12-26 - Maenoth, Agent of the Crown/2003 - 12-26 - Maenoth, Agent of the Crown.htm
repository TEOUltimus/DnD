<p align="left"><b><img src="2003%20-%2012-26%20-%20Maenoth,%20Agent%20of%20the%20Crown_files/CC_dec03_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="315" width="191">Maenoth, the Scoundrel: </b>Maenoth
 reached young adulthood on the seediest streets of the capital of one 
of the world's largest cities. Orphaned at a young age, the urchin grew 
into a handsome, talented thief. He began as many thieves do by working 
with a group of other youngsters (yet to develop more advanced thieving 
skills) mobbing well-off merchants, newcomers, or tourists. While most 
of the group yelled at the target, begging for aid or hawking worthless 
gewgaws, one of the mob picked the pockets or cut the purse strings of 
the distracted or befuddled mark.</p>
<p align="left">As he grew, Maenoth stretched his roguish wings. On 
occasion, he worked with the city's reigning thieves' guild, but the 
guild master was an evil, sadistic dwarf that didn't restrict his 
guild's activities to protection, fencing stolen goods, and robbing the 
wealthy and the noble of the city. This guild master, who called himself
 Atavic, also smuggled illegal goods, assassinated upstanding rulers for
 the right price, and engaged in a highly profitable slave trade, mainly
 in women and children. Maenoth took part in none of these operations, 
and as a result, knew he would never advance far within the guild.</p>
<p align="left">So Maenoth kept to himself, developing his skills to the
 point where he became a moderately successful thief and cat burglar. 
He'd often make friends with the young, bored daughters of wealthy 
nobles or arrogant nobles of the city and begin romances with them. With
 good looks and streetwise ways, few could resist. Once he'd been 
invited (most commonly surreptitiously) into the young woman's home, 
he'd case the joint and return on another occasion to steal all he could
 carry.</p>
<p align="left">It was on just such a return visit that Maenoth's life 
changed forever. The young damsel he had charmed this time was more than
 she seemed. She was the daughter of the king, and she was living 
incognito to protect her from the country's enemies and to ensure the 
continuation of the royal line should anything happen to her father and 
elder brother, the prince and heir. A few nights after wooing the 
lovely, auburn-haired Melisé, Maenoth snuck back into the house, only to
 be caught and soundly thrashed by Angston, a former adventuring 
companion from the king's youth and the princess's unofficial "uncle" 
and protector.</p>
<p align="left">What no one, not even Maenoth at the time, realized was 
that the trysts he had shared with Melisé planted the seeds of love in 
both their hearts. It was only later, when it was too late, that Maenoth
 realized the depths of his feelings for the gorgeous, smart (despite 
falling for his initial ploy), and funny Melisé.</p>
<p align="left">Faced with a lifetime in the royal dungeons for 
"endangering the princess's life and welfare," Maenoth took the only 
other option given him: enlistment in the royal army as Angston's 
"personal attaché." Maenoth soon learned there was much more to the big 
man than strong sword arm.</p>

<p align="left"><b><img src="2003%20-%2012-26%20-%20Maenoth,%20Agent%20of%20the%20Crown_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Maenoth, the Warrior: </b>Maenoth began his new life 
as Angston's "aide" in the royal army. Maenoth passed every test and 
succeeded at every challenge. He and Angston began to share a grudging 
respect for each other. Once Maenoth's basic training was complete, 
Angston took the young man into his trust. Angston was more than just 
the princess's protector -- he covertly worked for the king on important
 errands, missions, and quests for the good of the country and its 
people. Angston, seeing much promise in the accomplished thief and 
budding warrior, offered Maenoth a place at his side. This occupation 
sounded much more thrilling than serving the rest of his military term 
in the standard army, so Maenoth accepted Angston's offer. Maenoth's 
first assignment was to survive Angston's harsh training regimen and 
martial-technique classes.</p>
<p align="left">After a time, Angston felt his young charge was ready, 
and they re-entered active duty in the king's service. Their travels 
took them far and wide to many exotic cities, unknown lands, and deadly 
dungeons. Angston's experience and martial skills combined with 
Maenoth's roguish talents and his growing ability as a fighter made the 
pair a dangerous combination to face. In the small circle of covert 
agents, the pair gained a reputation and their fair share of enemies.</p>
<p align="left">During this time, Maenoth felt himself changing. Not 
only did he come to regard Angston as a kind of surrogate father (which 
the old warrior reciprocated, treating Maenoth as the son the bachelor 
adventurer never had), but the many injustices and horrible deeds he 
witnessed on his assignments with Angston shifted his outlook from that 
of self-interested thief to a fighter for good.</p>
<p align="left">Maenoth also found that his thoughts were turning 
increasingly often to the young Melisé, to whom he'd never had a chance 
to apologize after being caught and knocked around by Angston. He 
someday hoped to remedy that situation and told Angston of his intent to
 do so. However, before the pair could act on Maenoth's intent, they 
were called back to duty on an assignment that would change Maenoth's 
life again.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Maenoth, the King's Agent:</b> Angston and Maenoth's 
mission this time was to uncover the traitors behind an alleged plot to 
kill King Stefan and his son Prince Philip. Thus, the cabal of 
treasonous individuals hoped to rule the kingdom by controlling a 
handpicked puppet. The heroic duo discovered the plot was real and that 
at least one member of the royal household had thrown in with the 
plotters. The Court Wizard (and Director Emeritus of the Royal Magery 
Academy) was to betray and kill the royal father and son while the group
 was on an annual family hunting expedition to the mountains. They 
wanted to make the attack look like an assassination attempt by the 
thieves' guild in the capital city, which had been in an uproar after a 
recent royal crack-down on corruption in city officials. If the 
traitors' plan worked, not only would the government wipe out the guild 
to revenge the king's and prince's deaths, it would create a power 
vacuum in the city's underworld that the plotters could also then fill 
with a new organization of their own. By controlling both the new 
legitimate monarch and the largest criminal group in the country's 
largest city, the plotters hoped their grip on the country would be 
unshakable.</p>
<p align="left">Maenoth and Angston acted in time to halt this vile 
plan, but only barely. By the time the pair reached the hunting retreat 
in the mountains, the villainous Court Wizard had already acted. He'd 
poisoned most of the royal household staff's breakfasts that morning and
 escorted the royal family on a hunt himself. The heroic duo reached the
 chalet after the hunting party left and found the servants dead or 
dying. Maenoth and Angston rode hard to catch the hunting party: Angston
 to save his lifelong friend, the king, and Maenoth to save the woman he
 now realized he loved, Melisé.</p>
<p align="left">Meanwhile the Court Wizard, then known as Tursas, 
separated himself from the hunting party with the excuse of checking the
 area for possible dangers in the remote region where he'd led the 
unsuspecting royals. He had just launched his attack upon the family as 
Maenoth and Angston arrived. Angston told Maenoth to rescue as many 
royals as possible while Angston dealt with the traitorous wizard. 
Before it was over, the king was dead, his son, Philip and Queen Maria 
were badly injured, and Princess Melisé, who had immediately tried to 
save her brother with her own self defense skills, owed her life to 
Maenoth, who had personally shielded her from the worst of the wizard's 
deadly spells when he turned his ire to the princess. Several royal 
attendants were also killed. Angston drove off Tarsus, but at the cost 
of his own life.</p>
<p align="left">Once they returned to the chalet, Maenoth told the 
remaining nobles of what he and Angston had uncovered regarding the 
plot. Once the party was ready to travel, Maenoth guided them back to 
the capital in a funeral procession unlike one the country had ever 
seen.</p>
<p align="left">Soon, a semblance of order was restored. The queen 
recovered but, as a royal by marriage only, was ineligible to assume the
 throne. Prince Philip still lives, but he remains unconscious; no 
healing or curse-removing spell has any effect. So it is in this state 
that he was crowned king, with his sister, Melisé, named as his regent. 
The other plotters were captured and executed or fled and sentencing to 
exile, based on Maenoth's information. Maenoth never told Melisé of his 
feelings for her, concerned that she now has enough on her mind without 
worrying about "love."</p>
<p align="left">Since the traitor Tarsus was also head of the Royal 
Magery Academy, Melisé, the queen, and Maenoth became concerned that 
more wizards with treason on their minds might exist there. Maenoth, 
whose role in the dramatic rescue was downplayed both to help his 
continued anonymity and give the late Angston some of the accolades due 
him from a lifetime of service, volunteered to infiltrate the wizards' 
school.</p>
<p align="left">Maenoth, now without both his mentor and surrogate 
father and the woman he loves, entered the academy and has spent several
 years there. His progress has been slow, but he's now a respectable 
wizard in addition to his other skills. He's also spent much time 
working to uncover more traitors among the academy's faculty and 
students. He believes the time will come soon to act on this 
information, for the good of the country and for Melisé.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Maenoth</b></p>
<p align="left">Use Maenoth as an adventure starter in your campaign in one of several ways.</p>
<p align="left">As written, Maenoth possesses a wide range of skills, 
but he is not as powerful as a typical single-classed 16th-level 
adventurer. As a result, the Agent of the Crown may require the aid of 
more powerful, good-aligned heroes, such as the PCs, for help on some 
urgent mission for the regent.</p>
<p align="left">As a more neutral party (assuming his alignment didn't 
shift as a result of his time with Angston), Maenoth could be an amoral 
agent in the service of a monarch who doesn't care how Maenoth achieves 
his goals, just that he accomplishes the tasks he's given, regardless of
 the means or any collateral damage.</p>
<p align="left">As an outright villainous agent of an evil foreign 
power, the heroic PCs might be tasked with locating and eliminating an 
enemy agent that rumors say is present in the capital city or even in 
the royal court. This task could be the focus of a long-term campaign, 
using the various power levels of Maenoth as the PCs themselves advance 
in levels. Of course, the final battle with Maenoth should be when the 
16th-level version (powered up with several of his scrolls) is a deadly 
but not insurmountable challenge to the PCs.</p>
<p align="left">One final tidbit for DMs: Since Maenoth became a wizard,
 he could have summoned a familiar. Create one for him and add it to the
 campaign with Maenoth. If the familiar is a beautiful creature (such as
 a hawk) and is female, Maenoth may even name it Melisé.</p>
