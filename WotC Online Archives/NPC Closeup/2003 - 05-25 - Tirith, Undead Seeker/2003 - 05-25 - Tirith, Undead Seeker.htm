 and his brother, Kirith, were orphaned at a young age when a vampire 
settled in the mountain caves near their rural community. Over the next 
few months, the village suffered much under the undead's predation. 
Finally, a band of adventurers led by a priest of Heironeous came to aid
 the villagers. The priest organized the town's residents to prepare for
 the vampire's counterattack should the heroes' first attempt to slay it
 failed. The priest instructed the residents to gather in the most 
secure building in the village, and he helped them ward the doors and 
windows with holy symbols. He told the villagers to remain there during 
the hours of darkness until the heroes returned to tell them the terror 
that had menaced their lives for so long was defeated, and he also 
worked with them to come up with some viable defense plans should all 
their attempts to safeguard the church fail.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 heroes' first attack on the vampire did indeed fail, and the priest was
 correct that the undead horror would seek its revenge against the 
harmless farmers and merchants. The vampire bypassed the defenses by 
coming down the chimney in <i>gaseous form.</i> It attacked mercilessly, killing several of the villagers, including the boys' parents.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 heroes reached the site of the massacre as quickly as possible and, 
with the help of the remaining residents, destroyed the bloodsucker 
forever. The priest vowed to take Tirith, Kirith, and the other orphans 
back to his temple and raise them under the guiding hand and unwavering 
eye of Heironeous.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tirith
 grew to become both a fighter and a cleric of Heironeous, and he served
 his god as he adventured with a group of likeminded individuals. This 
changed, however, when the group ran into a hunting pack of wights. 
Tirith was the only survivor. Both his brother, Kirith, now a paladin of
 Heironeous, and Tirith's ladylove, Asmea, a half-elf bard, were among 
the dead. Having seen everyone closest to him struck down and slain by 
the undead, Tirith determined that he would spend the rest of his days 
destroying any undead he can find.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="2003%20-%2005-25%20-%20Tirith,%20Undead%20Seeker_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:15px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#CC0000;"><b>Tirith, the Avenger</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tirith
 eventually made his quest into a profitable, if incredibly dangerous, 
profession. Tirith, "the Avenger" became quite well known in the region 
in which he was raised and particularly the city that holds the temple 
where he grew up. Early in his career as a destroyer of undead, church 
elders grew pleased that the young man was doing so much good in the 
name of Heironeous, but one priest carried deep concerned over the 
dutiful, some say obsessed, warrior of light and life. Castellus is the 
priest who brought Tirith and his brother back to the temple as orphans,
 and while all the temple clerics and staff took hands in raising the 
boys right, they were always closest to Castellus, which was an 
arrangement that gave Castellus much joy and pride. He came to regard 
the boys as sons, and he was a fine father figure for the growing boys.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After
 Tirith started down the path of undead destruction, Castellus continued
 to seek Tirith's company on the young man's increasingly infrequent 
visits to the temple, but the young man could see only vengeance and 
hatred. Love, friendship, and the simple joys of life no longer held any
 pleasure for Tirith. He lived to kill all the undead he could find. 
Sometimes he allowed others to accompany him on his quests, but he most 
commonly worked alone; he didn't want the responsibility of others' 
lives weighing on his mind and distracting him from the hunt.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 single-mindedness so worried Castellus that he feared another blow to 
Tirith's psyche would lead to insanity. As a result, Castellus refrained
 from telling Tirith of recent news regarding the young warrior's rural 
home. Reports had reached the temple that a vampire (or vampires) again 
stalked the lush foothills where Tirith was born. Further, Castellus 
performed divinations that reveal that the vampire matched the 
description of Tirith's mother, thought slain by the original vampire 
those many years ago. Castellus, while too old to adventure, made 
inquiries in the region and confirmed that the body of Tirith's mother 
may not have been burned as Castellus instructed and that the grave 
where she was to have been buried was empty. Castellus instructed the 
temple clergy and staff that this information was to be withheld from 
Tirith until Castellus deemed it appropriate.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20030525a&amp;page=3"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tirith, Clr 4/Ftr 4</b></span></a></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="2003%20-%2005-25%20-%20Tirith,%20Undead%20Seeker_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Tirith, the Betrayed</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Knowledge
 of Tirith's ability to hunt and kill undead eventually spread 
throughout the nation. He has even worked for the royal household to 
eliminate threats to the nation (and the family's well-kept secrets). 
The acclaim has done nothing for the man, however. Still haunted by 
those he has lost to the seemingly never-ending threat posed by the 
undead, Tirith now wonders if his actions make any difference at all. 
There always seems to be more undead to destroy, no matter how many he 
returns to dust. He often wonders why he should go on. Is his life 
nothing but a delusion of his own self-importance? Is it possible that 
the undead have taken his reason to live from him, too?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To
 make matters even worse, Tirith learned recently that Castellus 
betrayed him. It was only after the elder cleric's death from a plague 
that recently ravaged the city that the other members of the church's 
hierarchy no longer felt bound by Castellus's instructions to keep 
certain information regarding the return of Tirith's mother to this 
world as a vampire. After Castellus was buried with great honor, for he 
saved many residents of the city from death by the plague even while he 
suffered from it himself, Tirith was given the details that Castellus 
had gathered since the first reports of vampiric activity in his 
homeland came in.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Since
 the elder priest last spoke with Tirith, Castellus had uncovered the 
following facts: A vampire is operating in Tirith's homeland; it claims 
to ask after "her" sons Tirith and the late Kirith; it resembles 
Tirith's mother at the time of her death; this vampire is creating spawn
 and gathering other undead to its lair deep in the mountains; all the 
priests and adventurers sent to investigate or probe the vampire's group
 for its overall strength have failed to return. It is this last fact 
that convinced the church's elders to let their vows to Castellus lapse 
with his death. They are afraid that the forces this vampire has already
 gathered may be too powerful to halt. So, they turned to the church's 
deadliest hunter of the undead to aid them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 his part, Tirith's psyche tore when he heard that his own mother has 
returned as a vampire that is creating more of the abominations. He is 
terribly unbalanced and not even he knows what to do. Can he "kill" the 
mother he longed to see again for so many years? Can the undead ever be 
wiped out? Should he continue to fight or give in to what increasingly 
seems the inevitable march of life into undeath?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Knowing
 only that he must go back to the home he knew as a boy, Tirith prepares
 to leave the city. The church elders now wonder if telling the valiant 
young man was the correct thing to do; they wonder if even he is capable
 of destroying the growing army of the undead that gathers in the 
mountains. Have they consigned their greatest warrior to certain death, 
or worse?</span></p>
