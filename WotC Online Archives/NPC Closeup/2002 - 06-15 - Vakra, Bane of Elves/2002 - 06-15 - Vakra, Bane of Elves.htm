<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2006-15%20-%20Vakra,%20Bane%20of%20Elves_files/cc_june_2002_med.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="264" width="203">Vakra, the Silent</b></p>
<p class="size2">Vakra grew up in the sewers of Pal Ador after being 
abandoned by his human mother, who was distraught with shame over her 
relationship with an elf. However, she knew that the mean streets of Pal
 Ador did not treat half-elves kindly. Despite this knowledge, she left 
him behind anyway as she left Pal Ador, and she hoped that the fates 
would do something to protect her child.</p>
<p class="size2">Vakra's salvation came from a band of humans who lived 
in the sewers. They found the newborn squalling among the filth and 
raised Vakra as one of their own. However, it was not a loving situation
 -- Vakra was raised to be tough and do anything to survive. His human 
family roamed the tunnels underneath the part of town most heavily 
inhabited by elves. Patrols of elven soldiers constantly swept the 
sewers, arresting or killing any person that they found. This harrowing 
experience taught the young half-elf the skills to survive and instilled
 in him a deep hatred for elves.</p>
<p class="size2">After a time, Vakra started keeping more and more to 
himself. Used to the quiet depths of the sewers, Vakra said little when 
his way of living was interrupted by others. What contact he had with 
his former human band was only to barter for supplies and trade 
information about elven patrols. To the sewer dwellers, Vakra simply 
became known as "the Silent One."</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020615b">Vakra, Rng2 (CR 2)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2006-15%20-%20Vakra,%20Bane%20of%20Elves_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Vakra, the Hunter</b></p>
<p class="size2">For years, Vakra wanted only to be left alone. He 
dodged constables and made forays to the surface to steal bits of food 
and equipment. That all changed, however, when he visited the sewer 
dweller stronghold. Vakra found it under a massive assault by elven 
warriors. He could do little but watch the slaughter of the closest 
thing he had to family. From that moment on, Vakra went from being the 
hunted to the hunter.</p>
<p class="size2">He began making raids against the guard posts, hunting 
down any elf that dared to venture down into the depths of the sewers. 
Once, he raided a large stockpile of weapons and magic items, taking 
some of them and burning the rest. This only angered the elves further 
and caused the number and size of the patrols to be doubled.</p>
<p class="size2">Both sides were taken off guard when a sudden 
infestation of carrion crawlers made traveling through the sewers very 
hazardous. Vakra fought a two-sided conflict and used his skills and 
knowledge of the tunnels to lure patrols into nests of the disgusting 
creatures.</p>
<p class="size2">During one of these ambushes, Vakra was moving 
stealthily through a tunnel close to the surface. He came upon a lone 
figure that was shrouded in darkness. Vakra drew his weapons and eyed 
the mysterious person warily, who introduced himself as Mezriss. Mezriss
 was a fellow half-elf, and he offered Vakra employment with his band of
 assassins, the Scars. Vakra accepted after Mezriss explained that his 
group would allow Vakra more access to the high-placed officials -- and 
the elves that he hated so much.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020615c">Vakra, Rng7 (CR 7)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2006-15%20-%20Vakra,%20Bane%20of%20Elves_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Vakra, the Bane of Elves</b></p>
<p class="size2">His vast knowledge of the sewers and tunnels beneath 
Pal Ador served Vakra and the Scars well over the years, allowing them 
almost complete access to all parts of the city. Vakra's burning hatred 
for elves turned him into an impersonal killing machine, and he 
dispatched his foes with practiced ease. The elves he hated placed an 
enormous bounty on Vakra, but few mercenaries were willing to enter into
 the sewers to hunt him down.</p>
<p class="size2">Vakra met his final match when Jesrug, the dwarf 
constable, was brought in to end the terror of the Scars. The dwarf 
proved a difficult target, because the dwarf used drastically different 
tactics than the elves that Vakra was accustomed to fighting, and the 
dwarf seemed very much at home in the cramped tunnels. Jesrug led 
several parties into the sewers to flush out the half-elf, and he almost
 succeeded in capturing Vakra.</p>
<p class="size2">Vakra was lured into Jesrug's trap at the docks, along 
with the rest of the Scars. Traveling with a small contingent of trained
 killers, Vakra emerged from the sewers and converged on the dwarf, who 
seemed to be alone and vulnerable. Suddenly dozens of soldiers, 
sorcerers, and wizards appeared out of nowhere. Almost all of the lesser
 members of the Scars were killed or captured. Vakra's escape route was 
blocked by protective magic, and he was captured by Jesrug's assistants.</p>
<p class="size2">Jesrug's men and women hauled Vakra off to the elven 
High Council of Pal Ador, who immediately decided that he was to be 
executed for his crimes. Vakra found himself locked in a high tower, 
where he now waits for his death at the hands of the people he hated 
with such passion.</p>
