<p align="left"><b>Namiid Softstrider, Tribal Hunter: </b>Namiid is an 
orphan, rescued and adopted by his tribe after orcs made a predawn raid 
on the frontier homestead where he was born. The orcs killed Namiid's 
entire family, but someone carried the infant Namiid away from the scene
 and hid him inside a hollow tree. Sometime after sunrise, a group of 
barbarian hunters came to investigate the column of smoke that marked 
the burning ruins of the homestead. They found nothing of monetary 
value, but they heard the hungry baby crying in the woods and sought him
 out. The hunters were initially confused (and somewhat frightened) by 
what they heard. The hollow tree distorted the baby's cries, making them
 seem unnatural, and the hunters could not see any source for the 
sounds. Several of the hunters were convinced they were dealing with a 
malevolent spirit, but their leader, an older man called Kijkaa, 
insisted on locating the source of the sound. It was Kijkaa who first 
discovered the baby inside the tree. Kijkaa named the child Akulay (one 
who looks skyward), because when the hunter looked inside the tree, he 
saw the baby staring up at him.</p>
<p align="left">Kijkaa and his wife, Lanninko, took in Akulay and raised
 him as their own son. Adopted children are fairly common in the tribe, 
and young Akulay fit in fairly well, even though he looked nothing like 
the other boys. Kijkaa's people are tall, long-legged, and light haired.
 Akulay was dark, squat, and bandy-legged. The boy received more than 
his share of teasing, but Kijkaa and Lanninko were wise and taught their
 son to ignore jeers and gibes from his detractors. Kijkaa, who was just
 about the best stalker in the tribe, also taught his son the art of 
moving quietly and remaining unseen.</p>
<p align="left">One night, shortly before he was to undergo the rites of
 manhood for his tribe, some other boys heated a small stone in a fire, 
then slipped it into one of Akulay's boots while he was bathing. 
According to tribal tales, Akulay jumped halfway to the moon when he 
donned his boots, but quickly sat down and dumped out the hot stone. 
Akulay took the pain and the embarrassment well, but he quickly 
determined who was responsible for the prank. (It wasn't difficult as 
the pranksters were laughing the hardest at Akulay's discomfort.) Akulay
 decided to get even. During their next hunting trip, Akulay waited 
until his group was returning home, laden with game, then put the skills
 his father had taught him to use. During the hunting party's last night
 on the trail, he slipped out of his bedroll and stole the pranksters' 
boots. He carefully hid the boots among the carcasses the group was 
carrying, and nobody found them until after everyone returned to the 
tribal camp. The pranksters were obliged to finish the trip barefoot, 
and they had plenty of blisters and thorns in their feet to show for it 
afterward.</p>
<p align="left">The tribal leaders commanded that the discord between 
Akulay and his rivals should stop when the boys reached manhood, but 
they gave Akulay the adult name of Namiid (star dancer) to commemorate 
the short feud. As an adult, Namiid uses his new name, but members of 
his family and tribe still call him Akulay when nobody from outside the 
tribe is present.</p>
<p align="left">As a young man, Namiid is fiercely dedicated to his 
tribe, but intensely curious about his natural parents and their kin. He
 has visited the ruins of his old homestead several times. Ostensibly he
 is merely hunting in the area, but he has combed the site for clues to 
his true identity several times. He has found nothing. The orcs and the 
years obliterated all traces.</p>

<p align="left"><b><img src="2004%20-%2001-24%20-%20Namiid%20Softstrider,%20Child%20of%20Two%20Cultures_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Aidian Softstrider, Adventurer: </b>After nearly a 
decade of surreptitious visits to his old family homestead, Namiid 
received a shock. Someone had rebuilt the place. The new landholders 
were distant cousins, but they didn't know what to make of this strange 
young man who just walked out of the wilderness and into their barnyard 
one autumn day. Namiid, too, was confused at first, and a little angry 
as well. He had come to think of the old homestead as his own, and he 
resented finding squatters on the place. Still, Namiid has been brought 
up with a sense of hospitality and brought offerings of game and other 
wild foods to the strangers.</p>
<p align="left">After Namiid explained what little he knew of his own 
past, his relatives supplied a few details. His natural parents, Namiid 
learned, had named him Aidian, after his paternal grandfather. He had 
two older siblings, brother and sister, who also apparently perished in 
the orc raid. When his cousins arrived to reclaim the homestead, they 
found a simple grave marked by four colored stones and a holy symbol of 
Pelor (the family's patron deity). The cousins assumed the whole family 
was buried there, but were delighted that "Aidian" had survived.</p>
<p align="left">Namiid stayed with his cousins through the winter. It 
was his cousins' first winter on the frontier, and Namiid's survival 
skills probably kept them alive. In the spring, Namiid bid his cousins 
farewell and journeyed to the town where his namesake had been buried. 
He stuck around to learn the ways of the civilized world, using the name
 his natural parents had given him, but keeping the name Softstrider (a 
nickname the tribe had given to him and his adopted father).</p>
<p align="left">Aidian soon fell in with a rough crowd. His martial 
prowess and stealth skills made him a natural recruit for a thieves' 
guild, and he served as a thug and journeyman thief for a few months 
before his natural good nature reasserted itself. Still the thieves had 
taught him to read and write, and they left him with no illusions about 
civilized life. </p>
<p align="left">Seeking to cleanse his spirit and reestablish his 
contact with the natural world, Aidian took up studies with the church 
of Ehlonna. Aidian believed the religious life provided him with a way 
to bridge the two worlds that gave him birth and brought him to manhood.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Aidian Namiid, Warden of the Frontier:</b> After a 
few years as an adventurer, Aidian became concerned about increasing 
tension between settlers moving into the frontier and his adopted 
people. Settlers were despoiling tribal lands and sacred sites, often 
through sheer ignorance. Members of his own tribe, on the other hand, 
were raiding the settlements, making themselves as big a nuisance as the
 orcs. Aidian foresaw an all-out war between the two groups, and he 
believed that would be a disaster no matter who eventually won the 
conflict. He expected that the orcs would snipe at both sides before the
 war and boost tension, increase their raiding during the confusion of 
an all-out war, and finally attack the weakened victor. </p>
<p align="left">He quickly set out to help mediate between his tribe and
 his natural people. He began using both his first names to show his 
ties to each side. The work was hard, but he eventually persuaded his 
tribe to stop their raids and help him hunt orcs.</p>
<p align="left">He successfully persuaded the settlers to respect tribal
 lands, mostly by showing how effective he and his tribe had been in 
stopping the orc raids. This allowed him to appeal to the settlers' 
sense of fair play and justice.</p>
<p align="left">Aidian's efforts at mediation have been successful so 
far. He now spends his days patrolling the frontier, keeping a sharp 
lookout for orc activity, and making sure that everyone else in the area
 respects each other's territory and customs.</p>
