<p class="size2">Above all other gamers, amidst collectors and costumed 
folk, there is no one more at home and familiar with the intricacies of 
attending gaming conventions as the conventioneer. For up to four days 
at a time (and sometimes conscious for all 96 unrelenting hours), the 
conventioneer rises above his or her game-playing peers to thrive in the
 chaotic environment that is a con.</p>
<p class="size2">Hard-core gamers, power gamers, die-hard gamers, and 
old-school gamers make extremely effective conventioneers. Casual 
gamers, newbies, and first-time gamers can greatly benefit from the 
experience that comes from taking up the dice bag of the conventioneer, 
though the rigorous gaming existence that is the stock and trade of a 
conventioneer can at first prove daunting</p>
<p class="size2">Conventioneers, not surprisingly, gather in great numbers at conventions such as <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/gencon/">Gen Con</a> and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/origins/">Origins</a>.
 However, some small cons (such as GeneriCon or MonteCon) see a 
disproportionate number of conventioneers in attendance, often well over
 50%. Amongst other gamers, conventioneers are often regarded with a 
sense of astonishment, as many of their savvy abilities lend them an 
almost unnatural aura (particularly if observed over the course of two 
or more days at a con.)</p>

<p class="size2"> To become a conventioneer, a gamer must fulfill all the following criteria:</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Knowledge (gaming system): </b>At least one rank in three gaming systems. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Feats: </b>Subsist on Junk Food, Appraise Swag.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> Must attend at least one convention (T-shirt purchase is optional).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Class Skills</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">The conventioneer's class skills (and the ability for 
each skill) are: Card Shuffling (Dex), Character Generation (Wis), 
Costuming (Cha), Dice Rolling (Dex), Gamer Humor (Wis), Knowledge (all 
skills taken individually) (Int), Read Polyhedral Dice (Int), Scarf 
Pizza (Con), Schmooze (all skills taken individually) (Cha), Solve 
Puzzle (Int), Spot Celebrity (Wis), and Tote Rulebooks (Str).</p>
<p class="size2">Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">All of the following are class features of the conventioneer prestige class.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Conventioneers 
gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor. Note that wearing armor can 
provide situational modifier bonuses to Costuming skill checks, 
especially if it's really cool armor. Carrying a weapon can provide 
similar benefits but can provoke ejection from most cons if it's ever 
unsheathed -- even if it's a really neat-o weapon.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Increased Gamer Knowledge: </b>For each level 
attained, the conventioneer adds one rank of skill in any of the 
following: Knowledge (anime), Knowledge (comic book), Knowledge (gaming 
system), Knowledge (movie), Knowledge (sci-fi/fantasy novel), Knowledge 
(television series), and Knowledge (video game).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Convention Savvy:</b> When you start putting 
conventions under your belt, they just keep getting easier. For each 
level attained, the conventioneer becomes even more worldly in the ways 
of the convention and may add one of the following specialties (no bit 
of convention savvy can be chosen more than once):</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Around-the-Clock Gaming</b>:<b></b>Cramming as much 
gaming as possible into a weekend is what it's all about. Conventioneers
 develop a phenomenal ability to play through the wee hours and well 
into the next day without flagging. Around-the-Clock Gaming gives the 
conventioneer +15 bonus to Will saves vs. sleep after less than 24 hours
 of continual gaming, a +10 bonus between 24 and 48 hours, and +5 bonus 
to all other saves vs. sleep. (<i>Note:</i> Gamers playing elven or half-elven characters are still susceptible to sleep.)</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Comprehend Schedule</b>: The intricate and arcane 
matrices of events in the pre-registration and on-site convention books 
become clear. A conventioneer with Comprehend Schedule gains a +6 bonus 
to Intelligence checks to understand the listings of events to such a 
high degree that well-formed plans can be made and successfully 
executed. Note that this bonus not only works when pre-registering for 
events with limited openings, but also allows for on-the-fly 
decision-making. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dealer Room Timing:</b> Conventioneers have an 
uncanny knack for getting in lines when they are at their shortest and 
most quick-moving. A conventioneer with Dealer Room Timing also manages 
to acquire hot, fast-selling, or highly desirable items and merchandise 
before they're all gone.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fill Open Chair:</b> When a player drops out of a 
game or doesn't show for a scheduled event, someone has to jump in. The 
conventioneer's talent for being in the right place at the right time 
enables him or her to join games that otherwise would have been missed. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Obscure Reference: </b>Conventioneers know things like which image in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 has shown up in all three editions. They can, at will, toss out 
buzzwords, catch phrases, and other jargon that instantly displays their
 seemingly infinite gaming knowledge. (Note that conventioneers often 
use Obscure References to speak with one another, adding +4 to Innuendo 
checks when communicating with other conventioneers.) Obscure Reference 
also adds +4 to Diplomacy checks when trying to impress game masters, 
and +2 to Intimidate checks when dealing with non-conventioneers.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Quote</b>:<b></b>Lines from movies like <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> and <i>Highlander</i>, or TV shows such as <i><b>Star Trek</b></i> or <i>The Simpsons</i>
 constitute the primary content of many gamer conversations. However, 
the conventioneer is even more intimately familiar with a well-chosen 
collection of favorites. For each point of Int modifier +6, the 
conventioneer possesses nigh-perfect recall of dialogue from one 
feature-length film or single season of a television series. An 
appropriate quote used in conversation or in response to another quote 
provides a +2 synergy bonus to Diplomacy or Perform checks made against 
that audience for 1d10+3 minutes.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Resist Stench:</b> After nonstop gaming in excess of
 24 hours, all gamers develop an extraordinary scent-based attack that 
worsens with time. (Those within 5 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save
 (DC 15) or be wracked with nausea, suffering a -2 circumstance penalty 
to their ability to pay attention to what's going on in the game for 
1d4+2 minutes.) Conventioneers instantly become acclimated to this 
odiferous olfactory offense and are immune to its effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Rules Lawyering</b>:<b></b>Cover-to-cover, 
front-to-back, a conventioneer learns everything there is to know in the
 rulebooks. By wringing out every drop of information regarding a 
favored gaming system, a conventioneer gains a +6 situational modifier 
to arguments about that system and has a +4 synergy bonus on Min/Max 
Character skill checks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Wilderness Lore (convention):</b> There are many 
impediments to successfully navigating an entire convention, and 
conventioneers know secrets that make the whole experience significantly
 easier and more pleasant. Conventioneers with Wilderness Lore 
(convention) receive a +6 bonus to all checks that deal with locating 
urgently needed restrooms, cheap food, and hotel rooms with friendly 
occupants and/or extra floor space. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Track Event:</b> Despite the best intentions on the 
part of organizers, scheduled events occasionally go missing. Whether 
they've changed locations, game master, theme or system, a conventioneer
 has a near unerring sense that guides the way to errant events.</p>
