<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2001-26%20-%20Zola,%20Sorcerer%20of%20the%20Scars_files/Zola_med.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="210" width="181">Zola
 is a sorcerer currently working for a band of assassins called the 
Scars. They are efficient, ruthless, and utterly mercenary, working for 
anyone that can put up the cash. Their base of operations is in the 
divided city of Pel Ador, a sprawling metropolis made up primarily of 
humans and elves. Not long ago the elves and humans were at war, until 
they somehow established a fragile peace. Despite this peace, the 
half-elves feel the wrath of both elves and humans, who automatically 
view them as suspect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Zola, the Scorned</b></p>
<p class="size2">While growing up, Zola felt the brunt of being a 
half-elf in a place where clear divisions were drawn between the races. 
Being a half-elf in Pel Ador meant that he was neither elf nor human. 
However, from an early age, Zola realized that he had the power to do 
amazing things. He used his magic and skills to stay alive in the 
violent back alleys and sewers of Pel Ador, doing his best to steer 
clear of fights he could not handle.</p>
<p class="size2">Zola did have one person he could depend on: a fellow 
half-elf named Mezriss. Mezriss introduced Zola to Sylic, the head of 
the local thieves guild named the Scars. Zola's abilities as a sorcerer 
were especially welcomed, and he did many small jobs eliminating easy 
foes or augmenting another hired killer as part of a team. Zola 
preferred to remain in the shadows, using his magic from a distance.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020126b">Zola, 2nd-level sorcerer (CR 2)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b>Zola, the Killer</b></p>
<p class="size2">Over time, Zola's ally, Mezriss, took control of the 
Scars and handpicked his lieutenants. Zola's abilities had increased by 
this time and the organization considered him an important asset. Zola 
continued to work as backup to other assassins, using his magic to 
soften up or gain ready access to a foe. He specialized in infiltration 
and subterfuge.</p>
<p class="size2">Zola's reputation increased, and many humans and elves 
sought after him to eliminate each other. By this time, Zola did not 
care who his employer was, as long as they had the gold (or magic) to 
pay his increasingly skillful services. As a gift for loyalty to the 
Scars, Mezriss gave Zola a <i>kukri of wounding</i>, which the evil sorcerer used many times during his missions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cc/cc20020126c">Zola, 6th-level sorcerer (CR 6)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p class="size2"><b>Zola, the Feared</b></p>
<p class="size2">Over the years, Zola became more of a myth, lurking in 
the shadows with his dark magic, dispatching his targets with practiced 
ease. By this time, both the humans and elves lived in fear of being 
singled out by the Scars, and the two races came together to eliminate 
what they considered to be a threat to both people.</p>
<p class="size2">The Pel Adoran nobility hired an outsider, a dwarven 
constable named Jesrug. They hoped that his status and neutrality would 
help in their fight against the Scars. Constable Jesrug showed amazing 
efficiency by arresting numerous lesser members of the Scars before 
turning his investigations toward the upper echelon of the assassin 
guild.</p>
<p class="size2">Zola was given the task to find the weaknesses of this 
dwarf, and he infiltrated into his house under the guise of a humble 
servant. For months, Zola observed Jesrug, feeding back information to 
Mezriss and the other members of the Scars, hoping to find a moment when
 they could catch the dwarf unaware.</p>
<p class="size2">The Scars picked a moment when Jesrug was alone along 
the misty docks of Pel Ador. Several key members of the Scars, including
 Zola, cornered the dwarf and made their move. However, the constable 
proved wilier than they expected, and the city guard soon surrounded the
 Scars. The organization had fallen victim to a sting orchestrated by 
Jesrug. A massive battle ensued and every member of the Scars fought for
 themselves. Zola did his best to get away, but was ultimately defeated 
and imprisoned by Jesrug's men. Sitting in the fetid dungeons of the 
city prison, Zola fumed at his bad luck while waiting for his execution.</p>
<p class="size2">A day before he was to be beheaded in the main square, a
 team of Scar rogues and assassins broke the sorcerer out of prison. 
Zola is currently laying low among several Scar safe houses, waiting for
 the right time to return to his nefarious trade.</p>
