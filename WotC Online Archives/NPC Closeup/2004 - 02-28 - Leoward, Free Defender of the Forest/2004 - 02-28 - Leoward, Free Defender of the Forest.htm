<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2002-28%20-%20Leoward,%20Free%20Defender%20of%20the%20Forest_files/cc_20040228a_med_vbb3ds.jpg" border="1" align="right" height="220" width="184">Leoward, the Simple Druid:</b>
 Even in his early years, Leoward felt that humans, more than the other 
races, were compelled to tell stories -- about anything -- and truth be 
told, they never shut up about the most trivial things. He also grew up 
thinking that humans never close their mouths and that they babble 
incessantly about the time some event happened or even what they did 
before breakfast. They tell these seemingly insignificant tales to 
anyone who will listen.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Leoward grew tired of the near constant social 
interaction with his fellow villagers and, when his father died (his 
mother having died during his birth), he set out on his own seeking 
nothing more than solitude.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The trade he learned from his father was woodworking. 
After a week in the woods, he realized that he would do better by living
 among the trees, yet he wanted to remain close enough to town that he 
could get supplies. He used what his father taught him to earn the 
supplies he needed, and he took dead wood from the forest and sculpted 
the material into anything he could sell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Leoward spent many years in the forest learning how to 
find the best wood that had fallen from trees or was otherwise dead. 
Such became his affinity for the woods that he began to feel at one with
 it. Slowly, with time and interaction with a traveling druid who would 
pass through the area once every several months to check on other areas 
of import, Leoward's affinity blossomed into abilities and he became a 
full-fledged druid.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20040228a&amp;page=2">Leoward, the Simple Druid (Druid 1) </a></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2002-28%20-%20Leoward,%20Free%20Defender%20of%20the%20Forest_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Leoward, the Hunter: </b>Leoward's tenure as a druid 
was uneventful for many seasons. He had long since learned how to 
survive in the woods entirely, but on occasion he would venture to the 
town for things he couldn't find in the woods or for things he had no 
desire to make on his own, such as clothing. </p>
<p align="LEFT">He tried to keep his visits in town to a minimum but 
despite -- or because -- of that, he gained a reputation as the "town 
druid" who was, of course, crazy. No one sought him out, but whenever he
 visited, the event would make the rounds of the gossips in town. Aside 
from this, no one thought much of his presence.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ricben Fiedlerson, a merchant who had close ties with 
shipping in a not-too-distant coastal town, was lured to the town 
because of rumors of a healing elixir made from a rare plant found only 
in the area. He made plans to gather as much of the plants as possible 
for profit. They were hard to find, but Ricben had a plan to make 
finding them easier: harvest the vast tracks of rich forest around the 
town, keeping the tall trees from obscuring the view of the 
low-to-the-ground plants, sell the wood to shipyards near the coast, 
find the rare plants and harvest them, then sell the remaining land to a
 mining concern. Ricben had pulled off an offensive environmental 
trifecta.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ricben paid no heed to stories of the town's druid, who 
would surely object to the planned use of the land. The local shipyards 
had an insatiable appetite for trees, and Ricben didn't have the luxury 
to compromise on supply or time to wait for planted trees to grow thick 
enough. He had those plants to find and minerals to be unearthed 
besides.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When Leoward heard the first day's trees go down, he was
 alarmed. When he discovered the source was a pack of humans cutting 
down swaths of trees on purpose, he became enraged. Almost without 
thinking, he wild shaped into a bear, frightened the loggers away, and 
destroyed one of their wagons.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Over the next few months, there were more episodes like 
that. Each day, Leoward spent more and more time in wild shape while 
hunting humans and defending his forest. Eventually, his rage grew -- 
and focused -- until he became something he'd never thought he would 
become: an efficient warrior who would preserve the forest at all costs.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20040228a&amp;page=3">Leoward, the Hunter (Druid 6/Nature's Warrior 1) </a></b></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2002-28%20-%20Leoward,%20Free%20Defender%20of%20the%20Forest_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Leoward, Free Guardian of the Forest:</b> Leoward's 
one-man battle against Ricben escalated. Ricben sent minions into the 
woods to find and kill the druid -- with depressing results. Bigger 
parties with more sophisticated weapons, including spellcasters, were 
also introduced into the forest with the sole purpose of killing Leoward
 by any means they saw fit. The rewards grew and with them came 
Leoward's proficiency as a guerilla fighter. He would shape into a 
stealthy animal and track the hunting party back to their camp whereupon
 he would sabotage everything he could before shaping into a swift 
animal and getting away.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Although he could have amassed a small fortune in wands,
 weapons, and other magic items from the people he killed and chased 
off, he left the items behind on a strange principle that his only 
concern was the forest, not acquiring items. Besides which, the wide 
variety of animals he could shape into coupled with the spells he could 
cast allowed him to accomplish most any goal he set for himself without 
having to use items. Desiring to be known as a protector of the forest 
and not a bandit, he left behind all the equipment from those foes he 
faced down in the forest. He kept the meager possessions he started out 
with, and he accepted new ones only from the traveling druid friend he'd
 known for years. Also, in the back of his mind was the fear that 
someone would plant an enticing magic item hoping he would take it, then
 use magic to locate the object and thereby reveal his location. 
Although he has grown a bit paranoid, his wary and not a little 
overcautious attitude toward magic has kept him alive and free.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Leoward's skill as a druid has also kept him from being discovered. Using spells such as <i>tree stride,</i>
 he can retreat to any point in the forest, far from any danger. The 
only thing that attracts Leoward is a hunting party camp or a group of 
clear cutters. Attempts to lure him out of the forest to a camp to 
ambush him have been foiled by underestimation of his abilities and the 
lengths to which he would go to undermine the hunters' and clear 
cutters' efforts. Much to their dismay, Leoward has shown himself 
willing to sacrifice trees from the forest to keep his effort going. 
He's a shrewd fighter with a cause -- the kind of man with which you 
can't negotiate.</p>
