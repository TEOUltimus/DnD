<p align="LEFT"><b><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><img src="2003%20-%2004-25%20-%20G%27ragh,%20Mongrelfolk%20Paladin%20of%20Heironeous_files/CC_Gragh_large.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="348" width="219"><span style=" color:#CC0000;">G'ragh, Repentant Warrior of the Mongrelfolk</span></span></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">G'ragh
 was raised in the warrior tradition of his tribe. The warriors of the 
Fleabiter Clan would routinely raid other mongrelfolk clans for 
livestock or property, or they did so just to test their bravery. These 
other clans eventually withered under the repeated assault of the 
stronger Fleabiter clan until they either were incorporated into the 
tribe or became extinct. As their resources dwindled, the Fleabiters 
fell into decline until a new source of sustenance arrived. A colony of 
humans arrived in the mountains and settled there, unaware of their 
neighbors. The Fleabiter Clan rejoiced in this new source of honor and 
food. They gathered a war party and struck. The first forays into the 
human settlements left the humans with a few less sheep and chickens and
 a few more bruises. As the attacks continued, the humans became more 
strident in their responses. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 young mongrelfolk warrior named G'ragh excelled in these raids, 
primarily because he enjoyed the challenge and the feeling of 
superiority over the humans that victory provided. Once the attacks 
became more serious and deadly, however, G'ragh began to resist the 
bloodthirsty tendencies of the rest of his clan.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Since
 they could not stop the attacks on their own, the humans called for 
assistance from outside their community. The answer to their plea 
arrived in the person of Moneth Falstyr, Holy Paladin of Heironeous. As 
he rode into town upon his dark brown charger, the wan sunlight 
reflecting off of his armor, the people were awed by the sight. After 
hearing their tale, the paladin offered to mediate between the two 
communities. Given that the mongrelfolk community was there long before 
the humans, but that the human community did not intrude on their 
territory, he felt that some kind of agreement might be reached. Moneth 
agreed to represent the humans and sent a request to the clan leaders to
 parlay.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 clan leaders accepted the request, but they had an entirely different 
agenda for the negotiation. They planned to lure the human into a trap 
and kill him, then attack the main community again. When G'ragh heard 
these plans, something within his soul rebelled at the idea. His 
concerns met with ridicule from his clan, and his elders commanded him 
to join in the ambush as punishment.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At
 the appointed time, G'ragh gathered with the other warriors out of 
sight of the place where the paladin and the elders of the Fleabiter 
Clan were to meet. The stars on the moonless night reflected their glory
 in the holy warrior's armor as he walked his horse to the meeting 
place, where the clan leaders awaited.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Just
 prior to the appointed signal, G'ragh jumped out of his hiding place 
and warned the paladin of the trap. Seeing that the ambush had failed, 
the mongrelfolk forces simply attacked en masse. G'ragh, Moneth, and 
Moneth's warhorse stood together against the onrushing horde and held 
their ground. After the battle, the battered trio watched as the 
remainder of their ambushers fled. Moneth placed his hands upon G'ragh's
 head and named him his squire, in the service of Heironeous.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" color:#CC0000;">G'ragh, Squire to Holy Paladin Moneth Falstyr of Heironeous</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For
 years G'ragh followed Moneth and expanded his horizons and his talents.
 Although the oddly matched paid drew some odd glances, Moneth's 
presence lent G'ragh an air of respect. Also, wearing the tunic of a 
squire of Heironeous didn't hurt at all.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">G'ragh
 proved himself time and time again in service to Moneth. He also 
learned to read and write, and he studied the teachings of the Church of
 Heironeous with the fervor of a committed soul. Moneth insisted that 
G'ragh have proper fighter training but did not want him to commit to 
the path of the paladin until he was sure it was what he wanted, for few
 understand the paladin's calling of service to others.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Indeed,
 G'ragh learned firsthand that there is more to being a paladin than 
wearing fancy armor and swinging a sword. He and Moneth got covered in 
mud while helping to shore up the banks of a flooding river and covered 
in dirt while helping to plow fields for an impoverished family. Through
 it all, they served the faithful of Heironeous in whatever ways they 
could.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" color:#CC0000;">G'ragh, Holy Paladin of Heironeous</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eventually,
 Moneth decided that G'ragh's faith had stood the test, and it was time 
to present him to the high priest of Heironeous as a new paladin in the 
god's service. In a ceremony befitting an honored knight, G'ragh was 
pronounced a Holy Paladin of Heironeous. As the high priest stated 
during the ceremony, "Heironeous is pleased with all those who stand for
 justice, be they human or not. We are pleased to call you Brother."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">G'ragh
 continues to wander the lands, this time in the armor of a Holy Paladin
 of Heironeous. He looks forward to any opportunity to serve. However, 
now that he does not have the stalwart Moneth at his side to lend him 
legitimacy in strange towns, G'ragh has wisely acquired a <i>hat of disguise</i> that enables him to pass as human among strangers.</span></p>
