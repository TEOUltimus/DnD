 monks of the Iron Rose were no strangers to abandoned children. A 
number of unwanted babies were abandoned at, or near, their gates every 
year. It seemed that the populace used the monasteries as a drop point 
for unwanted children rather than practicing temperance. Most of these 
babies were placed with families in the nearby village. Some were sent 
farther away to find homes. Thus, the discovery of an infant girl in the
 woods near the monastery's rear gates would not cause any stir or 
excitement. The master of the monastery saw something different in one 
girl, though -- something about her eyes. He decided to keep her where 
she could be monitored and guided. She was named Akiko, the autumn 
child, for she was found in autumn as the first snows of winter 
threatened.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Akiko
 was placed with a trusted family in the village and raised there until 
she was five years old. Upon her fifth birthday, she was taken into the 
monastery to live and train and learn there. The solitude and discipline
 of the monastery appealed strongly to young Akiko, and she thrived. The
 exposure to the cold after her birth did something to her brain, and 
she was not the smartest of the students. What she lacked in 
intelligence she made up for in determination and common sense, and she 
did not fall behind any of the students in either mental or physical 
lessons. When she became a young woman of 17, she assumed the mantle of a
 teacher at the monastery.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then
 the dreams began. In the dreams, she was a strong t'ien lung dragon. 
Her golden scales glistened in the sun as she flew, and her multicolored
 mane framed her head magnificently. Sometimes she delivered messages 
for the celestial bureaucracy, and other times she led flights of lesser
 dragons and breathed fire and destruction on those who deserved it. 
Sometimes she simply flew and enjoyed the sky. Each of the dreams 
stirred in her a compulsion to seek out something, though she was never 
sure what.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Her
 masters at the monastery were prepared for her dreams, but surprised at
 their nature. They thought she had something of the shadows about her, 
not of the great dragons. She was advised to heed the call and seek out 
her heritage, for that surely is what beckoned in her dreams.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Not
 quite believing she was descended from the great celestial dragons, 
Akiko nonetheless set out from the monastery to find the meaning of the 
dreams. She wandered the land for several years on this quest, seeing 
much of the world. Soon after she started out, she discovered an 
awakening magic potential within her, and she spent some time developing
 her powers as a sorcerer. She never lost the discipline that was bred 
into her in the monastery and she found a more rigid and orderly way of 
using her magic. Her magic also developed along lines that reinforced 
her combat training in the monastery.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">During
 all this time, the dreams continued. The further she grew into her 
magical powers, the more urgent the dreams seemed to her and the more 
they called. She recognized the calling and learned to use the 
half-awake time between sleeping and waking to meditate on the dreams 
and learn from them. In this way she came to see that she was being 
called to adopt the mantle of the celestial dragons somehow, and so she 
became a dragon disciple.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Akiko's
 progression as a dragon disciple has been slow because she was slow to 
believe that she really descended from the dragons. Life in the 
monastery emphasized the ordinariness of life and the experiences of 
common people. Magic was touched on, but never taught, and dragons were 
myths more than reality. She continued to develop her powers as a 
sorcerer, and from time to time she has made a leap of faith that 
allowed her to achieve more power as a dragon disciple.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 changed when she realized the power of magical flight. Upon her first 
casting of this spell, she soared into the air and felt the freedom that
 dragons feel. She was suddenly no longer tied to the ground and somehow
 spiritually no longer tied to her old way of life. She would never lose
 the discipline and outlook of a monk, but this new freedom brought a 
modification of that outlook.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Then
 it appeared. Golden scales glistening in the sun, sinuous body snaking 
its way down from the clouds, multicolored mane flowing in the wind, the
 t'ien lung dragon circled toward her. Her spell ended, but the dragon 
caught her with a strong wind and lifted her to meet itself.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"I
 am that from which you come," it told her, "and though you shall never 
become what I am, you have some of my nature within you. It has taken me
 some time to find you in this foreign land, though I knew that you had 
achieved power and understanding enough to comprehend what you are. From
 this time forward, you shall devote yourself to your draconic heritage,
 and in time we shall speak again."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Akiko
 felt herself lowered to the ground, and the great creature flew back 
into the clouds. During the whole time it spoke, and indeed the whole 
time it remained before her eyes, Akiko could not speak. The t'ien lung 
was too awe-inspiring to comprehend at first, and by the time she had 
gathered her courage it was gone.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Akiko
 now travels the world learning everything she can about dragons and 
about herself. She thought she knew herself very well, since she had 
meditated a great many times on her own nature. But she has only begun 
to see who she really is.</span></p>
