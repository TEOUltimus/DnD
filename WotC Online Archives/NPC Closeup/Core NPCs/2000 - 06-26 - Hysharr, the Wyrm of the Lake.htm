 Hysharr is a young green dragon on the verge of attaining adulthood. He
 dwells at the bottom of a large lake, where for the past several years 
his exhalations have been slowly poisoning the water. Dead fish have 
begun to wash up on the shores, and animals that drink from the lake 
become ill, and sometimes die. The general location of his lair can be 
detected by the sickly greenish tinge on the surface directly over it. 
Even so, he is at the very bottom of the lake, just over 150 feet deep, 
and reaching him -- and his store of treasure -- is no easy task.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hysharr: </b>Green dragon young adult; CR 10; Large

23, Dex 10, Con 19, Int 14, Wis 15, Cha 14.</p>

<p class="size2"><i>Special Attacks:</i> Breath Weapon. Hysharr can 
breathe a 40-foot cone of corrosive (acid) gas every 1d4 rounds; damage 
10d6, Ref save halves (DC 22).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Special Qualities:</i> Frightful Presence: Hysharr 
unsettles foes with his mere presence whenever he attacks, charges, or 
flies overhead. Creatures with 17 or fewer Hit Dice (excluding other 
dragons) within 150 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC 20) to avoid 
this <i>fear</i> effect. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD 
become panicked for 4d6 rounds. Those with 5 or more HD become shaken 
for 4d6 rounds. On a success, the creature is immune to Hysharr's <i>fear</i> effect for one day.</p>
<p class="size2">Water Breathing: Hysharr can breathe underwater 
indefinitely and can freely use his breath weapon, spells, and other 
abilities while submerged.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i> 1350 gp, 230 pp, eye agate (10 gp),
 golden yellow topaz (500 gp), jade (100 gp), fire opal pendant on gold 
chain (1400 gp), solid gold idol (700 gp), silver chalice with lapis 
lazuli gems (105 gp), chain shirt (100 gp), masterwork halberd, two 
thunderstones, treasure map, <i>+2 large steel shield</i>, <i>ring of swimming</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Spells Known (6/5):</i> 0 -- <i>daze</i>, <i>mage hand</i>, <i>open/close</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>read magic</i>; 1st -- <i>alarm</i>, <i>obscuring mist</i>, <i>identify</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>A Treasure-Hungry Dragon</b></i></p>
<p class="size2">In another three years, Hysharr will be a century old, 
and it eats at him that he has not amassed as much treasure as he feels a
 dragon should have. This concern has made Hysharr more sensitive to the
 fact that adventurers often carry items of great value -- or at least 
know where to find some. When Hysharr encounters anyone, his first 
priority is to relieve them of their equipment, treasure, and magic 
items. Victims with nothing -- and no prospects -- are still good for a 
quick meal.</p>
<p class="size2">Hysharr is so obsessed with collecting treasure that he
 bargains with adventurers he encounters: their treasure, or their 
lives. Hysharr's hope is that adventurers who surrender their treasure 
might come back later for revenge -- carrying more treasure.</p>
<p class="size2">But Hysharr also realizes that he is not powerful 
enough to defeat every party of adventurers that passes by. For such 
emergencies, Hysharr is also prepared to bargain for his own life. He 
offers his treasure map (which can lead to any location the Dungeon 
Master desires), knowing that if the adventurers pursue the treasure, he
 can follow behind them when he has recovered, and take from them 
whatever loot they are carrying away -- probably after they have 
expended most of their energy capturing it.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hysharr's Magic</b></p>
<p class="size2">As a young adult, Hysharr has become adept at 
manipulating magical energies, although he realizes that he still has a 
great deal to learn. For the time being, Hysharr uses spells to make his
 life easier. He uses <i>mage hand</i> and <i>open/close</i> to 
manipulate small objects that would ordinarily be beyond his ability to 
handle without breaking -- such as the smaller items in his treasure 
trove, or scroll tubes and wands he takes from foes.</p>
<p class="size2">Hysharr protects his lair by casting <i>alarm</i> on a 
half-submerged tree stump just off the shore of the lake, near a 
particularly prominent beach. In his experience, most adventurers who 
come to the lake use the area as a campsite or as a staging ground for 
expeditions under the water. (Groups come periodically to investigate 
dead fish and sickened cattle and wildlife in the area, victims of the 
lake's caustic tenant.) Anyone wading more than 10 feet out into the 
lake activates the mental <i>alarm</i>, alerting Hysharr to the 
possibility of intruders. The dragon then uses his keen senses to 
determine if someone is approaching his lair, or merely poking about on 
the surface.</p>
<p class="size2">If Hysharr ever has to leave the lake, he casts <i>obscuring mist</i>
 and rises slowly out of the water, trusting his blindsight to apprise 
him of danger. Similarly, just before reentering the lake, Hysharr casts
 <i>obscuring mist</i>, then crawls into the water and sinks slowly into the depths.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>The Dragon in Battle</b></p>
<p class="size2">Hysharr is not a particularly powerful dragon, and he knows it. </p>
<p class="size2">To compensate, he uses magic and his breath weapon, as well as the lake and the air, to overcome foes.</p>
<p class="size2">Having recently begun to explore magic, Hysharr is 
keenly aware that magic can make its wielders far more powerful than 
they appear, and he has learned to recognize spellcasters by their lack 
of armor and tendency to seek cover in the center of groups of fighters 
and similar "heavyweights." Against such opponents, Hysharr first tries 
his breath weapon, hopefully incapacitating any sorcerers or wizards in 
the group. If he becomes aware of a rogue trying to sneak up on him, 
Hysharr uses his <i>daze</i> spell to keep that particular foe off-balance until Hysharr can deal with him more directly.</p>
<p class="size2">When Hysharr is forced into close combat, however, he 
employs his breath weapon as often as possible, hoping to scatter his 
foes apart and leave them vulnerable (or allow him to get away). In 
melee, Hysharr uses his Snatch feat to attack first armored 
spellcasters, then more physical combatants (fighters, paladins, rogues,
 and the like).</p>
<p class="size2">Once Hysharr has a firm grip on his target he retreats 
at top speed, heading either for the lake or into the sky. He prefers to
 carry his victims under the water, where he can watch them slowly 
drown. (Note that most player character races are too big for a Large 
dragon to continue inflicting damage upon them through use of the Snatch
 feat.)</p>
<p class="size2">He's also learned from past experience that friends of 
his victims often leap into the water in an attempt to rescue their 
companions, usually arriving just after the poor wretch has drowned, 
been torn to pieces, or succumbed to Hysharr's corrosive breath -- and 
just in time to suffer the same attack.</p>
<p class="size2">If a foe under the water is still giving Hysharr 
trouble, Hysharr often simply releases the figure. Those who aren't 
dragged down by the weight of their equipment find themselves targets of
 the dragon's next grapple attempt before they can draw another breath.</p>
<p class="size2">When foes have exhibited an ability to breathe 
underwater, Hysharr carries them high into the sky, beyond the reach of 
their comrades' ranged weapons, then drops them. He tries to ensure that
 they land a good distance away from the rest of their party, so that 
even if they survive the fall, his victims cannot immediately rejoin the
 fight. If a foe Hysharr has carried into the air is being difficult, 
the dragon uses his breath weapon to take some of the fight out of the 
character.</p>
<p class="size2">Finally, although Hysharr has learned to make the most 
of these tactics, he occasionally forgets them entirely faced with an 
elf or pixie, whose races are among his favorite foods. Whenever Hysharr
 encounters either one, he focuses his attacks on that creature, if 
possible. If he ever succeeds with a Snatch, he breaks off the combat to
 carry his victim back to his watery lair, where he devours the unlucky 
morsel at his leisure.</p>
