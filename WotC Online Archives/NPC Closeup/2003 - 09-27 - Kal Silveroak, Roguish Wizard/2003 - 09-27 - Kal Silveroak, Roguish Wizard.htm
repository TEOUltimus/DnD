 birthname is Kaldelwyr Liameil. Like many elf adventurers, he 
translated his family name into Common, and he shortened his first name,
 as well. He finds that he can get along much more easily as just plain 
"Kal" than he can as Kaldelwyr, which validates his suspicions that his 
full name sounds a bit pretentious to non-elves. His familiar, a black 
and white rat named Moondance, accompanies him wherever he goes.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Though
 devoted to his magical studies, Kal hardly matches most people's ideas 
about how a wizard looks and acts. He has an athletic body and he moves 
with a dancer's grace. His bright smile and sparkling blue eyes can make
 farm girls and serving wenches weak in the knees. He also has a quick 
wit and an easy manner that tends to put people at ease. Kal's good 
looks and social graces come to him naturally, however, and magic 
commands most of his attention and efforts. Never particularly adept at 
archery or swordplay, Kal always preferred to tackle his problems with 
his mind, and magic seemed the best way to nurture his inborn talents 
and to achieve some measure of success and respect in the elven 
community. Though elves aren't very status conscious as a rule, every 
society has an elite circle and Kal's family ranks pretty low on the 
social ladder. They have a reputation for eccentricity that manifests 
itself in various ways. Several of Kal's ancestors died in spectacular 
(and messy) incidents while adventuring. Others have made their fortunes
 through less than savory means -- Kal's winning ways run in the family,
 and these traits have produced a long string of charlatans and con 
artists. Finally, Kal's family tree contains several half-elf branches, 
and most of those are derived from Kal's more infamous ancestors. Though
 not exactly an outcast among elves, Kal usually feels more at ease 
among strangers than among his fellow elves.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 wanderlust that strikes many elves Kal's age has hit him hard. He 
travels the land, visiting far-flung wizard conclaves where he can pick 
up new spells and get familiar with new modes of magical study. Between 
these visits, he often falls in with groups of adventurers and seeks 
opportunities to test his arcane abilities in new ways (not to mention 
pick up wealth and valuable experience). Kal also has decided to look up
 his relatives whenever he can. All in all, Kal is a busy guy. 
Fortunately, he's an elf, so he doesn't need to sleep much.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="2003%20-%2009-27%20-%20Kal%20Silveroak,%20Roguish%20Wizard_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Kal Silverheels, Thrill Seeker:</b>
 Years of travel have brought a change of outlook for Kal, especially 
after he met a few of his more notorious cousins. Always open-minded, 
Kal found many things to admire about the black sheep in his family, 
especially after he joined them on a long adventure -- nothing 
dishonest, just good, rousing, and profitable exploration of some lost 
ruins. During this venture, Kal and his cousins found themselves pitted 
against a group of rivals who tried a variety of dirty tricks, 
culminating in a nasty ambush in which Kal's group deftly turned the 
tables of their foes. Afterward, Kal couldn't help liking his cousins; 
he found them to be adaptable, droll, and vivacious.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Kal
 promptly joined his cousins on a month-long spree of high living, 
during which the group spent all the profits from their victory. Newly 
destitute, Kal soon learned to live by the seat of his pants (with 
expert tutelage from a pair of fetching and larcenous kissing cousins). 
Kal found there was more than one way to put his mind to work. He finds 
that the way of the rogue tests his mind in ways that magic never could.
 He remains as charming as ever, but there's a hard edge to his soul 
that allows little room for true gallantry or honor (though Kal has 
learned to fake both reasonably well). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Kal
 maintains his wandering lifestyle, but spends most of his time seeking 
danger for excitement and profit. He has largely set aside his magical 
studies in favor of more "practical" subjects, such as stealth, forgery,
 legerdemain, and the foibles of the mortal mind. He loves to pose has a
 bright-eyed young elf fighter while keeping his magical and roguish 
talents hidden. He still keeps Moondancer close by, but usually keeps 
him hidden. Moondancer has proven a valuable ally in many capers. The 
rat can squeeze into tight places and has proven quite a capable sneak 
thief in his own right.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Kal Silveroak, Troubleshooter: </b>After
 years of hair-raising adventures and close calls, Kal began to rethink 
his life as an itinerant rapscallion and con artist. A chance meeting 
with a wizard who was once a colleague reminded him of how much he 
enjoyed studying magic, and when he helped his old friend get out of a 
tricky jam, he discovered the joys of doing a good deed.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Kal
 returned to his first love -- magic -- and thoroughly enjoyed himself 
for a short time. It wasn't long, however, before the old wanderlust 
stuck him once again. He was briefly torn between his two vocations, but
 his resourcefulness soon asserted itself, and he found of path of study
 that allowed him to follow both his interests.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Kal
 hasn't given up entirely on confidence games and swindles. One of his 
cousins once told him: "You can't con an honest being," and Kal has 
discovered the adage is true. He loves nothing better than separating 
petty tyrants, dishonest merchants, and corrupt officials from their 
ill-gotten gains. He still enjoys playing the role of the callow elf. 
Sometimes he poses as a wizard (concealing his roguish talents) and 
sometimes he plays the eager rogue (concealing his magical powers). 
Either way, Kal can keep foes guessing about what he can accomplish and 
what he might try next.</span></p>
