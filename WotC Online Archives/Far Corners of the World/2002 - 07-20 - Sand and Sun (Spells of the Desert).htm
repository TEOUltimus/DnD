<p class="size2">Welcome to the first installment of the Far Corners of 
the World series of articles! Each article explores unusual and rare 
spells, monsters, and magic items related to the distant and often 
inhospitable reaches of any campaign world. These spells, monsters, and 
items are presented in a world-neutral format so that you can adapt them
 easily to your own campaign world, where they can be discovered as 
rewards and punishments for a party of adventurers who choose to travel 
far from their homes in search of adventure. This article presents four 
such spells for use in any campaign, although their strengths can be 
realized truly only by those who understand the mysterious ways of the 
desert. </p>
<p class="size2"><img src="2002%20-%2007-20%20-%20Sand%20and%20Sun%20%28Spells%20of%20the%20Desert%29_files/fw_july_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="181" width="184">The
 desert is a beautiful place -- a beautiful place and a dangerous place.
 Civilization rarely penetrates far into the sandy and stony depths of 
the desert, for there is little to sustain it in the barren reaches. 
Nevertheless, many call the desert home and both love and respect its 
power. Nomadic tribes ply the trackless reaches, navigating by the sun 
and stars and camping at established oases. Criminals often live in 
exile in the desert, eking out a living and waiting for a chance to 
return home once society has forgotten their crimes. Druids live there 
as well; these solemn individuals possess a knack for finding life and 
comfort among the dunes and protectors, and they serve their chosen 
environs as diligently as those who live in less inhospitable climes.</p>
<p class="size2">Many of these denizens of the desert turn to magic to 
make their lives easier. A number of these spellcasters have developed 
unique spells tied to the sands and sun of the desert. Some have 
discovered ways to call up the wind and heat of the desert to leach the 
life from their enemies or to knock them prone with exhaustion. Others 
have developed ways to imprison their enemies below the sandy dunes for 
later interrogation. And others have gone even further by developing 
methods to become a living extension of their chosen home.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Blood Sirocco</b></span><br> Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> Cone<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Blood sirocco</i> creates a hot, stifling wind that 
tears across the landscape, kicking up clouds of dust and sand and 
moving in the direction you are facing. The force of the <i>blood sirocco</i>
 automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected 
flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance 
wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish these lights. Creatures caught
 in the area of this severe wind may be affected (see <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>
 for details about severe wind effects on creatures). Any creature is 
entitled a saving throw each round to ignore the effects of the <i>blood sirocco</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">Those who fail to save against the stifling winds of a <i>blood sirocco</i> quickly become dehydrated (see page 86 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>)
 as the supernatural winds blow through their bodies, carrying away tiny
 streamers of blood and moisture and carrying it on the wind as a fine 
mist. Each round an affected creature remains in the area of effect and 
fails a Fortitude saving throw, this leaching of blood causes 1d6 points
 of damage and 1 point of temporary Strength damage. Additionally, a 
creature that suffers damage from a <i>blood sirocco</i> is dazed and 
can take no actions for 1 round. He can defend himself from attack. 
(Undead and constructs are not subject to any of these dehydration 
effects.)</p>
<p class="size2">If cast in an already dry region, such as in a desert, the <i>blood sirocco's</i> duration increases by a number of rounds equal to the caster's Wisdom bonus.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Dune Tomb</b></span><br>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> Up to one creature/level within 60 feet of each other who are in contact with the same sand dune<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 day/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">This spell can affect only creatures who are in contact
 with a sand dune that is at least twice as large as the largest 
creature targeted. You can target up to one creature per level, but all 
of the targets must be within 60 feet of each other. All targeted 
creatures who fail to resist the <i>dune tomb</i> effect sink down into the dune to a depth equal to twice their height and are magically <i>held</i>
 for as long as the spell persists. During this time, they do not need 
to eat, drink, or breathe, and they do not heal damage (to hit points or
 to ability scores), but they do continue to age normally. Each day that
 passes after the initial casting, a victim must make another Will save 
or suffer 1 point of permanent Wisdom drain as their mind slowly begins 
to fall apart under the strain of the inky isolation.</p>
<p class="size2">As long as the spell remains in effect, the caster can 
communicate to any of the entrapped victims in a manner identical to 
that provided by the <i>sending</i> spell, save that there is no limit 
to the number of words that can be transmitted. Communicating in this 
manner requires concentration, and it removes the need for the victim to
 make a Will save to prevent Wisdom drain until another 24 hours pass 
after the communication ends. The victims can reply as they wish, but 
the caster can always opt to end the conversation as a free action, 
plunging the victim back into isolation. The caster can release any or 
all of the victims at will by dismissing the magic entrapping the victim
 in question. A mental ping informs you if the victim leaves the tomb.</p>
<p class="size2">The <i>freedom</i> spell can free the imprisoned 
person, but only if it's cast within 60 feet of where the person is 
entombed. Magical search by a <i>crystal ball</i>, a <i>locate object</i> spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is entombed, but <i>discern location</i> does.</p>
<p class="size2">Desert spellcasters often use this spell to entrap enemies, promising them freedom in return for information.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Material Component</i>: A hollow gold 1-inch square 
box containing sand and a mummified body part from any genie. The gold 
box must be worth at least 2,000 gp.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Heatstroke</b></span><br>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One living creature<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You cause the targeted creature to suffer as if it had 
been toiling for hours on end under the merciless hammer of the desert 
sun. If the target fails to resist the spell, it immediately becomes 
fatigued. If the target is already fatigued, it instead becomes 
exhausted. The target suffers 2d6 points of subdual damage from the 
oppressive heat as well, even if he or she makes the Fortitude saving 
throw to avoid fatigue or exhaustion.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Sandform</b></span><br>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 4<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute/level</p>
<p class="size2">When you cast this spell, your body, along with all 
equipment worn or carried, transforms into living sand. You take the 
form of an ooze, and you are immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, 
stunning, and polymorphing, for the duration of the spell. You can still
 be affected by mind-affecting spells since, unlike oozes, you still 
possess a mind and retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 
scores. You are not subject to critical hits or flanking. You become 
blind, but gain the blindsight special quality, which allows you to 
sense vibrations and subtle changes in the air around you, granting you 
"vision" of a sort to a range of 60 feet. </p>
<p class="size2">You also retain your base attack bonus, base saves, 
alignment, level, class, type (and subtype), extraordinary abilities, 
spells, and spell-like abilities, but not your supernatural abilities. 
You can cast spells for which you have components. The new form can be 
disorienting. Any time you are in a demanding situation (such as 
combat), you must succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or suffer a -2 penalty 
on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks until the 
situation passes. Upon death, you revert to your original form.</p>
<p class="size2">Your new form makes you difficult to kill, and, as a 
result, you gain a number of bonus hit points equal to your size, as 
detailed on the following table.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="200"><tbody><tr><td><b>Your Size</b></td>

<p class="size2">While in sand form, you have a speed of 20 feet. You 
can pass through openings as small as a quarter of an inch in diameter, 
although passing through an opening two size categories smaller than you
 takes a full round action. You also gain a natural attack: an abrasive 
slam with a gritty pseudopod that grants 5 additional feet of reach. The
 number of times you can attack with this pseudopod each round is 
determined by your base attack, and you apply 1.5 times your Strength 
bonus on any damage done as if you were attacking with a two-handed 
weapon. A successful hit does a base of 1d8 points of slashing and 
bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p class="size2">In sandy deserts or on sandy beaches, you gain a +10 
circumstance bonus on all Hide checks and one-quarter concealment 
(attacks against you suffer a 10% miss chance). This natural attack form
 is the only natural attack form you can use while in this state.</p>
