<p class="size2">It is known by many names: the Night Below, Deepearth, 
the Underdark. An extensive, almost limitless region of caverns, 
tunnels, and lightless subterranean waterways, the Underdark has long 
been a tantalizing and dangerous realm to explore, if only for the 
wealth of strange and powerful magic to be found therein. Adventurers 
who return from forays into the depths below bring with them tales of 
strange monsters, alien landscapes, and potent magic. Many of these 
tales have since become well known to the dwellers of the surface world.
 The cruel and powerful drow, the inscrutable mind flayers, and the 
surprisingly benevolent svirfneblin have become fairly well known after 
numerous explorations into the tunnels. But the reaches of the Underdark
 are vast, and there are even more dangerous surprises awaiting 
discovery in the deepest trenches of the Night Below. These are depths 
into which even the drow fear to go -- depths that some say even the 
mind flayers have not fully explored.</p>
<p class="size2">Nonetheless, the bravest explorers can make amazing 
discoveries in these lightless trenches. There are stories of deserted 
underground cities, their walls covered with strange runes of forgotten 
magic; an intrepid traveler could learn much from the runes upon these 
walls. More likely, though, adventurers run afoul of these spells only 
when they are used against them by the dwellers in the hidden depths. 
Some of these spells manipulate the senses of the target, making it more
 or less difficult to navigate the lightless tunnels. One is rumored to 
grant control over the mindless oozes that lurk in the depths. Others 
take control of the stone itself, either by rapidly shaping deadly 
stalagmites or by infusing it with fell, sickening energy. The most 
bizarre of these spells is perhaps the <i>deepsong</i>, a spell that allows the caster to gain greater knowledge of her surroundings.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Deepsong</b></span><br>Divination<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 7<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Area:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">All that occurs in the depths of the Underdark is 
witnessed by the stone. Over the ages, an infinite legion of events has 
come to pass, and in their passing they have left their mark upon the 
stones of the Underdark. The <i>stone tell</i> spell allows you to "tap 
into" this resonance of events to a limited extent, but this bonding is 
only a scratching of the surface of the strange phenomenon known to a 
few as the <i>deepsong</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">With this spell, you can attune your mind so you can experience the <i>deepsong</i>. The <i>deepsong</i>
 can be seen, felt, heard, and tasted, and it even makes itself known in
 more mystical ways to the subject of this spell. If you are above 
ground, the <i>deepsong</i> is muted and difficult to hear, and you 
quickly become oppressed and despondent, suffering a -4 morale penalty 
on all checks and attack rolls.</p>
<p class="size2">While underground, however, you are filled with a sense of belonging and welcome as the susurrus of the <i>deepsong</i>
 envelops you. This grants a +2 morale bonus on all skill checks and 
attack rolls. While underground, you can also speak with the stones, 
which relate to you who or what has touched them as well as revealing 
what is covered or concealed behind or under them. The stones relate 
complete descriptions if asked. You can also gain knowledge of up to 
three facts from among the following subjects: the general layout of 
caverns and tunnels, plants and fungi, minerals, bodies of water, 
people, general animal population, presence of elemental creatures, and 
the presence of powerful abominations and undead. Note that a stone's 
perspective, perception, and knowledge may prevent the stone from 
providing the details you are looking for (as determined by the DM). You
 can speak with natural or worked stone. </p>
<p class="size2"><i>Focus</i>: A 5-pound lump of stone harvested from a 
depth of at least two miles below ground and that has never been exposed
 to the light of the sun, moon, or stars.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Oozepuppet</b></span><br>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> One ooze<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 day/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You telekinetically take control of the targeted ooze, 
manipulating it and forcing it to move and attack as you see fit. You 
can force the ooze to perform as you desire, within the limits of its 
abilities. Controlling the ooze's actions for an entire round is a 
move-equivalent action for you. When not directed to move, attack, or 
undertake any actions by you, the telekinetic forces hold the ooze 
immobile. The ooze has no mind, but its base instincts still cause it to
 resist this telekinetic control. If you force the ooze to take a 
self-destructive action, the ooze gains a new Fortitude saving throw to 
negate the effects of the spell. Once control is established, you must 
have line of sight to the ooze to manipulate it, but distance is not 
otherwise a factor, unless you and the ooze are on different planes (at 
which point the spell ends). You can manipulate the ooze while <i>scrying</i> upon it, for example.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Remove Scent</b></span><br>Illusion (Glamer)<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 1, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 1<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Area:</b> Creature touched<br><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless, object)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless, object)</p>
<p class="size2">The creature or object touched has all trace of an 
olfactory presence removed for the duration of the spell. The scent 
ability cannot detect a creature under the effects of a <i>remove scent</i>
 spell. It also negates the harmful side effects of the noxious stench 
exuded by certain creatures, such as ghasts, for the duration of the 
spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Material Components</i>: A pinch of unscented candle wax.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Sudden Stalagmite</b></span><br>Conjuration (Creation)<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 4<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One creature<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex half<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">A razor sharp stalagmite bursts forth from the ground 
to impale the targeted creature. Although the target gains a Reflex save
 to halve the damage done, the stalagmite itself is nonmagic and is not 
subject to spell resistance. Airborne creatures within 10 feet of the 
ground gain a +4 bonus on this save, and creatures higher than this 
cannot be harmed by this spell. The stalagmite is about 1 foot wide at 
its base and up to 10 feet tall. If it encounters a ceiling before it 
reaches full size, it stops growing.</p>
<p class="size2">The sudden growth of the stalagmite does 1d6 points of 
piercing damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In addition, a target 
that fails to make a saving throw against this spell and takes damage 
from it is impaled on the stalagmite and cannot move from its current 
location until it makes an Escape Artist check (DC 15). The stalagmite 
can be removed in other ways, as well, such as with a <i>stone shape</i>
 spell. The victim can even break free with a successful Strength check 
(DC 25), although this deals an additional 3d6 points of slashing damage
 on the victim. The damage caused by this spell is nonmagical, but it 
penetrates damage reduction as if it were a +1 weapon.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Transmute Rock to Sickstone</b></span><br>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Clr 8, Drd 7, Sor/Wiz 8<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> One Large size boulder, or one 5-foot-square section of stone, or one stone creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">In the deepest reaches of the trenches of the 
Underdark, the very stones are said to be imbued with a fell energy. 
These stones glow with an unhealthy color that does not exist on the 
surface world, and any who tread too near these stones sicken and die 
over the course of several days. This material is known as <i>sickstone</i>,
 and this spell imbues normal stone with these deadly properties and 
then magnifies these properties even further so the debilitative effects
 occur almost instantly.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Sickstone</i> glows with a nauseating 
not-quite-green, not-quite-silver light that provides illumination to a 
radius of 40 feet. Any creature in range of this illumination must make a
 Fortitude saving throw each round or take 1d6 points of temporary 
Constitution damage. Only 1 point of temporary Constitution damage is 
taken if the saving throw is successful. Anyone who actually physically 
contacts the <i>sickstone</i> takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw, 
and any Constitution damage taken as a result becomes permanent 
Constitution drain. The damage caused by <i>sickstone</i> is caused by a magical disease, so creatures that are immune to magical diseases are immune to the effects of <i>sickstone</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">Some particularly cruel wizards have been known to 
grant stone minions like golems, elementals, or shield guardians the 
ability to transform themselves into <i>sickstone</i>. A stone creature under the effects of a <i>sickstone</i>
 spell does 1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain to anything it 
strikes, unless the target makes a Fortitude save against this spell, in
 which case only 1 point of permanent Constitution drain is dealt.</p>
<p class="size2">Once the spell expires, the affected stone becomes 
chalky and powdery. Its hardness is permanently cut in half (round 
fractions down) as a result. A stone creature with damage reduction has 
its damage reduction score lessened by 5/+1, as well. Stone lessened to a
 hardness of 0 or stone that gets lessened to a -1 in either part of the
 damage reduction score crumbles to dust. For example, if a stone 
creature originally has a damage reduction score of 5/+1, it gets 
lessened to 0/0 when the spell expires. If the creature had 10/silver as
 its damage reduction score, it changes to 5/-1 (silver), which means 
that it crumbles to dust.</p>
