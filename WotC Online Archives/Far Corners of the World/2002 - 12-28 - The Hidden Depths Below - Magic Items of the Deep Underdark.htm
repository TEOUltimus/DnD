<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="590">
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p class="size2">The denizens of the Underdark are, as a whole, quite 
adept with the ways of magic. Even the least experienced drow or 
svirfneblen or duergar can use some form of magic, for example. Combined
 with the hostile nature of the environment, it should come as no 
surprise that a large number of magic items exist in the deep caverns 
below. The search for such unique and powerful items is perhaps the 
primary attraction the Underdark holds for surface explorers and 
adventurers. Presented here is a sampling of several items that have 
been created by the various races of the Underdark. In most cases, time 
has shrouded the source of these items, but they remain useful and much 
sought after commodities nonetheless.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Boots of the Xorn:</b> The dark grey, thick leather <i>boots of the xorn</i>
 allow the user to pass through stone and earth as a xorn, which slides 
through the ground as easily as a fish swims through water. Your passage
 through stone leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and it does not create 
any ripple or other signs of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell 
cast on an area containing someone burrowing with these boots flings the
 wearer back 20 feet, stunning the wearer for 1 round unless it makes a 
Fortitude save against the spell.</p>
<p class="size2">The boots grant a burrowing speed of 20 feet. 
Activating the boots is a standard action, but they function for only 10
 rounds once activated, and they can be activated only three times a 
day.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 10th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>meld into stone</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 48,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Circlet of Self:</b> For some reason, many denizens of the Underdark have potent mind-affecting powers. The <i>mind blast</i> of the illithids, the enslave power of the aboleth, and the confusing gaze of the umber hulk are excellent examples. The first <i>circlets of self</i> were invented to grant resistance to these attacks.</p>
<p class="size2">When worn, <i>a circlet of self</i> grants a +4 
resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting attacks. If
 the wearer of the circlet makes a saving throw against a mind-affecting
 attack, he can choose as a free action to absorb the portion of the 
effect that would have normally affected his mind. Once a mind-affecting
 attack has been absorbed in this manner, it automatically protects the 
wearer from the next attack of an identical nature. This causes the 
absorbed energy in the circlet to vanish. The wearer cannot absorb a 
mind-affecting attack if one is already absorbed by the circlet, and the
 wearer cannot voluntarily purge an absorbed attack from the circlet. 
After protecting the wearer from such attacks 50 times, the circlet 
crumbles to dust.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 12th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, Iron Will, <i>resistance</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 40,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Faceless Mask: </b>A <i>faceless mask</i> looks like
 a shallow oval stone bowl with the inverted impression of a face on the
 inner surface. When held against the face of any creature, the mask 
adheres to the creature's face and bonds with it, erasing the creature's
 facial features (eyes, nose, ears, and mouth) completely. Removing a <i>faceless mask</i> is a full-round action that causes great pain (and 2d6 points of subdual damage).</p>
<p class="size2">Although the faceless mask robs the wearer of the 
ability to hear, see, smell, and taste, and prevents the use of any bite
 attacks, the benefits granted by the mask outweigh these disadvantages.
 The wearer is immune to all attacks that require sight, hearing, or a 
sense of smell (such as gaze attacks, most language-dependent spells, 
sonic attacks, a harpy's captivating song, darkness, and a ghast's 
nauseating stench). In addition, the wearer of the mask gains the 
blindsight ability to a range of 50 feet. Blindsight allows the target 
to maneuver and fight as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility and 
darkness are irrelevant to the creature, though blindsight does not 
allow the creature to notice ethereal beings. The creature does not need
 to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its 
blindsight ability.</p>
<p class="size2">Finally, as long as the mask is worn, the wearer is sustained without food, water, and air.</p>
<p class="size2">A faceless mask uses the eye lens/goggle magic item slot when worn.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>alter self, blindsight, create food and water, water breathing</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 74,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Ring of Stone Mastery:</b> The plain marble <i>ring of stone mastery</i>
 grants its wearer command and mastery over the stony tunnels of the 
Underdark. It functions properly only as long as the wearer is 
surrounded by stone, although the stone may be worked or unworked. When 
worn on the surface, the ring becomes horribly heavy, reducing the 
possessor's speed to one-half of normal.</p>
<p class="size2">While worn, the <i>ring of stone mastery</i> grants the
 stonecunning ability possessed by dwarves. If worn by a dwarf, the 
bonus from the ring and the racial bonus from being a dwarf stack. The 
ring also thickens and hardens the wearer's skin to a stone-like pallor 
and texture, granting a +3 natural armor bonus.</p>
<p class="size2">The ring of stone mastery also allows the wearer to use the following three powers once a day each: <i>spike stones</i>, <i>stone tell</i>, and <i>sudden stalactite</i>.</p>
<p class="size2">Also once per day, the wearer of a <i>ring of stone mastery</i> can summon a Huge earth elemental to do his bidding, as if by the <i>summon nature's ally VII</i> spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 13th; <i>Prerequisites:</i><i>spike stones, stone tell, sudden stalactite</i>, <i>summon nature's ally VI,</i> Forge Ring; <i>Market Price: </i>138,500 gp.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sickstone:</b> Sickstone isn't actually a magic 
item. Rather, it is a rare form of magic stone that exists in the 
deepest reaches of the Underdark. Some believe that sickstone occurs 
naturally, while others believe the stuff is a remnant from an ancient 
civilization that wielded terrible magic on the rocks to bring them to 
their will. In any case, large portions of the deep caverns are shot 
through with sickstone deposits, making a dangerous region even worse.</p>
<p class="size2">Sickstone is easily distinguished from normal 
surrounding rock and stone, since it glows with an unhealthy 
silvery-green glow. This glow provides illumination to a radius of 40 
feet from the edge of the field of sickstone. Living creatures within 
this illumination are quickly seized with dizziness, nausea, and a 
lurking feeling of dread and oppression as the magical energies in the 
stone slowly start to leach out their life forces. Upon first entering 
the illumination area, a living creature must make a Fortitude saving 
throw (DC 13) or suffer 1d2 points of temporary Constitution damage. 
This saving throw must be repeated every hour the creature remains 
exposed to sickstone aura. Creatures that are immune to disease are 
immune to the debilitating effects of sickstone.</p>
<p class="size2">Small amounts of sickstone (in isolated amounts of less
 than 50 pounds) do not inflict sickness in their area of illumination, 
but a living creature who comes in physical contact with any amount of 
sickstone must make the Fortitude save above to avoid suffering 1d2 
points of temporary Constitution damage. Sickstone can be embedded into 
any bludgeoning weapon so that any living creature struck by the weapon 
must make the Fortitude save to avoid sickness. Note that the weapon's 
wielder must also save. Weapons made with fragments of sickstone cost an
 additional 2,000 gp to create.</p>
<p class="size2">Despite the amount of exposure, a creature is affected by sickstone only once per hour.</p>
<p class="size2">Apart from its glow and sickening aura, sickstone 
should be treated as normal stone, with the exception that natural 
sunlight causes it to crumble to chalky, inert powder in a matter of 
seconds if it fails a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15). Exposing a large 
vein of underground sickstone to sunlight via spells like <i>sunbeam</i> can cause a localized collapse if the sickstone fails to resist the attack.</p>
<p class="size2">The spell <i>transmute rock to sickstone</i> creates a 
field of powerful sickstone with a much stronger aura. This same 
technique is what gives the sickstone golem its enhanced aura as well. 
Raw sickstone is still dangerous, and many have been lured to its glow 
only to be slain by its emanations.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sour (Magic Armor Special Ability)</b>: The sour 
magic armor special ability cannot be applied to shields. Sour armor 
exudes a horribly bitter taste that is quite unpleasant to all 
creatures. If a living creature makes a successful bite attack against 
someone wearing sour armor, the creature must make a Fortitude saving 
throw (DC 14) or become nauseated for 1 round. If a living creature 
successfully swallows a target wearing sour armor, the creature 
automatically takes the next round to spit up the swallowed target (a 
full-round action) and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 14) or 
become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Sour armor provides no additional 
protection from damage caused by being bitten or swallowed, but it may 
cause creatures to avoid using such attacks against the target in the 
future.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th; <i>Prerequisites: </i>Craft Magical Arms and Armor, <i>stinking cloud</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> +1 bonus.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sundisc:</b> Surface travelers who found that certain denizens of the depths below could be combated with sunlight originally created <i>sundiscs</i>. A <i>sundisc</i> appears as a 6-inch diameter golden disc depicting a carving of the rising sun. Upon command, a <i>sundisc</i>
 glows with sunlight and provides illumination in a 60-foot radius. 
Creatures who suffer penalties in bright light suffer them while exposed
 to this magical light. If the <i>sundisc</i> is placed inside of or under a lightproof covering, the effect is blocked until the covering is removed. If a <i>sundisc</i>
 is brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa), the two 
effects temporarily negate each other so that the otherwise prevailing 
light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. Once 
activated, the <i>sundisc</i> glows for 3 hours. Once this period expires, the <i>sundisc</i> crumbles to dust.</p>
<p class="size2">A glowing <i>sundisc</i> can be thrown as a grenadelike weapon (range increment of 10 feet). Upon impact, it detonates into a <i>sunburst</i> (as the spell). The <i>sundisc</i> is destroyed in this detonation.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 18th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>daylight, sunbeam, sunburst</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 19,800 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 3 lbs.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Violet Rod:</b> A <i>violet rod</i> is a gnarly, 
dull purple-grey rod covered with vibrant purple nodules and tendrils. 
Those who have encountered violet fungi before can recognize the rod as a
 petrified violet fungus tendril. A <i>violet rod</i> can function as a <i>rod of withering</i>, so attacks with it are made as with a <i>+1 light mace </i>that
 deals no hit point damage. Instead, the wielder deals 1d4 points of 
temporary Strength damage and 1d4 points of temporary Constitution 
damage to any creature touched with the rod (by making a melee touch 
attack). If the wielder scores a critical hit, the damage from that hit 
becomes permanent ability drain. The defender negates the effect with a 
Fortitude save (DC 14). Against plants, the <i>violet rod</i> does double the normal ability damage on a hit.</p>
<p class="size2">Three times a day, with the proper command word, the rod radiates an <i>antiplant shell</i> in a 10-foot radius, although this shell affects only fungi and not regular plants. Fungus creatures from the <i>Monster Manual</i> and the <i>Monster Manual II</i>
 affected by this antifungus shell include myconids, phantom fungi, 
shriekers, violet fungi, and the pale flenser from the previous article.
 Creatures composed of otherworldly fungus (such as the rukarazyll from 
the <i>Monster Manual II</i>) are not considered true plants, and as 
such are unaffected by this shell. Dangerous fungi such as yellow and 
brown mold are not forced back by the shell, but they are rendered inert
 and harmless as long as they are within the radius of the shell.</p>
<p class="size2">Finally, once a day you can <i>command fungi</i> (as <i>command plants</i>, but limited to fungi) by holding the <i>violet rod</i> aloft and verbally commanding the fungi to do your bidding.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 15th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Rod, <i>antiplant shell, command plants, poison</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 71,000 gp.</p>
