 the far corners of the world, extremes of terrain are the rule. Vast 
burning deserts, trackless insect-filled swamps, frozen wastelands, and 
desolate volcanic peaks present dangers of their own. As a result, lost 
cities located in these remote areas are often seen as shelters from the
 dangers of the environment by explorers. Unfortunately, the monsters of
 the region often have the same reaction, and worse, strange creatures 
that have survived prior ages (or perhaps were even spawned in the 
cataclysm that left the lost city abandoned) lurk in the ruins.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>The creature clambers face-first down the ruined 
wall, a small buckler strapped to one arm and a crooked wooden club 
clutched in a hand. Its legs and arms are unusually long, and its feet 
look similar to its hands, yet don't quite have opposable thumbs. It 
looks vaguely like a bald, tailless monkey with large ears and eyes, and
 its wide mouth is filled with tangled sharp teeth.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Often when civilizations collapse, a fraction of the 
populace remains behind. Usually members of the lower class that others 
simply forgot or ignored find themselves reduced to the roles of 
scavengers in the ages to come. As the years turn to centuries, they 
grow more and more feral. The exact results of this regression can vary 
from civilization to civilization; the unhappy creature known as the 
brood monkey is an example of what might become of a civilization of 
highly religious humans that falls into decline.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A brood monkey, while once human, decreased in size and 
in mental faculties over many generations. Yet each one has retained its
 fierce loyalty to the priests and gods during its decline. However, 
while the desires and goals of brood monkeys may have narrowed over this
 time, their focus on achieving these goals only strengthened. Brood 
monkeys have no name for their own race; they can barely grasp the 
concept of society. Their skill at using crude tools, their frightening 
alacrity, and their faith are their greatest assets, and these factors 
alone often prove enough to grant them the tenacity to keep fairly large
 territories in many lost cities.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some brood monkeys communicate among themselves with a 
crude language that consists of a few words of Common augmented with 
hoots, hollers, and wild gesticulations. Their leaders can often recite 
long and complex prayers to their ancient deities (in Common), yet few 
of them can grasp the actual meaning of the words, having learned them 
phonetically from their elders at a young age.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Brood monkeys prefer to fight with clubs, since these 
weapons are plentiful and easy to use. Nevertheless, a brood monkey 
isn't above using other weapons it can scavenge; they are proficient in 
all simple melee weapons. In combat, a brood monkey attacks with a 
shocking burst of flailing weaponry and savage bites. In larger groups, 
one or two of them typically hang back to support the others with their 
spell-like abilities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Flurry of Blows (Ex):</b> A brood monkey can flail 
wildly with any simple melee weapon or unarmed attack as a full attack 
action. This grants the brood monkey an additional attack with his melee
 weapon, but all melee weapon attacks suffer a -2 penalty as a result. 
This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of 
opportunity the brood monkey might make before its next action. A brood 
monkey with at least 5 Hit Dice becomes more adept with his flurry of 
blows attack, and the penalty for using it drops to -1. A brood monkey 
with at least 9 Hit Dice has no penalty at all to his flurry of blows 
attacks. A brood monkey may attack with his bite as a secondary weapon 
in a round he performs a flurry of blows -- any penalties from his 
flurry of blows do not apply to his bite attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>cure minor wounds</i>, <i>doom</i> (DC 12); 1/day -- <i>cause fear</i> (DC 12), <i>cure light wounds</i>, <i>shield of faith</i>. Caster level 2.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Immune to Enchantment (Ex):</b> The brood monkey's 
fantastic faith and focus grant it complete immunity to all spells and 
spell-like effects of the school of enchantment. This extends to 
supernatural attacks and effects that duplicate spells of these schools,
 such as a vampire's domination gaze.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> A brood monkey has a +8 racial bonus on 
Climb checks and can choose to take 10 on a Climb check even when rushed
 or threatened. A brood monkey's natural agility gives it a +4 racial 
bonus on Balance, Jump, and Tumble checks.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>A strange, shimmering sheet of vapor rises out of the
 ground -- a shapeless cloud of what could be steam or fog were it not 
for the burning eyes that lurk deep in the creature's core. Four 
tendrils of mist extrude from the nearest facing of the creature, 
questing hungrily for prey.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">With the passage of countless ages, the majority of any 
guardians and sentinels that survived the ancient cataclysm long since 
died or moved to different regions. Yet one category of creature in 
particular remained at their posts: constructs. The golems and other 
animated guardians created by the ancients simply remained at their 
posts, patient and silent, awaiting new orders that would never come. 
Eventually, the elements wore down even these ancient constructs, and 
their bodies fell apart from disuse.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Yet so strong was the binding magic that anchored the 
animating elemental spirits to these ancient golems that when the bodies
 died, their elemental "souls" died as well -- yet they did not return 
to the elemental planes once their bodies wasted away. Still bound to a 
body that no longer existed, these disembodied elemental spirits 
transformed into strange undead known today as golem remnants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A golem remnant is a particularly unusual undead 
creature. The elemental spirits that create them are no longer bound to 
the Material Plane, yet their ages of idle torment that ended with 
dissolution universally leave them insane, and once freed, they seek out
 other statues, suits of armor, even dead bodies to inhabit and animate.
 With each new "body," their original programming becomes more and more 
corrupted, and the eventual fate of all golem remnants is to become a 
nearly-mindless killer locked into a ruined city by a purely 
psychological cage of insanity. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A golem remnant prefers to spend its time within a solid
 object, and it uses this "body" to attack mindlessly. Once its body is 
destroyed, the remnant momentarily cannot inhabit a new body, and until 
it refocuses its animating energies, it lashes out at anything living 
with tendrils of vapor that infuse the mind with visions of madness and 
anguish. Golem remnants modify their melee attacks with their Dexterity 
modifier rather than their Strength modifier.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Possess Object (Su):</b> As a standard action, a 
golem remnant can move into a square occupied by any Large or Huge 
object. This object immediately animates as an animated object (see <i>Monster Manual,</i>
 page 13). Damage done to the animated object is not transferred to the 
golem remnant. While animated, the object's natural attacks gain the 
benefit of the golem remnant's touch of madness (see below). The object 
does not gain the benefit of the golem remant's fast healing, but if a 
golem remnant is damaged before it possesses an object, its fast healing
 continues to work on its own hit point total, so that when it is 
eventually forced out of the animated object it has likely healed most 
or all of the damage it may have already suffered. The possessed object 
does gain the benefit of the golem remnant's spell resistance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A golem remnant can be forced to vacate its possessed body in one of two ways. Successfully targeting a possessed object with <i>dispel chaos</i> or <i>dispel evil</i>
 forces the golem remnant to vacate the object if it penetrates the 
creature's spell resistance and it fails a Will save (use the golem 
remnant's Will save, not the animated object's Will save). A golem 
remnant is also driven out of its possessed object if the animated 
object is destroyed. Once a golem remnant is driven out of a body, its 
animating powers are momentarily drained. It must wait for 1d4 rounds 
before using the power again.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Touch of Madness (Su):</b> The golem remant's touch 
inflicts 1d6 points of Wisdom damage, or 2d6 points of Wisdom damage on a
 successful critical hit. While the golem remnant is possessing an 
object, the animated object's natural attacks deal this additional 
Wisdom damage as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Madness (Ex):</b> A golem remnant uses its Charisma modifier to adjust its Will saving throw rather than its Wisdom modifier.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This six-legged pale red lizardlike beast is the size
 of a small building. Its hook-shaped face resembles a beak, and tiny 
red, intelligent eyes peek out from under a spiny brow. Its neck is 
short and powerful, with a pair of massive bat wings and six limber legs
 with seven-toed talons. The creature's tail is surprisingly long and 
prehensile, ending in a whiplike lash.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">These massive dragons seem drawn to lost cities, and 
they often make their lairs within. A ruin wyrm's territory can span 
several city blocks, often in excess of a mile radius, so only the 
largest of ruined cities can support more than one of these monsters 
without one killing the other over some perceived incursion. Ruin wyrms 
have little interest in creatures smaller than Large size, and they 
often dwell in relative peace with large tribes of humanoids who live in
 the ruins as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Much speculation as to the source of the ruin wyrm has 
bandied about explorers' circles, universities, and museums. Many 
believe that the ruin wyrm seems drawn to ruined cities simply to gather
 together what loot it can from the abandoned vaults and treasuries, and
 the size of the average ruin wyrm hoard definitely speaks in support of
 these claims. Yet others believe that the ruin wyrms represent some 
sort of ancient guardians of these ancient cities; certainly they seem 
to have little interest in the cruelty exhibited by many other dragons.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adventurers often seek out ruin wyrms as allies. A ruin 
wyrm made helpful with Diplomacy (normally, ruin wyrms are unfriendly 
toward adventurers) or other means usually lets the adventurers take 
shelter in its territory, providing a safe place to rest on extended 
forays into the lost city. For the right price (usually the same price 
it would cost to have a spellcaster cast the spells in question), a ruin
 wyrm may even acquiesce to using its spell-like abilities to aid the 
PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ruin wyrms speak Common, Draconic, and at least one other language (usually Giant).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Although a ruin wyrm is just as likely to use diplomacy 
to solve conflicts, it has no true fear of combat, and when fighting 
becomes necessary, they seem to relish the battle. The wyrm's greatest 
attack is its tail, which is a highly prehensile member that has 
surprising reach. They can also attack with four of their six talons, 
their bite, and a buffet from each of their wings if necessary. A ruin 
wyrm's bite attack always receives the creature's full Strength bonus to
 damage rolls, even though it is normally a secondary attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Once every 1d4 rounds, a ruin
 wyrm can breathe out a sphere of brilliant electricity, launching the 
sphere to any point up to a range of 100 feet. When the sphere reaches 
its target, it explodes into a 20-foot radius burst of dazzling energy, 
inflicting 14d8 points of electricity damage to all creatures in the 
area. A successful Reflex save (DC 26) halves the damage; a creature who
 fails this saving throw takes full damage and is blinded for 1d4 rounds
 unless it makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 26). The save DC is 
Constitution based.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the ruin wyrm wishes, it can instead breathe out four
 spheres, aiming each at different locations. Each of these spheres 
deals 3d8 points of electrical damage, exploding in a 20-foot-radius 
burst and possibly causing blindness as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a ruin 
wyrm must hit with its tail. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
 free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the 
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):</b> At will -- <i>arcane sight</i>, <i>detect secret doors</i>, <i>identify</i>, <i>summon monster I</i>, <i>tongues</i>; 3/day -- <i>dimension door</i>, <i>greater scrying</i>, <i>prying eyes</i>, <i>sending</i>, <i>summon monster V</i>, <i>vision</i>; 1/day -- <i>demand</i>, <i>spell resistance</i>, <i>summon monster VIII</i>.</p>
