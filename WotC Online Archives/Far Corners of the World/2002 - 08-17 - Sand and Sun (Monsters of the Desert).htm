Deserts also serve as havens for those that seek to avoid the law, such

seek a place to hide and rebuild their strength after being forced to

<p class="size2">The dreaded boneworm is an amalgamation of dead 
desert-dwelling monks and priests. The insane tangle of bodies is fueled
 by a hatred of the deity and religion that failed to protect them all 
from starvation, thirst, and general insanity.</p>
<p class="size2">A boneworm is a massive creature that rarely measures 
less than 50 feet in length. Its wormlike shape consists of a mass of 
thousands of charred bones bound together by a thin membrane of tendons 
and scorched, leathery flesh. Hundreds of half-formed faces -- faces of 
the bodies the boneworm formed from -- press out of the leathery flesh 
at random points on the creature. These faces constantly contort into 
expressions of madness or rage, and they endlessly cry out twisted hymns
 and warped prayers to mock those deities they once revered.</p>
<p class="size2">The original boneworm came into existence when a large 
monastery located in the depths of a desert suddenly succumbed to a 
terrible disease known as bonefire. Some believe this disease came from 
one of the lower planes or even the Elemental Plane of Fire. In any 
case, the disease spread quickly, causing its victims to burn to death 
from the inside out as their skeletons became infused with terrible 
heat. It wasn't until after the victims died that the true purpose of 
the disease made itself known: The bodies of those who died of bonefire 
drew together and began to grow numerous new bones. The bones twisted 
together in a terrible braid of bone and dead flesh until it finally 
formed the monstrous abomination known as a boneworm.</p>
<p class="size2">Boneworms have little interest in communicating with anyone, but they do understand the Common tongue.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A boneworm is a near mindless entity. The combined 
madness of the dozens of undead bodies that comprise its being leaves 
little room for organized thought or combat tactics. As a result, a 
boneworm simply slithers toward any living creatures it detects and 
attacks them by rearing up and slamming them with its body.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Desiccation Aura (Su):</b> Living creatures within 
30 feet of a boneworm are subject to the monster's desiccation aura. 
Each round, a victim of this aura must make a Fortitude save (DC 19) or 
suffer 1 point of Constitution drain as moisture seeps from his body 
through the skin and slips through the air toward the boneworm. The 
boneworm heals 5 points of damage each round its aura desiccates living 
creatures (despite the total amount of Constitution drain inflicted, 
since a portion of the moisture is lost to evaporation), gaining any 
excess as temporary hit points. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Disease (Ex): </b>Any creature hit by a boneworm's 
slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or contract 
bonefire. The incubation period is instantaneous, and the disease deals 
1d4 points of temporary Charisma damage and 1d4 points of temporary 
Constitution damage (see Disease, in the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>).
 Victims of bonefire break into fevers as their bones pulsate with light
 and heat. They stink of cooked flesh, and their skeletons become 
visible from within their blistering bodies after two hours (unless the 
victim is treated effectively). Bonefire is highly contagious and is 
also transmitted by physical contact. Anyone who touches a person or 
creature diseased with bonefire (whether victims are alive or dead) must
 make a Fortitude save (DC 19) or catch the disease. A dead body remains
 infected with bonefire for a week after its death, whereupon the 
skeleton finally burns out in a spectacular flash of light. If at any 
time 18 or more bodies infected with bonefire are located within 30 feet
 of each other, the bodies rapidly meld together, as if drawn by a fell 
telekinesis, to a point at the center of the spread. Over the course of 
only 1 round, the bodies bind together and form a boneworm with a number
 of Hit Dice equal to the number of bodies that formed it.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dreadful Chanting (Su): </b>A boneworm's numerous 
mouths constantly chant half-remembered hymns and prayers. This 
chanting, consisting as it does of dozens of different hymns, sounds 
like a swarm of giant flies trying to mimic human voices with their 
buzzing. This effect unnerves and disturbs the living, especially those 
who can cast divine spells. A living creature within 90 feet of a 
chanting boneworm must make a Will saving throw (DC 19) against this 
mind-affecting, sonic fear effect or become shaken. Divine spellcasters 
suffer a -4 penalty on this saving throw. A shaken creature suffers a -2
 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws. 
Additionally, a divine spellcaster must make a successful Concentration 
check (DC 20 + spell level) to cast a spell in the area of the 
boneworm's chanting.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Subtype: </b>A boneworm is immune to fire 
damage but takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for half 
damage is allowed. In that case, it takes half damage on a success and 
double damage on a failure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Undead Traits: </b>A boneworm is immune to poison, 
sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic 
effects, mind-influencing effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude 
save unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical 
hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. 
Negative energy heals it, and it is not at risk of death from massive 
damage but is destroyed at 0 hit points or less. A boneworm has 
darkvision (60-foot range). It cannot be raised, and resurrection works 
only if it is willing.</p>

<p class="size2">The fiery sandhog is a brutish and constantly hungry 
creature that uses the sands of the desert to catch and immobilize its 
prey.</p>
<p class="size2">The fiery sandhog looks only superficially like a 
large, bald razorback hog. A spiny row of crystalline spikes runs down 
its back and bristles on its shoulders. Its powerful legs end in large, 
clawed flippers that can propel it through sand and loose earth with 
surprising speed. Its vaguely boarlike head splits at the snout into 
four long trunks, each of which ends in a fanged maw. A pair of beady, 
feral red eyes glares from its face, belying its underlying intelligence
 and cunning. </p>
<p class="size2">Fiery sandhogs hunt in packs and are constantly on the 
move through their desert hunting grounds. They do not make permanent 
lairs. Often, a particularly aggressive or brutal sandhog goes rogue and
 strikes out on its own; these sandhogs are usually much larger in size 
and are truly dangerous menaces.</p>
<p class="size2">Fiery sandhogs do not speak any languages themselves, 
although most of them can understand the Common tongue. They communicate
 with their own kind with a complex series of grunts and squeals.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A fiery sandhog waits patiently under the surface of 
the sand for victims to come within range of its control sand ability so
 that it can immobilize them. Once its victims are caught, the sandhog 
burrows up as cautiously as possible to poison them. When the sandhog 
fights foes it cannot entrap with its control sand ability or affect 
with poison, it retreats and lashes out with its heat ray.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Heat Ray (Su): </b>A sandhog collects heat from the 
sun in the spiny protrusions on its back and shoulders. It can focus 
this energy into a 70-foot-long ray of heat, which does 2d6 points of 
fire damage to the victim with a successful ranged touch attack.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Poison (Ex): </b>The sandhog's poison causes the 
victim's muscles to burn with pain and cramp up, which reduces agility 
and eventually renders the victim immobile. A fiery sandhog delivers its
 poison (Fortitude save DC 13) with each successful bite attack. The 
initial and secondary damage is the same (1d4 points of temporary 
Strength damage). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Control Sand (Su): </b>A fiery sandhog can control 
the density of sand, loose soil, and gravel to a range of 140 feet. It 
can affect a radius of 20 feet of sand. As a standard action, the 
sandhog can make the sand or soil in this area flow like water to a 
depth of 3 feet for a brief instant. Any Large or smaller creature in 
this area must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 13) to avoid losing its 
footing. Those who succeed stay atop the sand, while those who fail 
become trapped in the sand when it resumes its normal density a few 
seconds later. Such victims cannot move from their location and suffer a
 -2 circumstance penalty to their Dexterity scores until they escape. 
Escape from the sand is possible with a Strength check or an Escape 
Artist check (DC 21); each attempt requires a full round action.</p>

<p class="size2">The desert holds innumerable secrets. Those who 
penetrate to the depths of a vast desert and survive the inhospitable 
terrain, heat, and monsters always emerge with tales of how the desert 
itself seemed to rise up against them, repelling intruders from the true
 depths of its reaches. These explorers, unwitting or not, have 
encountered one of the most powerful and dangerous denizens of the 
desert: the mysterious siabrie.</p>
<p class="size2">The siabrie rarely appears to outsiders, and then 
usually when the intruder has earned its wrath. Few can survive the full
 focus of an angry siabrie, so word of their existence is slow to 
spread. A siabrie looks like a beautiful or handsome humanoid, with 
willowy arms and long, golden hair. Its skin is coppery and upon close 
inspection seems to be made of fine sand. Its wings are glimmering and 
crystalline, like stained glass, and its eyes are like the most 
beautiful of desert sunsets. But when angered, a siabrie undergoes a 
terrible transformation. Its skin runs like glass and glows with fire, 
and its face and eyes burn with a seething rage like the light of a 
thousand suns. An angry siabrie's form shifts rapidly between bestial 
and humanoid as its rage is made flesh.</p>
<p class="size2">A siabrie's territory in a large desert can extend over
 dozens of square miles, and each one is perfectly content to wander its
 dunes and cliffs alone. Nevertheless, every few hundred years, a 
siabrie can grow lonely and seek out the companionship of others of its 
kind. When a siabrie cannot find other siabries to visit at these times,
 it has been known to assume the form of a humanoid and visit 
communities for entertainment. Rarely, a group of up to seven siabries 
congregates in one area of the desert, either to share knowledge and 
companionship or to band together to repel a particularly dangerous or 
vile threat to their homes. For the most part, though, they avoid crowds
 and are content to live their immortal lives alone.</p>
<p class="size2">Siabries can understand and speak any language, as long
 as the speaker is in the siabrie's desert. Otherwise, they can 
communicate in Auran, Ignan, Sylvan, and Terran.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">An angry siabrie is a force to be reckoned with. It 
tries to repulse undesirables from its domain using its formidable 
spell-like abilities, its sonorous voice attack, and by awakening the 
very desert itself to drive them off. If these tactics fail, the siabrie
 manifests in the thick of the intruders and lays waste to them with its
 touch. A siabrie's touch burns and desiccates tissue, and it erodes 
away unliving targets like undead and constructs. Damage done is 1d10 
points plus additional damage equal to the siabrie's Charisma modifier. 
The siabrie makes full use of Whirlwind Attack and Spring Attack with 
this devastating touch, and, against those creatures who can outrun it, 
the creature calls up stinging blasts of burning sand out of nothingness
 to strike at a distance of up to 100 feet (and up to 10 range 
increments).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gaze of Ruin (Su):</b> Anyone within 30 feet of a 
siabrie who meets the creature's glowing red eyes must succeed at a Will
 saving throw (DC 24) against this mind-affecting fear effect or become 
overwhelmed with feelings of hopelessness and despair; these victims can
 do nothing but sink to the ground and sob until the siabrie leaves or 
deactivates her gaze weapon. Such victims are considered to be helpless.
 Siabries are immune to their own gaze attacks and to those of others of
 their kind. They can suppress this gaze weapon as a free action; when 
it is active the siabrie's eyes shine with a blinding light that 
illuminates a 60-foot radius.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sandtouch (Su): </b>Any creature damaged by a 
siabrie's touch attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 22) or 
turn to nonmagic sand. A creature slain in this manner can be restored 
to life only by a <i>miracle</i>, <i>true resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sonorous Voice (Su): </b>As a full round action, a 
siabrie can lower the pitch of its voice and increase the volume so as 
to sound like the wind blowing over hollows in the rocks or dunes. The 
creature can maintain the sonorous voice for up to 1 minute by 
concentrating; each minute the radius of its effect increases by one 
mile. Each living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or greater in the 
area of effect must make a Will saving throw each round (DC 24) or 
become shaken. A shaken character who fails to save against this ability
 becomes frightened. A frightened creature who fails to save becomes 
panicked. A panicked creature who fails to save is rendered unconscious.
 All conditions imparted by this ability persist for 1d10 rounds after 
the siabrie ceases to use the ability. This is a mind-affecting, sonic, 
fear effect. A siabrie can use its sonorous voice once per hour.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>At will -- <i>barkskin, 
create water, cure moderate wounds, detect magic, endure elements, 
faerie fire, flare, greater dispelling, heat metal, meld into stone, 
pass without trace, produce flame, protection from flame, spike stones, 
word of recall; </i>3/day--<i>call lightning, control winds, flame strike, heal, shapechange, stone tell, wall of stone;</i> 1/day--<i>antipathy, control weather, creeping doom, fire storm, sunbeam, sunburst, sympathy, whirlwind, wind walk.</i> Caster level 15th; save DC 17 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Awaken Desert (Su): </b>Once per day, a siabrie can awaken the dormant spirits of the desert. Treat this as an <i>elemental swarm</i>
 spell cast by a 20th-level druid, except that all of the elementals 
appear at once. The elementals summoned can be of any type but water 
elementals. Air elementals summoned by this ability appear as swirling 
clouds of sand, and their attacks gain +1d10 bonus damage from the 
scouring grit. Earth elementals summoned by this ability appear as 
shifting humanoid mounds of sand. They are immune to piercing damage. 
Fire elementals summoned by this ability are incredibly fast. They gain a
 +4 haste bonus to their AC and have a speed of 80 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Absorb Fire (Su): </b>A siabrie can absorb any fire 
spell or effect that strikes it. This immediately negates the effect and
 grants a number of temporary hit points to the siabrie equal to the 
fire damage that normally would have been done. If the fire effect was a
 permanent magical effect (such as a flaming weapon), the effect is 
merely suppressed for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Desert Awareness (Su): </b>While in a desert, a siabrie uses the environment to best advantage. The creature cannot be flanked, can detect <i>invisible</i> creatures as if under the effects of a <i>see invisibility</i> spell (caster level 15th), and is immune to all mind-affecting attacks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Damage dealt to a siabrie is 
treated as subdual damage, which automatically heals at a rate of 5 
points per round. Cold and lawful attacks (this includes lawful spells 
that do damage, lawful weapons, and the natural attacks of lawful 
outsiders) deal normal damage to the creature, which doesn't go away. 
Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage ignore regeneration, and 
it does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or 
suffocation.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Siabrie Characters</b></p>
<p class="size2">A siabrie's favored class is sorcerer, although many siabrie become druids, as well.</p>
