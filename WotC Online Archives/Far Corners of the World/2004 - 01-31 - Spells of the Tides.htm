<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2001-31%20-%20Spells%20of%20the%20Tides_files/fw_tide_med.jpg" alt="Island - Rob Alexander" title="Island - Rob Alexander" border="1" align="right" height="131" width="179">The
 coastline of a newly discovered region is often the first place to 
become civilized. Most large cities are, as a result, the oldest cities 
in a nation, as well as the largest and most cosmopolitan. Nonetheless, 
vast reaches of uncivilized coastline stretch for miles, and these 
shores are often deemed too remote, too dangerous, or just too rugged to
 civilize. It was a combination of these three qualities that consigned a
 particular reach of coastline to perpetual wilderness; this far corner 
of the world has resisted numerous attempts at colonization, all of 
which have resulted in failure. It has become known as the Lost Coast.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Barlen's Crabwalk</span><br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target:</b> Creature touched <br><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">The story goes that this unusual spell was created by a 
somewhat unhinged wizard that lived on the Lost Coast. This wizard, a 
human named Barlen, became obsessed with tidal life, crabs in 
particular, and during high tide he spent his time researching spells to
 make a humanoid's body and limbs function more like those of his 
beloved pets. Most of these spells amounted to nothing, and many believe
 that his final spell, a variant on <i>polymorph,</i> turned him forever into a crab himself.</p>
<p align="left">Of all his spells, <i>Barlen's crabwalk</i> alone has 
gained a bit of notoriety. Although Barlen doubtless designed this spell
 to allow a humanoid creature to approximate the erratic sideways 
scuttling of a crab, the spell's effects are quite effective in combat.</p>
<p align="left">A creature under the effect of <i>Barlen's crabwalk</i> 
moves with increased speed, scuttling about to the left or right with 
disconcerting ease. The target's land speed is increased by 20 feet. 
(This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) Additionally, the 
target's quickness grants a +4 bonus to his Armor Class when he is 
attacked as a result of provoking an attack of opportunity. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component:</i> A crab's leg.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Healing Surf</span><br></b>Conjuration (Healing)<br><b>Level:</b> Clr 4<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br><b>Range:</b> Short (25 ft. + 5 ft./caster level)<br><b>Target:</b> Caster, plus one additional creature per 3 caster levels<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">To cast this spell, you must be standing at least up to 
the knees in ocean surf; all additional creatures to be targeted by the 
effects of the healing surf must also be standing in the surf and within
 range of the spell. The surf qualifies as vigorous motion, and to cast 
in such conditions you must make a successful Concentration check (DC 
10).</p>
<p align="left">When the ten-minute casting time of this spell is 
achieved, you and up to three creatures per caster level selected by you
 are immediately healed of 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 
50 points). Additionally, the healing surf removes all trace of disease 
on the targets, as well as the following conditions: ability damage (but
 not ability drain), exhaustion, fatigue, nauseated, and sickened. For 
the remainder of the spell's duration, the targets gain a +4 sacred 
bonus on all saving throws against effects that cause ability damage, 
exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, and sickened conditions.</p>
<p align="left">Undead targets are damaged by the positive energy 
unleashed by this spell, and they take 5 points of damage per caster 
level (or half on a successful Will save). For the remainder of the 
spell's duration, any undead that survive this damage are treated as 4 
Hit Dice lower than their actual total when determining the effects of 
turn or rebuke undead attempts.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component</i>: 500 gp in pearls.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Kelpstrand</span><br></b>Conjuration (Creation)<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> One strand of animated kelp/3 levels<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">This spell causes a number of long strands of tough kelp
 to shoot out of your outstretched hands. You make a ranged touch attack
 when you cast <i>kelpstrand</i>. If you hit a creature with the <i>kelpstrand</i>,
 you immediately make a special opposed grapple check against this 
creature as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, 
adding your caster level and Wisdom bonus to the result of your grapple 
check rather than your Strength bonus and size bonus. If you succeed, 
the target becomes entangled in the thick strands of kelp and is 
considered to be grappling. The target moves at half speed and takes a 
-2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity. The target 
doesn't threaten any squares and loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor 
Class entirely. Each round, the target can attempt to escape the <i>kelpstrand</i> by making a successful grapple check or Escape Artist check against the <i>kelpstrand's</i>
 special grapple check. You are not considered grappling yourself while 
using this spell. Once you shoot your strands of kelp, you need not take
 any action to maintain the effect. If your attack misses, the spell's 
effect is wasted.</p>
<p align="left">If you can create more than one <i>kelpstrand</i>, you 
can direct the strands at any different targets in range, or all against
 a single target. A creature targeted with multiple <i>kelpstrands</i> has to make separate Grapple checks or Escape Artist checks against every <i>kelpstrand</i> currently grappling him to escape.</p>
<p align="left">If you cast this spell while you are within 300 feet of 
the ocean shore, the kelp is particularly strong and tenacious, and you 
gain a +4 bonus on any grapple checks made to determine the outcome of a
 <i>kelpstrand</i> grapple.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component</i>: A piece of dried seaweed.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Red Tide</span><br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 8<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> Burst in the shape of a circular disk, 10 ft. wide/level, 5 ft. high<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">This visually impressive spell causes a surging, 
frothing wave of thick, red seawater to wash over everything in the 
area. All creatures in the area of a <i>red tide</i> are immediately 
knocked prone and must make a Fortitude saving throw. Flying or swimming
 creatures in the area aren't knocked prone, but they suffer a -4 
penalty on the Fortitude save.</p>
<p align="left">A creature that makes its Fortitude save against a red 
tide is sickened for 1 minute and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, 
saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for that time. A 
creature that fails this saving throw is horribly ruined by the 
poisonous effects of the tide. Such creatures are immediately nauseated 
for 1 minute, and they take 3d6 points of temporary Strength damage. 
After 1 minute, the nausea ends but the creature must make a second 
Fortitude saving throw or take an additional 3d6 points of temporary 
Strength damage. Creatures that are immune to poison are immune to these
 effects of a red tide.</p>
<p align="left">The tainted water evoked by this spell vanishes after a 
few seconds of turbulence, and any objects or creatures in the area do 
not emerge wet. All open flames in the area are nevertheless 
extinguished if they fail a Reflex save; likewise, all creatures with 
the Fire subtype take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 
20d6), or half with a successful Reflex save.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Saltray</span><br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Short (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> Ray<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">This spell creates an instantaneous thin beam of salt crystals. A creature struck by a <i>saltray</i>
 takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) 
and must make a Fortitude save or be stunned by the excruciating pain of
 the wound for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p align="left">If this spell is cast within 300 feet of the shoreline of a large body of salt water, a second <i>saltray</i> is created. You can target this second <i>saltray</i> as you see fit against any target in range of the spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Sirine's Grace</span><br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 4, Drd 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left"><i>Sirine's grace</i> infuses you with the otherworldly 
grace and fey magic of the sirines that dwell along the shores of the 
Lost Coast. As this spell is cast, these energies suffuse your body and 
enhance your physical characteristics, granting you a +4 enhancement 
bonus to Charisma and Dexterity.</p>
<p align="left">For the duration of this spell, you gain a deflection 
bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class and a +8 bonus
 on Perform checks. You also gain a supernatural touch attack that you 
can invoke once per round as a free action. Anyone hit by your touch 
attack takes 1d4 points of temporary Intelligence damage (or 2d4 points 
on a critical hit). Alternatively, you can use this touch attack to 
restore 1d6 points of temporary Intelligence damage caused by this spell
 or by a sirine?s touch.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component</i>: A lock of hair, freely given to you by a living sirine.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size2red">Undertow</span><br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 1, Sor/Wiz 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> 20-ft.-radius burst<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">This spell causes a sudden and violent current to tear 
through all liquids in the spell's area. Water in open containers 
splashes outward; open containers carried by creatures do not spill if 
their carrier makes a Fortitude saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">The currents created by this spell in larger bodies of 
water (or other liquid) are quite strong. All creatures in contact with 
the water must make a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.</p>
