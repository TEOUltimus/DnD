 the lure of discovery and the thrill of exploration is often enough to 
beckon some adventurers into the remote lost cities of the world, these 
reasons pale in comparison to the relentless hunt for magic items. In 
many cases, the denizens of these ancient cities fled their homes, or 
may even have perished within them. Who knows what wondrous discoveries 
might still lie hidden in forgotten vaults buried under these exotic 
ruins? Certainly these ancient magic items are equally as exotic, and 
they are often as unusual in shape as they are in function. The entries 
below highlight several examples of ancient magic dredged up from the 
lost city.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Durakistad Coin (Major Artifact):</b> The 
citizens of the ancient city of Durakistad lived lives of comfort and 
ease. Their leaders, powerful wizards and sorcerers, were both benign 
and generous as they were powerful. They used their amazing magical 
powers to benefit the citizens of the city, providing for food, water, 
comfort, entertainment, and whatever else they desired. Then 
Durakistad's most arrogant noble announced his intention to allow 
visitors to join the city if only they would venerate his house with all
 the faith and fervor one would give to one's church. With this 
pronouncement, the gods finally grew weary of the city's hubris. They 
visited seven signs of their displeasure upon Durakistad, and as its 
citizens ignored or mocked each one, the next grew more dire and 
ominous. When the citizens used their magic to sweep aside the seventh 
plague (a flesh-rending wind) with ease, the gods decided to punish the 
entire city. If they deigned themselves as so great and important, it 
would be only just that their greatness be preserved for all eternity. 
With an instant's divine wrath, the gods transformed every person, every
 animal, and every building in the city to purest gold, and then shrank 
the city down to the size of a coin, where their splendor could last 
forever.</p>
<p align="left">The transformation of Durakistad into a coin perpetually
 imprisoned the citizens of the city, yet did not blunt their awareness.
 Each of the city's cursed citizens is horribly, painfully aware of the 
passage of time, and of the passage of their city from uncouth hand to 
uncouth hand. Their only moments of respite come when someone realizes 
the true purpose of the coin.</p>
<p align="left">Once per day as a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fullroundaction')">full-round action</a>,
 a person who holds the coin can transport himself into the coin's 
pocket dimension, along with any willing creatures (and any gear they 
carry) within a 20-foot-radius. Once inside this pocket dimension, the 
user and his allies find themselves in a thriving city with a golden sky
 -- a utopian paradise where plague, hunger, and warfare do not exist. 
Only during the visits of the coin's owner can the citizens of 
Durakistad once again enjoy life. Unfortunately, they must obey the 
every command and desire of the coin owner, and they can take no actions
 on their own to engineer their escape or the restoration of their city.
 Yet they do not treat the coin owner poorly, for to do so invites wrath
 and a return to horrible conscious imprisonment.</p>
<p align="left">Time spent in Durakistad is not connected to time in the
 real world. No matter how long visitors remain in the coin city, time 
does not pass in the real world; when they return, they return to the 
same location and at the same time as when they activated the artifact. 
In this way, a group of adventurers can use the coin to rest, regain 
their spells, and heal wounds. If they bring along the raw materials 
necessary they can even use their stay in Durakistad to create magic 
items. Nothing "native" to Durakistad can be taken out into the real 
world, but objects and people can certainly be stranded there. The coin 
itself ceases to exist as long as its owner and his allies are staying 
in the city. Only the one who activated the coin in the first place can 
transport himself and his allies back to the real world; doing so is a 
free action for this individual. Any allies who wish to return with him 
must be within 20 feet of him at the time he activates the coin, 
otherwise they become stranded in the coin, trapped but conscious just 
as the citizens of Drakistad are. Stranded creatures cannot escape until
 someone else uses the coin in the real world to access the city. 
Citizens of Drakistad cannot be rescued from the city in this way. Since
 only willing subjects can travel to the coin, using it as a prison for 
one's enemies is difficult, but if you can trick an enemy to come along 
for the ride, escape is nigh impossible.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately, a hidden danger exists for those who stay
 in Durakistad. Each day, visitors (but not the owner) must make a 
successful Will <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">save</a> (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_difficultyclass')">DC</a> 10 + 1 per previous check). Failure indicates the victim suffers 1d20 points of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Wisdom')">Wisdom</a><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydrain')"> drain</a>.
 A character drained to 0 Wisdom is immediately restored to his normal 
Wisdom score, but she has forevermore become a citizen of Durakistad and
 cannot escape the coin city until the artifact is destroyed.</p>
<p align="left">The actual method of destroying the <i>Durakistad Coin</i>
 is unknown; the deities who created it certainly aren't talking. If, 
however, someone destroys it, the city could simply vanish forever, or 
it could return to its full glory on the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_MaterialPlane')">Material Plane</a>. The implications for such a sudden return could be great, especially if Durakistad's location has been resettled!</p>
<p align="left">Overwhelming transmutation; CL 30th.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elixir of Treasure Finding:</b> Lost cities are 
ancient places, and more often than not countless adventurers and 
treasure seekers have explored them. Any items of obvious value were 
long ago looted in most cases, often leaving only the most hidden 
treasure vaults and catacombs under the city unspoiled. A particularly 
greedy sorcerer created the first <i>elixirs of treasure finding</i> 
since he had neither the patience nor the skill required to seek out by 
conventional means the treasures he knew were hidden just below his 
feet.</p>
<p align="left">An <i>elixir of treasure finding</i> appears as a thin 
runny liquid, often kept in a plain clay or cheap crystal vial. When 
imbibed, the drinker is overwhelmed with a disorienting feeling of 
vertigo -- for 1d4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">rounds</a>, she is <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_stunned')">stunned</a>.
 When this sensation passes, her senses seem more potent. Colors seem 
more vibrant, sounds seem clearer, and so on; this grants the character a
 +5 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_competencebonus')">competence bonus</a> on Listen, Search, and Spot <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">checks</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The elixir's primary function, though, is to point the 
drinker in the direction of the closest sizable repository of treasure. 
When the character drinks the elixir, her mind momentarily expands to 
encompass her surroundings. Any treasure or magic items within 30 feet 
of the character at the time she drinks are considered too close, and 
they remain hidden due to the potent magic of the elixir itself.</p>
<p align="left">Beyond this 30-foot radius "eye of the storm," the 
effects of the elixir extend outward 100 feet per character level of the
 drinker. The elixir homes in on the nearest sizable treasure horde and 
imprints the direction and distance to the hoard in the drinker's mind. 
For purposes of this elixir, a sizable hoard is any treasure hoard of an
 Encounter Level of 11 or higher, or the gear of an NPC of 8th level or 
higher. If no such treasure hoard or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonplayercharacter')">nonplayer character</a> is located in range, the drinker can still enjoy the skill bonuses for the elixir's duration.</p>
<p align="left">If the imbiber locates a suitable treasure, she can 
sense the direction and distance the treasure is located at from her 
current location. This treasure sense provides no indication of any 
dangers that may lurk along the route to the treasure, and it also does 
not indicate a path (although the drinker's improved sensory skills 
should aid in discovering a route). The effects of an <i>elixir of treasure finding</i> persist for only 1 hour, but once they fade, knowledge of the treasure's existence does not.</p>
<p align="left">The wealth of the treasure is overrided by the proximity
 when the elixir is imbibed; the drinker might be within range of a 
dozen EL 20 treasures, but if the closest is only an EL 13 treasure, she
 does not gain any special insight into any other treasures; the elixir 
locates only a single stash of treasure.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>find the path</i>; Price 6,000 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Globe of Danger Detection:</b> This handy, one-shot magic item appears as a 2-inch diameter glass globe filled with sparkling white sand or powder. A <i>globe of danger detection</i> can be <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_thrownweapon')">thrown</a>
 up to 30 feet; when it strikes a surface, it shatters and the dust 
within coats everything in a 10-foot-burst. The dust can detect traps 
(both mechanical and magical), and it glows softly along triggering 
mechanisms and other dangerous parts of hidden traps that are located in
 this burst area. Creatures searching for traps in this area may do so 
as if they had rogue levels, and they gain a +10 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_insightbonus')">insight bonus</a>
 on their Search check to find any traps within the area. The dust 
within remains potent for 1d10 minutes once the item is activated.</p>
<p align="left">Strong divination; CL 20th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>find traps</i>; Price 2,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Headband of Lore:</b> Adventurers, especially those who intend to explore lost cities, covet <i>headbands of lore</i>.
 The wearer of a headband of lore gains a +5 competence bonus on all 
Knowledge checks (including bardic knowledge checks). The wearer must 
have at least one <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillrank')">rank</a> in the Knowledge skill she's using to take advantage of this bonus. Once a day, the wearer can use an <i>analyze dweomer</i> spell. Also once per day, the wearer can perform a <i>legend lore</i> on an item or site by studying it for 1 minute.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>identify</i>, <i>legend lore</i>; Price 50,000 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jade Talon:</b> A <i>jade talon</i> is a gauntlet made of jade slats that cover the wrist and hand. Long, curving jade talons extend out over the fingers. A <i>jade talon</i> functions as a <i>+2 wounding spiked gauntlet</i>, except that it deals slashing <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a> rather than piercing damage.</p>
<p align="left">Yet the jade talon's most impressive function is tied to
 its religious roots. A successful DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check 
reveals that ancient cultists of evil sky spirits or avian deities used 
the talon; the deities demanded bloody sacrifice from their priests. If a
 successful hit with a <i>jade talon</i> ever reduces a living creature to negative <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a> but does not kill the creature, the talon immediately generates a <i>death knell</i> effect heightened to a 5th-level spell on the victim. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effects of the <i>death knell</i>,
 otherwise, the victim is slain as the talons slash into the victim and 
pierce the heart (if the victim has one). The wearer gains 1d8 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_temporaryhitpoints')">temporary hit points</a> and a +2 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a>, and his caster level increases by +1. These effects last for 10 minutes per <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDie')">Hit Die</a>
 of the subject creature. Note that the talon's retrieval of the 
victim's heart occurs with blinding speed -- the gauntlet is off the 
wearer's hand only for an instant, which allows him to continue with 
multiple attack sequences if possible.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Jade talons</i> radiate strong evil. Although good 
creatures can wear them without immediate effects, constant use of the 
talon should eventually shift the wearer's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_alignment')">alignment</a> toward evil.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>death knell</i>, <i>Mordenkainen's sword</i>; Price 72,305 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jaguar Mask:</b> The extravagantly bejeweled <i>jaguar mask</i>
 fits over the upper portion of a person's face, leaving the lower jaw 
exposed. The mask resembles a snarling jaguar's head, but with the lower
 jaw missing. When worn, the mask takes up the goggle item slot. While 
worn, the mask grants the wearer <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lowlightvision')">low-light vision</a> and a +2 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_enhancementbonus')">enhancement bonus</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a>. The wearer may <i>speak with animals</i> (felines only) at will.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>alter self</i> or wildshape ability, <i>cat's grace</i>, <i>speak with animals</i>; Price 16,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.</p>
