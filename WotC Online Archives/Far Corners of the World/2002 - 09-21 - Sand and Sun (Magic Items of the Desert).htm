<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p class="size2">Although the desert is a cruel and inhospitable place, 
magic makes exploration of its secret dunes and empty wastes not only 
possible, but in many cases, almost comfortable. Items like the <i>robe of the burning lands, </i>the <i>cactus cloak</i>, and the <i>ring of sand</i>
 are much sought after rarities for adventurers who find themselves with
 a need to delve deeply into the desert. Unfortunately for the traveler,
 the desert harbors just as many offensive magic creations that find 
their way into the hands of its inhabitants. Items like the <i>sand of ruin</i>, <i>sand of the ages</i>, <i>scimitar of stonestriking</i>, and the <i>glass of entombing</i>
 have often given the denizens of the desert just the edge they need to 
defeat unwanted intrusions of adventurers. Of course, if an adventurer 
can weather these magical attacks, he or she can often claim these 
mighty treasures as his or her own.</p>
<p class="size2">Although many of these items retain their usefulness 
outside of desert environs, they rarely should be encountered outside of
 the sandy wastes of the desert, for the secrets of their creation are 
jealously guarded by the denizens therein.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Cactus Cloak:</b> Hundreds of tiny cactus needles cover the green <i>cactus cloak</i>.
 When worn, the cloak moves and flows so that its wearer never need fear
 being pricked by the needles. The cactus cloak acts as masterwork armor
 spikes, even if the wearer isn't wearing armor. When used as armor 
spikes, the wearer gains proficiency in their use. They do 1d6 points of
 piercing damage (x2 crit) on a successful grapple and count as a light 
weapon when used as a melee weapon (see Armor Descriptions in Chapter 7 
of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Once per day, the wearer can whip the 
cloak in a chosen direction and fire a volley of needles. This volley of
 needles fills a 30-foot-long cone; all creatures in this area must make
 a Reflex save (DC 17) or suffer 9d6 points of piercing damage. This 
damage is physical and is subject to damage reduction. Those who succeed
 at the saving throw take half damage.</p>
<p class="size2">Also, by wrapping the cloak about the body, the wearer 
can assume the shape of a Medium-size cactus; doing so is a standard 
action. The wearer can remain in cactus form for up to 9 hours. Once 
deactivated, this power cannot be activated again for 24 hours. The 
closest inspection cannot reveal that the cactus is anything other than a
 normal cactus, unless magic such as <i>detect magic</i> or <i>true seeing</i>
 is used. While in cactus form, the wearer can observe all that 
transpires around him as if he were in his normal form. The wearer's hit
 points and saving throws are unaffected. A wearer gains a +10 natural 
armor bonus to AC but has an effective Dexterity score of 1. The wearer 
is also immune to critical hits while in cactus form, and all clothing 
and gear carried or worn changes with him. The wearer can dismiss the 
cactus form as a free action.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 9th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, s<i>pike growth</i>, <i>tree shape</i>, creation must occur in a desert; <i>Market Price:</i> 24,700 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 2 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Glass of Entombing: </b>Only a few potent and terrible <i>glass of entombing</i> devices are rumored to exist; most of them belong to cruel despots of desert empires or powerful genies. A <i>glass of entombing</i>
 is a 1-foot-high crystalline hourglass set within a framework of wood 
and bone. The sands of the glass are golden and quite fine. It keeps 
perfect time; the sands take precisely an hour to drain from the upper 
container into the lower one. A <i>glass of entombing</i> must be 
attuned to an owner before it can be used; this requires the owner to 
meditate before the glass for 1 hour while she concentrates upon the 
sand flowing through the device. Once the glass is attuned, the owner 
gains the spell-like ability to cast a <i>dune tomb</i> spell (see Far Corners of the World: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/fw/fw20020720a">Spells of the Desert</a>) once per day, as long as she remains on the same plane as her <i>glass of entombing</i>.
 Unlike the spell, she can target only one creature with each casting of
 the spell, but that creature need not be in contact with a sand dune. 
If the target succumbs to the spell, it is instead reduced in size and 
magically imprisoned in the sands of the <i>glass of entombing</i>. Once
 a creature is imprisoned, the glass flips over so the sand is in the 
upper receptacle, but the sand does not begin to drain into the lower 
receptacle. As long as the owner of the glass does not ask any questions
 of the imprisoned creature, the sand remains frozen in time and the 
victim remains trapped. While trapped, the victim is completely mobile 
and can wander the seemingly endless and lifeless dunes trapped in the 
glass. The victim does not age or suffer damage, and it cannot harm 
itself whatsoever. Nevertheless, the victim's thirst and hunger continue
 to grow in its mind (even though it cannot die of thirst or 
starvation), and the terrible loneliness of the eternal desert within 
the glass preys upon its mind and causes Wisdom damage as if it were 
under the effects of a <i>dune tomb</i> spell. (Each day that passes 
after the initial entombing, a victim must make a Will save (DC 21) or 
suffer 1 point of permanent Wisdom drain as its mind slowly begins to 
fall apart under the strain.)</p>
<p class="size2">As with the <i>dune tomb</i> spell, the caster can mentally communicate with the entombed victim (as with a <i>sending</i>
 spell). For the duration of this communication, the sand runs normally.
 Thus, the owner of the glass can communicate with her prisoner for up 
to an hour before the sand runs out. Once the sand runs out, or once the
 owner is slain, the imprisoned creature is immediately transported back
 to the location it was at just before it became entombed. A creature 
trapped in a <i>glass of entombing</i> is also released if the glass's owner traps a new creature in it, or if the glass itself is destroyed. Destroying a <i>glass of entombing</i> can be difficult, for it has hardness 25 and 150 hit points. As long as the item has hit points left, any damage done to a <i>glass of entombing</i>
 can be repaired by inverting the glass and allowing the sands to run 
out the hour; naturally, the glass cannot be so repaired if it is 
currently imprisoning a victim.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 15th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft (glassblowing) 15 ranks, Craft Wondrous Item, d<i>une tomb</i>, <i>sending</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 144,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 10 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Ring of Sand: </b>A <i>ring of sand</i> is a rough 
circlet of sandstone shot through with reds and yellows and oranges. 
This ring allows the wearer to pass over sand, gravel, or loose soil 
without leaving a trail. Tracking the subject is impossible by 
nonmagical means. The wearer of a <i>ring of sand</i> can also merge 
with any amount of gravel or sand large enough to hide his body 
completely, in a manner identical to that granted by a <i>meld into stone</i>
 spell. The wearer can maintain this condition for up to 2 hours, 
although he cannot move while melded with the sand. Finally, up to three
 times per day the wearer can use its <i>dimension door</i> effect, 
provided that the point of initiation and the destination are connected 
by a continuous reach of sand. When this power activates, the wearer of 
the ring appears to melt away into sand and then reform at the 
destination point.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 12th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Forge Ring, <i>dimension door, meld into stone, pass without trace</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 139,200 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Robe of the Burning Lands:</b> The <i>robe of the burning lands</i>
 is a thin robe that seems to be fashioned of opalescent silks and thin 
strands of gold wire, but nevertheless it is quite light. In fact, the <i>robe of the burning lands</i>
 is shockingly comfortable to wear. While worn, the robe protects the 
wearer from heat by granting her fire resistance 12. High temperatures 
hold no danger for someone wearing a <i>robe of the burning lands</i>. 
Additionally, the robe contains two deep pockets -- one on each hip. The
 left pocket can produce enough food for one person for one day, while 
the right is waterproof and can produce enough water for one person for 
three days (or for one day in hot climates such as a desert). Finally, a
 person wearing a <i>robe of the burning lands</i> always knows the direction of north from her current position. Determining the direction of north is a free action.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>create food and water, know direction</i>, <i>resist elements</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 29,500 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sand of the Ages: </b><i>Sand of the ages</i> 
shimmers and sparkles with a faint prismatic radiance. In truth, this 
sand consists of the pulverized fossils of ancient creatures. When a 
handful of this sand is poured upon the ground, it instantly transforms 
into an exceptionally strong and healthy dinosaur or dire animal. The 
creature immediately attacks any target indicated by its creator. If 
there are no targets to attack, it can be commanded to guard a 
particular area from intrusion. Once called up from the <i>sand of the ages</i>,
 the creature persists for 8 hours or until it is slain; once either of 
these conditions are met it crumbles into nonmagic sand.</p>
<p class="size2">There are three varieties of <i>sand of the ages</i>. Red <i>sand of the ages</i> summons a deinonychus or a dire ape. Golden <i>sand of the ages</i> summons a dire lion or a megaraptor. Black <i>sand of the ages</i>
 summons a dire tiger or a tyrannosaurus. Creatures summoned by sand of 
the ages gain a +4 enhancement bonus to their Strength and Constitution 
scores.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th (red), 9th (golden), 13th (black); <i>Prerequisites:</i><i>summon nature's ally III</i> (red), <i>summon nature's ally V</i> (golden), <i>summon nature's ally VII</i> (black), Craft Wondrous Item; <i>Market Price:</i> 1,500 gp (red), 4,500 gp (golden), or 9,100 gp (black); <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sand of Ruin:</b> The <i>sand of ruin</i> is a white
 sand with amazingly fine grains. It is carried in small pouches that 
can be thrown as grenade-like missiles with a range increment of 10 
feet. Upon striking a solid surface, the pouch bursts and the sand 
within fills a 10-foot-radius spread. All living creatures caught within
 this spread must make a Fortitude save (DC 22) or turn to stone. All 
constructs caught in the spread must make a Reflex save (DC 22) or 
suffer 15d6 points of damage as they suffer the effects of accelerated 
erosion; this damage penetrates any damage reduction. Those who succeed 
at the saving throw take half damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 15th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>disintegrate, flesh to stone</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 12,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> --.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scimitar of Stonestriking: </b>The powerful <i>scimitar of stonestriking</i>
 looks like it was carved entirely out of a single piece of granite. 
Despite this appearance, it is a dangerous weapon and functions as a <i>+3 keen scimitar</i>. The <i>scimitar of stonestriking</i>
 is particularly effective against creatures made of stone or earth 
(including stone golems, clay golems, and any creatures with the Earth 
subtype). Against such creatures, the scimitar does +2d6 points of 
additional damage on a successful hit and penetrates any damage 
reduction the creature may have. The scimitar's most terrible power, 
however, functions only against living creatures. If it scores a 
critical hit (which is a natural result of 15-20) on such a creature, 
the creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 19) or turn to 
stone. If the creature resists, it still suffers the critical damage. If
 a petrified creature is struck with a <i>scimitar of stonestriking</i>, the creature shatters into a thousand pieces and is slain.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Caster Level:</i> 11th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magical Arms and Armor, <i>flesh to stone</i>, <i>keen edge</i>, <i>shatter</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 138,315 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 4 lb.</p>
