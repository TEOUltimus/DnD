 Lost Coast has a reputation as a dangerous region not only because of 
its remote location and the powerful storms that scour it every winter,

presented here: the monstrous crab, the bloodthirsty razoreel swarms, 
and the horrifying brine naga.</p>

<p align="left"><i>This horrifying creature has the body of a sea snake,
 and the hues of its lithe shape form a dull rainbow of unhealthy 
colors. Thick clots of transparent slime cling to its body, and its head
 is a wretched half-snake and half-crone combination. Its forked tongue 
frequently slithers out from between its sharklike teeth to taste the 
air. The reek of brine accompanies the creature.</i></p>
<p align="left">Brine nagas are among the most dangerous of their kind. 
Their sheer power allows them to conjure large numbers of minions to 
serve them. They dwell in extensive sea caves and often make victims of 
sailors and pirates who sail off course and approach the secluded 
coastlines that brine nagas prefer to call home.</p>
<p align="left">Brine nagas speak Abyssal, Common, Infernal, and Sylvan.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">A brine naga starts combat by summoning several monsters
 or nature's allies to fight its enemies, emerging to attack with spells
 from a range of about 60 feet once its summoned minions have engaged 
with the enemy. Brine nagas have no fear of melee combat, though, and 
use their shimmering coils special attack to great effect in such 
situations.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial and secondary damage 3d6 Strength. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shimmering Coils (Su):</b> As long as a brine naga 
spends a move action to writhe and undulate her coils, all creatures 
within 60 feet must make a Will saving throw (DC 25) or become sickened 
(-2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, 
skill checks, and ability checks) for 1 round by the dance of unhealthy 
color. Creatures within 15 feet of the brine naga who fail this saving 
throw instead become nauseated for 1 round. Blind creatures are immune 
to this mind-affecting compulsion. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spells:</b> Brine nagas cast spells as 14th-level 
sorcerers and can also cast spells from the druid spell list. The druid 
spells are considered arcane spells for a brine naga. The naga can add 
druid spells to its personal spell list. The naga does not need a divine
 focus to cast these druid spells.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Typical Spells Known</i> (6/8/8/7/7/7/6/3; save DC 16 + spell level): 0 -- a<i>cid splash, dancing lights, daze, ghost sound, know direction, message, prestidigitation, resistance, touch of fatigue</i>; 1 -- <i>entangle, grease, longstrider, summon monster I, summon nature's ally I</i>; 2 -- <i>barkskin, glitterdust, summon monster II, summon nature's ally II, web</i>; 3 -- <i>greater magic fang, protection from energy, summon monster III, summon nature's ally III</i>; 4 -- <i>air walk, Evard's black tentacles, summon monster IV, summon nature's ally IV</i>; 5 -- <i>cone of cold, cure critical wounds, summon monster V</i>; 6 -- <i>acid fog, summon nature's ally VI</i>; 7 -- <i>summon monster VII</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Slime (Ex):</b> A brine naga's skin is covered with a
 thick layer of clear slime. The slime is slightly toxic, and any 
creature that attacks a brine naga with a natural weapon, unarmed 
attack, or a light melee weapon must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude 
save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This slime suffuses surrounding
 water, so when a brine naga is underwater, the slime also can affect 
all creatures within the brine naga's reach. Creatures that are immune 
to poison are immune to the effects of brine naga slime. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>

<p align="left"><i>This massive creature scuttles about with surprising 
speed and grace for its size. Its shell is brightly colored in shades of
 deep orange to bone white, and its twin claws are both sharp and large 
enough to behead a horse with one slice.</i></p>
<p align="left">Monstrous crabs are scavengers, and they feed upon the 
reeking bodies of dead sea creatures that wash up on shore. Despite 
this, they aren't above attacking still-living creatures upon sight, 
since monstrous crabs are always hungry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">A monstrous crab is straightforward in combat. It 
lumbers forth toward the nearest target and attacks with its claws. Once
 a monstrous crab has a morsel or creature in each claw, it retreats 
into the water to feed. Creatures held in its claws when it does so soon
 drown if they can't breathe water.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> With a successful grapple check, a monstrous crab can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 1d8+9 points of bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If a monstrous crab hits an 
opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a 
claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a
 free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it gets a 
hold, it also constricts on the same round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Powerful Claws (Ex):</b> A monstrous crab always 
applies 1.5 times its Strength modifier to damage inflicted with its 
claws. Additionally, it gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Vermin Traits:</b> A monstrous crab is immune to all 
mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and 
morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).</p>
<p align="left"><b><span class="size3red">Razoreel Swarm</span><br></b><b>Tiny Magical Beast (Aquatic, Swarm)</b><br><b>Hit Dice:</b> 18d10+54 (153 hp)<br><b>Initiative:</b> +14<br><b>Speed:</b> 10 ft.

<p align="left"><i>A shimmering cloud of red and silver, this swarm of 
foot-long eels swims with shocking grace and speed. Each eel possesses a
 set of razor-sharp transparent teeth and long thin serrated fins along 
its back.</i></p>
<p align="left">A razoreel swarm is a mass of writhing eels with a 
voracious appetite. Although they aren't amphibious, they can 
nevertheless slither about on land slowly for short periods of time. 
Their teeth and fins are sharp enough to cut through stone, and many 
razoreel swarms dwell in incredibly tangled nests burrowed directly into
 the solid rock that surrounds large tidepools.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">A razoreel swarm seeks to surround and attack any living
 creatures it encounters, and it pursues them for short distances onto 
shore if necessary. Some rocky beaches are particularly dangerous, for 
colonies of razoreels dig into the stone under the shore and create 
dangerous sections of weak stone that collapse when creatures walk over 
them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Constitution Damage (Ex):</b> Anyone damaged by a 
razoreel swarm must make a Fortitude save (DC 22) or take 1d6 points of 
temporary Constitution damage as well. This save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Distraction (Ex): </b>Any living creature that begins
 its turn with a razoreel swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 22 
Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Distraction (Ex):</b> Any living creature vulnerable 
to the swarm's damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is
 nauseated for 1 round; a DC 22 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even 
with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within 
the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell 
level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration requires a 
Concentration check (DC 20). The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Penetrate Damage Reduction (Su): </b>Razoreels are 
supernaturally sharp, and damage done by a razoreel swarm is treated as a
 magic weapon for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage
 reduction. This damage also ignores all hardness an object or creature 
may possess.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If a razoreel swarm makes a 
successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals 
half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swarm Traits:</b><i></i>A swarm has no clear front or
 back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits 
or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from 
slashing and piercing weapons.</p>
<p align="left">Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the 
swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade
 its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or 
reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, 
grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.</p>
<p align="left">A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>),
 with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an 
Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a -10 penalty on 
saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as 
many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack 
does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead. </p>
<p align="left">A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal 
damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and it does not re-form until
 its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>
