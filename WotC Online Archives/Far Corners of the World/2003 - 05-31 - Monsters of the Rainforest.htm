<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 one word can be used to describe a rainforest, that would be the word 
"alive." The rainforest is teeming with life, from the smallest ant that
 skitters across branches to the largest lumbering behemoth that plows 
through the forest with abandon. Many dangerous specimens lurk in the 
jungle, ranging from highly poisonous vermin to jaguars, but the true 
menaces of the deep rainforest are often as beautiful as they are deadly
 and strange. The verminvine is a unique plant that enslaves carpets of 
insects to serve as trained minions. Horrible undead creatures lurk in 
rainforests that have been plagued with hunters. And along the banks of 
rivers that wind through the deep jungle lurks the mysterious wharlysk, a
 creature that commands the very sounds of the jungle to its will.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Energy Drain (Su): </b>Any
 living creature struck for damage by a restless prey elephant gains one
 negative level. For each negative level bestowed, the restless prey 
elephant heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of healing is more than
 the damage the creature has suffered, it gains any excess as temporary 
hit points. If the negative level has not been removed (with a spell 
such as <i>restoration</i>) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted 
opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 16) to remove it. Failure 
means the opponent's level (or HD) is reduced by one.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Fear Aura (Su):</b> As a free action, a restless prey elephant can produce a fear effect. This ability functions exactly like a <i>fear</i>
 spell (caster level 11; save DC 16), except that it affects all 
creatures within a 15-foot radius around the restless prey elephant. Any
 creature that makes a successful saving throw against the effect cannot
 be affected again by that restless prey elephant's fear aura for one 
day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Preserved Hide:</b>
 A restless prey creature's natural armor toughens. In addition to its 
normal natural armor, it gains a bonus equal to the creature's Charisma 
modifier (minimum of +1; already figured into stats above).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Trample (Ex):</b>
 A restless prey elephant can trample Medium-size or smaller creatures, 
dealing 2d8+16 points of bludgeoning damage. Opponents who do not make 
attacks of opportunity against the restless prey elephant can attempt a 
Reflex save (DC 25) to halve the damage. Damage done is force damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Restless Prey Symbiosis (Su):</b>
 A restless prey elephant gains a +2 profane bonus to its Charisma score
 for each additional restless prey creature within 30 feet. This bonus 
persists as long as the creatures stay within 30 feet of each other.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Scent (Ex):</b> A restless prey elephant can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Undead Traits:</b> A restless prey elephant is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep,</i>
 paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and 
any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on 
objects. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability 
damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A 
restless prey elephant cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if 
it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2005-31%20-%20Monsters%20of%20the%20Rainforest_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">The Restless Prey Creature Template</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Poachers
 and hunters are naturally drawn to certain creatures whose body parts 
are valued as trophies. Unfortunately, beasts that are slain by hunters 
sometimes rise as undead monsters cursed to forever stalk those who 
inflicted such a distasteful end upon them. Restless prey creatures are 
filled with a burning hatred for all life, and their unholy energies 
gift them with intelligence far above that normally possessed by living 
creatures of the same type. Many restless prey creatures seek out the 
hunter who killed them to return the favor, but success in this endeavor
 does not bring release for the undead monster. Such creatures often 
remain to haunt the areas of their death or the homes of their victims.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Creating a Restless Prey Creature</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Restless
 prey" is a template that can be applied to any animal, vermin, or 
beast. The restless prey creature's type changes to undead. It uses all 
the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted 
here.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Hit Dice:</b> Hit Die type changes to d12.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Speed:</b>
 A restless prey creature moves at twice the speed of the original 
creature. A restless prey creature with flight has average 
maneuverability.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Attacks:</b>
 Although a restless prey creature has suffered from the brutal excision
 of its natural attacks, in its new form it has regrown these attacks as
 extensions of its once living body. A restless prey creature's natural 
attacks are composed of pure force and remain the same as those of the 
base creature, except that they are force attacks and they ignore armor,
 natural armor, and shield bonus, as touch attacks do. A restless prey 
creature's force attacks are not subject to damage reduction.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Damage:</b>
 A restless prey creature's natural attacks deal force damage in the 
same amount of damage as the original creature's attacks, except that 
they gain a damage bonus equal to the creature's Charisma modifier 
(minimum +1). This bonus damage stacks with bonus damage from high 
Strength.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Special Attacks:</b>
 A restless prey creature retains the base creature's extraordinary 
abilities. In addition, it gains the following two special attacks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Energy Drain (Su):</i><b></b>Any
 living creature that takes damage from a restless prey creature's 
attack gains one negative level. For each negative level bestowed, the 
restless prey creature heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of 
healing is more than the damage the creature has suffered, it gains any 
excess as temporary hit points. If the negative level has not been 
removed (with a spell such as <i>restoration</i>) before 24 hours have 
passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 +
 half the restless prey creature's Hit Dice + Charisma modifier) to 
remove it. Failure means the opponent's level (or HD) is reduced by one.
 </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Fear Aura (Su):</i> As a free action, a restless prey creature can produce a fear effect. This ability functions exactly like a <i>fear</i>
 spell (caster level equals the restless prey creature's Hit Dice; save 
DC 10 + half the restless prey creature's Hit Dice + Charisma modifier),
 except that it affects all creatures within a 15-foot radius around the
 restless prey creature. Any creature that makes a successful saving 
throw against the effect cannot be affected again by that restless prey 
creature's fear aura for one day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Special Qualities:</b>
 A restless prey creature gains all the traits normally possessed by 
creatures of the undead type. In addition, they gain the following 
special qualities as well.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Damage Reduction:</i> A restless prey creature gains damage reduction 20/+2.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Preserved Hide:</i>
 A restless prey creature's natural armor toughens. In addition to its 
normal natural armor, it gains a bonus equal to the creature's Charisma 
modifier (minimum of +1).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Restless Prey Symbiosis (Su):</i>
 A restless prey creature gains a +2 profane bonus to its Charisma score
 for each additional restless prey creature within 30 feet. This bonus 
persists as long as the creatures stay within 30 feet of each other. 
Additional profane bonuses to Charisma scores from additional creatures 
within 30 feet stack with each other. For example, each member of a 
group of 3 restless prey rhinoceroses gain a total +4 profane bonus to 
their individual Charisma scores, as long as all three remain within 30 
feet of each other.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Abilities:</b> A restless prey creature gains +6 to its Intelligence and Charisma scores, but being undead, it has no Constitution score.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skills:</b>
 Restless prey creatures receive a +8 racial bonus to Hide, Listen, Move
 Silently, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Feats:</b> Restless prey creatures gain 1 feat for every 4 Hit Dice (minimum of 1 feat).</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Climate/Terrain:</b> As base creature</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Organization:</b> Solitary or pack (2-10 restless prey creatures)</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Challenge Rating:</b> Same as base creature +2</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Treasure:</b> None</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Alignment:</b> Always chaotic evil</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Advancement:</b> As base creature.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 verminvine is a strange tropical plant that uses swarms of poisonous 
and carnivorous insects to gather nutrients and to defend itself.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 typical verminvine consists of a large mass of dark green foliage that 
grows on the base of a tree trunk or hangs from a tree's lowest limbs 
like sheets of thick moss. Large round leaves are tangled into this 
mossy mass, and the whole plant constantly sweats a runny red liquid 
that smells of fermenting fruit. Growing from the center of the mass is a
 long, fibrous, brown vine that can whip about like a tentacle when the 
plant is attacking.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Locals
 quickly learn to avoid places that smell of fermenting fruit in the 
jungle, for these regions are often the haunt of large patches of 
verminvine. The fluids the plant constantly weeps attract swarms of 
insects from the surrounding regions, which swarm all over the plant and
 drink the fluid. In so doing, the insects become little more than 
slaves of the verminvine and can be directed by the plant to attack its 
prey.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Verminvines
 cannot speak, but they understand and recognize simple words in the 
predominant local language and use knowledge gained in this manner to 
aid in securing food.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Combat</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 verminvine lashes out at any creature that passes near it with its 
single vine, attempting to hold a creature motionless while its enslaved
 swarm of vermin kill it. The dead body is then allowed to drop over the
 mass of the plant, where the thick round leaves slowly absorb nutrients
 from the decomposing flesh. If faced with creatures that use reach or 
ranged attacks, the verminvine retaliates with its insect plague ability
 and tries to force such enemies within reach of its main attack.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b>
 If a verminvine hits an opponent that is at least one size category 
smaller than itself with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and 
attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
 of opportunity (grapple bonus +11). If it gets a hold, it also 
constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the verminvine has the option 
to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its vine tentacle to hold
 the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the verminvine is not 
considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it 
makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam damage. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> With a successful grapple check, a verminvine can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 1d8+6 points of bludgeoning damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Insect Plague (Su):</b>
 As a full round action, the verminvine can direct its attending swarm 
of vermin to form a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects. This
 horde forms a cloud of vermin that acts differently than the normal 
attending vineswarm. First of all, it fills four 5-foot squares; the 
verminvine can shape the cloud into whatever continuous shape it wishes.
 The cloud can travel at a speed of 10 feet in any direction (not all of
 the vermin the swarm can fly, even though a fair portion of the cloud 
may be made of flying insects), to a limit of 60 feet from the 
originating verminvine. The cloud returns to the originating verminvine 
at top speed by the shortest possible route once the latter stops 
controlling it. This cloud blocks vision, and spellcasting within the 
cloud is impossible. Each creature inside the cloud takes 1 point of 
damage at the end of each round spent within it from the bites and 
stings. Invisibility offers no protection against this effect. In 
addition, every creature within the cloud must make a Will save (DC 12) 
each round or flee at its fastest possible speed in a random direction 
from the cloud; this is an extraordinary fear effect. Heavy smoke drives
 off the insects, as does fire or high wind. A single torch is 
ineffective against the insect plague, but any magical fire effect or 
nonmagical fire of at least Medium-size can disperse the cloud. If the 
plague is dispersed, it retreats to the verminvine.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Plant Traits (Ex):</b> A verminvine is immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>,
 paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to critical 
hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature also has low-light vision.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tremorsense (Ex):</b> A verminvine can automatically sense the location of any creature or object within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Verminbond (Ex):</b>
 The odor exuded by a verminvine causes all creatures of the vermin type
 to interpret the plant as an ally. Any vermin that comes within 15 feet
 of the verminvine must make a Will save (DC 12) or become attracted to 
the plant and remain in the immediate area for 1d3 hours before moving 
on. Each time a verminvine is encountered, there is a 50% chance that it
 is attended by 1d4 Medium-size vermin (usually giant ants). These 
vermin are present in addition to the vineswarm, though they act as 
individual creatures and should be accounted for as such in the 
encounter.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Vineswarm (Su):</b>
 The verminvine is constantly surrounded by swarms of biting and 
stinging insects. Any creature that occupies a square that is threatened
 by the verminvine is attacked by this swarm, even when the verminvine 
itself cannot attack or threaten targets. Once a swarm is dispersed, it 
takes the verminvine 1 hour to attract a new swarm. See the vineswarm 
below for more information about a sample swarm.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The vineswarm gathers due to the will of the verminvine (see above).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Combat</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 vineswarm attacks to defend the verminvine or to assist the verminvine 
in gaining the nutrients it requires. See the verminvine for more about 
the vineswarm.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Swarm Traits:</b><i></i>A
 swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is 
not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm composed of Fine 
creatures is immune to all weapon damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Reducing
 a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm to break up, though 
damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or 
resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by
 damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and 
they cannot grapple another.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>),
 with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an 
Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a -10 penalty on 
saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as 
many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack 
does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a <i>gust of wind</i>
 spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, 
treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent 
creatures. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of subdual damage to the swarm 
per spell level (or Hit Die of the originating creature, in the case of 
effects such as an air elemental's whirlwind).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 swarm rendered unconscious by means of subdual damage becomes 
disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points 
exceed its subdual damage.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 creature in the swarm who takes no actions other than fighting the 
swarm off takes 1 point of damage on its turn. A creature in the swarm 
who takes any other action, including leaving the swarm, takes 1d4 
points of damage (as noted above).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Distraction (Ex):</b>
 Any living creature vulnerable to the swarm's damage that begins its 
turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 13 
Fortitude save negates the effect. Even with a successful save, 
spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm 
requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills 
requiring patience and concentration requires a Concentration check (DC 
20). The save DC is Constitution-based.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Vermin Traits: </b>A
 vineswarm is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
 phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It also has darkvision 
(60-foot range).</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 semireptilian wharlysk lurks deep in the hearts of particularly moist 
jungles, often near rivers, where it uses its mastery over sound to 
capture prey.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 wharlysk's head combines the worst aspects of a warthog's and a 
viper's, down to the razor-sharp tusks and the forked tongue. It has a 
long, powerful neck attached to a bulbous, newtlike body, and a single 
row of six long tentacles tipped with scorpionlike pinchers writhe down 
the length of its striped back. The wharlysk's skin is always slimy, and
 its six legs end in powerful webbed feat armed with sharp claws to aid 
in climbs through the canopy above, when it can find trees large enough 
to support its weight.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Although
 fairly intelligent, wharlysks have little interest in forming societies
 with others of their kind. They do adore adulation and worship, and 
they often subjugate nearby intelligent races and force them to attend 
its debased needs and to gather food and treasure for it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 wharlysk is usually about 25 feet long, but it coils up on itself when 
in combat. The standard wharlysk weighs nearly 18,000 lbs.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wharlysks speak Draconic, but they can use <i>tongues</i> as a spell-like ability at will.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Combat</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 wharlysk prefers to engage enemies from hiding, using its spell-like 
abilities to keep them from closing to melee range as a group so it can 
pick off its enemies one at a time with its bite or breath weapon. When 
fighting multiple creatures in melee, it always uses its Expertise feat 
to gain the maximum increase to its Armor Class (+5), and it often uses 
half its claw attacks to trip or disarm opponents they perceive as 
particularly dangerous. The creature is almost fearless, except when 
confronted by enemies that use electricity attacks. A wharlysk often 
flees before such attacks if its enemies look to be well organized and 
powerful, but it won't let the victors rest long before tracking them 
down and extracting vengeance for the previous humiliation.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once every 1d4 rounds, a wharlysk can emit a blast of sound from its 
maw in a 60-foot-long cone. Every creature caught in this area takes 
10d6 points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 27 half). A creature that fails 
to save is also nauseated by the sound for 1d4 rounds.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>ghost sound, message, shatter, silence, sound burst, tongues, ventriloquism;</i> 3/day -- <i>shout.</i> Caster level 20th; save DC 13 + spell level.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Control Sound (Su):</b>
 A wharlysk is in constant control of all sound it can hear within 120 
feet. This ability serves two functions. First, the wharlysk may use <i>sculpt sound </i>(as
 the bard spell of the same name) at will as a standard action. It can 
sculpt up to three different sounds simultaneously. A creature targeted 
by this ability may resist with a successful Will save (DC 26). Second, 
whenever the wharlysk is subjected to a sonic attack (other than its own
 breath weapon or that of another wharlysk), it absorbs the energy and 
can instantly redirect it as a ranged touch attack (+11 on attack rolls)
 against any one target within 120 feet. A successful hit inflicts the 
same amount of sonic damage on the target that would have normally been 
inflicted on the Wharlysk.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> A wharlysk takes normal damage from electricity.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Skills:</b> *In forested regions, the wharlysk's natural coloration grants it a +16 competence bonus on all Hide checks.</span></p>
