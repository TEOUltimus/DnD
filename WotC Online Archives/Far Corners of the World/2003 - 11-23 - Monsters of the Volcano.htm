 they are one of the most destructive regions in the far corners of the 
world, volcanoes are far from lifeless wastelands. In fact, many 
creatures thrive on the barren slopes and boiling cauldrons of these 
locations. Fire giants, red dragons, thoqquas, azers, magma mephitis, 
and magmins are some of the more infamous denizens of these regions, but
 here visitors can find other creatures that rarely leave their fiery 
homelands that are just as dangerous.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This plant has a thick tangle of black thorny fronds 
growing from a central bulbous mass. A single short stalk emerges from 
the center of this mass, ending in a large black flower that glows a 
faint red.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Lavabriars grow on the lower slopes of volcanoes, along 
active faultlines, or anywhere that pockets of magma are trapped near 
the surface of the world. The hardy plants thrive in regions where the 
sun is often blocked out by clouds of ash in the sky, and they actually 
draw their nourishment from the lava pockets below via a network of 
heat-resistant roots. If volcanic activity in an area subsides, the 
lavabriars can creep off to a new area, but they usually remain immobile
 when not in combat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The lavabriar is an unintelligent plant, and unlike many
 other dangerous plant creatures, it does not prey on living flesh. It 
is nevertheless a dangerous creature, for it has developed a highly 
effective way to defend itself. When the plant senses intruders, it 
lashes out with its tendrils and sprays lava at anything it perceives as
 a threat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lava Spurt (Ex):</b> Once per minute, a lavabriar can
 expel a gout of lava from its flower. The lavabriar makes a ranged 
touch attack (attack bonus +4) against any target within 60 feet. A 
successful hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage, and those hit take an 
additional 1d6 points of automatic fire damage on the next round unless 
the lava is scraped off (a full-round action).</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>What at first appeared to be a fast-moving cloud of 
volcanic ash resolves into something far more terrible. Thousands of 
burning bodies and blackened skeletons tumble and roil in the cloud. 
Periodically, huge tentacles formed of ash and bodies emerge from the 
cloud to swipe away buildings and great swaths of trees. The unliving 
bodies emit a constant thunderous scream, as if a volcano had learned to
 wail in agony from the fire in its core.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The necroclasm is one of the largest forms of undead; 
fortunately, they are limited in range to the volcano that spawned them.
 A necroclasm forms when a large group of evil creatures are destroyed 
by a volcanic eruption. Typically, a city of evil-doers founded on the 
slopes of what was assumed to be a dormant volcano form the building 
blocks of a new necroclasm. The creature itself is, in some ways, 
similar to a swarm of burning undead bodies, although the creature 
displays few of the actual qualities of the swarm subtype.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Necroclasms possess some intelligence, but they have 
little interest in turning their evil outward into surrounding regions. 
They prefer to haunt a forty to sixty mile radius about the base of 
their parent volcano, and they constantly scour the landscape for living
 creatures to eradicate and absorb into their mass. A necroclasm must 
retreat to the cauldron of its parent volcano during the night; unlike 
most undead, these creatures are active only during the day. They retain
 their abilities and mobility at all times within the volcano itself, 
but they cannot physically move beyond the rim of its caldera until 
sunrise.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Necroclasms gain a deflection bonus to their AC equal to
 their Charisma bonus. Additionally, during the day they gain a +4 
profane bonus to their AC.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A necroclasm's preferred mode of attack is to simply 
charge into the midst of its enemies and become surrounded, after which 
it uses whirlwind attack to punish all creatures within reach. It 
usually saves its incineration ability for particularly dangerous 
creatures, or against targets quick and canny enough to remain out of 
reach of its melee attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fiery Aura (Su):</b> The air around a necroclasm is 
heated to abysmal temperatures by the undead creature's burning body. 
All creatures within 30 feet of a necroclasm suffer 6d6 points of fire 
damage per round (no saving throw). This is continuous damage for 
purposes of disrupting spellcasting.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Incineration (Su):</b> As a full-round action, a 
necroclasm can emit a line of white-hot ash to a range of 120 feet. All 
creatures affected by this line suffer 20d6 points of fire damage; a 
successful Reflex save (DC 38) halves the damage done. A creature slain 
by this damage is reduced to ashes and immediately drawn into the 
necroclasm's body, healing the necroclasm an amount of damage equal to 
that creature's normal maximum hit point total. The save DC is 
Charisma-based. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Thunderous Roar (Su):</b> A necroclasm constantly 
emits a thunderous roar of rage, despair, and fear as the thousands of 
damned souls that constitute its body are forced to constantly relive 
the terror of their volcanic death. This roar drowns out all 
conversation within 60 feet of the necroclasm, deafening all creatures 
for as long as they remain in the area. Additionally, all creatures in 
this area must make a successful Will saving throw (DC 40) or become 
shaken for as long as they remain in the area. A successful save makes a
 creature immune to the necroclasm's thunderous roar for one day. 
Thunderous roar is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is 
Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Undead Traits:</b> A necroclasm is immune to 
mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability 
scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from 
massive damage. It cannot be <i>raised</i>, and <i>resurrection</i> works only if it is willing. Darkvision 60 ft.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This creature looks like a mass of obsidian with its 
edges polished and smooth. Yet when it moves, it gives the impression of
 a mobile snake made of glistening tar, with numerous razor-sharp lances
 of flexible obsidian writhing chaotically out of its mass.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">An obsidian ooze is a dangerous predator that lurks in 
lava tubes and other underground chambers near volcanic regions. The 
creature can burrow through solid rock with ease by melting its way 
through the ground; the tunnels formed remain stable for several days 
and resemble perfectly round lava tubes in shape. Obsidian oozes feed on
 the ash of organic matter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A typical obsidian ooze resembles a 3-foot-wide, 
14-foot-long snake. It weighs 35,000 pounds. They usually split into two
 to three smaller oozes upon growing to 36 Hit Dice, although rumors of 
colossal obsidian oozes that live in the heart of active volcanoes 
persist.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">An obsidian ooze coils like a snake when it locates prey
 but it does not strike when it attacks. Rather, it grows long lances of
 razor-sharp but flexible obsidian spines with shocking speed, skewers 
creatures in range, and then flows up these spines to engulf captured 
prey.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Engulf (Ex):</b> As a standard action, an obsidian 
ooze can engulf any creature that it is currently grappling or being 
grappled by it. Once a creature is engulfed, the creature takes 4d6 
points of fire damage per round from the ooze's molten interior. An 
engulfed creature can try to pound its way out with any natural or light
 bludgeoning weapons. Dealing a total of at least 30 points of damage to
 the interior of the ooze (AC 15) in this way creates an opening large 
enough to permit escape, but causes the molten interior to spill out in a
 5-foot radius. All creatures in this range take 2d6 points of fire 
damage, or half on a successful Reflex save (DC 21). Once a single 
engulfed creature exits, the hole quickly hardens over; thus, another 
engulfed opponent must pound its own way out. An obsidian ooze can hold 2
 Medium or 8 Small or smaller opponents. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If an obsidian ooze hits an 
opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a 
spine attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a
 free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sharp Spines (Ex):</b> An obsidian ooze's spines have
 a critical threat range of 18-20, which the creature's Improved 
Critical feat increases to 15-20. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Molten Core (Ex):</b> Piercing and slashing weapons 
deal no damage on a successful hit to an obsidian ooze, but they do have
 a chance of being damaged by the creature. Any weapon that inflicts 
damage to an obsidian ooze must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 21) or 
take 4d6 points of fire damage. If the weapon was a natural weapon, the 
attacking creature suffers this damage. The save DC is 
Constitution-based. Worse, the attack causes the creature's lava-like 
core to spray out in a gout. The attacking creature takes 2d6 points of 
fire damage, or half on a successful Reflex save (DC 21). The save DC is
 Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ooze Traits: </b>An obsidian ooze is blind 
(blindsight 60 ft.) and immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, 
illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. It is immune to 
poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, and <i>polymorphing</i>. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>
