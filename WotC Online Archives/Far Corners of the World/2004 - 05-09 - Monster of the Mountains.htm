 dangerous creatures lurk in the remote mountains of the world. This 
terrain favors creatures that can move with ease across vertical 
surfaces or that can climb or fly. This month, we look at three such 
denizens: the ravenous cliff raptor, the mysterious glitterhaunt, and 
the noxious and equally dangerous uloriax.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><span class="size3red">Cliff Raptor</span><br> Medium Animal<br></b><b>Hit Dice:</b> 4d8+12 (30 hp)<br><b>Initiative: </b>+3<br><b>Speed:</b> 60 ft.

<p align="LEFT"><i>The creature looks like a long-legged lizard, save 
that it sports fairly brilliant plumage on its back and long thin tail. 
Each of its two hind feet are armed with a prodigiously oversized talon 
that almost overshadows its sharp teeth and razor-sharp claws in terms 
of intimidating natural weapons.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A cliff raptor is a form of velociraptor that has 
adapted to a life on the sheer mountain faces of rugged badlands and 
cliffs. They skitter along the faces of these cliffs with shocking and 
almost terrifying ease. Cliff raptors hunt in packs, like wolves, and 
have little fear of humanoids.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A cliff raptor makes an excellent animal companion for 
characters from mountainous regions. A druid of 7th level or higher can 
take a cliff raptor as an animal companion.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Cliff raptors prefer to begin combat with their leap, 
and they jump down upon their prey from above. If the victim of such a 
leap survives the next few rounds of combat, the raptor usually tries to
 clamber up above and leap down again to finish the prey off.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Leap (Ex):</b> A cliff raptor that drops at least 10 
feet before making an attack against a target gains a +2 bonus on attack
 rolls with its talons. If it hits, it deals an additional 2d6 points of
 damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Surefooted (Ex):</b> The cliff raptor is especially 
surefooted, and it always lands upright and on its feet after taking a 
fall. Additionally, cliff raptors treat any fall as being 20 feet 
shorter than the actual height fallen for the purposes of determining 
falling damage. A cliff raptor gains a +4 racial bonus to resist being 
bull-rushed or tripped.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills: </b>Cliff raptors gain a +8 racial bonus on 
all Balance and Tumble checks. They gain a +16 racial bonus (+8 for 
having a climb speed plus an extra +8 bonus) on all Climb checks. In 
addition, they can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if 
rushed or threatened.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><span class="size3red">Glitterhaunt</span><br> Medium Fey (Earth)<br></b><b>Hit Dice:</b> 12d6+60 (102 hp)<br><b>Initiative: </b>+3<br><b>Speed:</b> 30 ft.

<p align="LEFT"><i>It rises up out of the stony ground. Its overall 
shape is humanoid, except its skin appears to shimmer, almost as if 
quicksilver dusted with a layer of sparkling powder undulated gently. 
Its eyes are large for its face, and they glisten like molten emerald. 
Tiny shards of multicolored crystals protrude from its body at random 
places and at random intervals. The creature glows with light of many 
hues.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A glitterhaunt is a seldom-encountered spirit of the 
gemstone lode -- a physical embodiment of the beauty and mystery of all 
that glitters. They prefer to cavort and play along veins of gemstones 
hidden deep in the mountains, but where these crystal veins are exposed 
to the surface (often in mines), they sometimes gather to protect the 
crystals from those who would take them. Glitterhaunts often come into 
conflict with miners -- dwarves and gnomes in particular.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A glitterhaunt is about the height and weight of a human. It speaks Common, Sylvan, and Terran.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A glitterhaunt attacks by forming long, thin crystalline
 spines from its body with sudden and powerful force. As a full attack 
action, a glitterhaunt can strike with four of these gemlances; a 
successful critical hit with a gemlance inflicts x4 damage. Against more
 powerful foes, a glitterhaunt prefers to use its spells or special 
attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Prismatic Flash (Su): </b>Once per day, as a standard action, a glitterhaunt can create a flash of multicolored energy that duplicates the effects of a <i>prismatic spray</i>.
 All creatures in a 20-foot burst centered on the glitterhaunt are 
affected. Saving throws, when applicable, are DC 21; this save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shardburst (Su):</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, a 
glitterhaunt can generate a lacerating spray of jagged, razor-sharp 
crystals from its body. The crystals explode in a 40-foot burst around 
the glitterhaunt, dealing 6d6 points of slashing damage to all creatures
 in the area. A successful Reflex save (DC 21) halves the damage done. 
The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Absorb Metal (Su):</b> As a free action once a round,
 a glitterhaunt can absorb forged metal into its body to heal damage. 
The glitterhaunt can either make a touch attack to absorb metal or it 
can attune its body to absorb the first forged metal weapon that strikes
 its body. In the latter case, the effect lasts until the beginning of 
the glitterhaunt's next turn, or until it is discharged. In either case 
the object takes 4d6 points of sonic damage. If the object is destroyed,
 it shatters into thousands of pieces that immediately melt and merge 
with the glitterhaunt, restoring damage equal to the object's maximum 
hit points. The glitterhaunt can use this ability only once per round, 
and it cannot affect an object that weighs more than 10 pounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Earth Glide (Ex):</b> A glitterhaunt can glide 
through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth -- including 
metal -- as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves 
behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs 
of its presence. A <i>move earth</i> spell cast on an area containing a 
burrowing glitterhaunt flings the fey back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 
round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><span class="size3red">Uloriax</span><br> Gargantuan Plant<br></b><b>Hit Dice:</b> 23d8+184 (287 hp)<br><b>Initiative: </b>+1<br><b>Speed:</b> 20 ft.

<p align="LEFT"><i>This massive plantlike creature has a rubbery, almost
 spherical body that trundles across the mountainside, resembling a 
massive toadstool that has learned to walk on a dozen long spines. 
Suddenly, its back inflates with a thunderous boom, and the creature 
lifts off the face of the mountain and into the air with shocking grace.
 Trailing below it are four long, thin, brown tendrils, and three thick 
branches. The tendrils end in a tiny handlike shape, while the branches 
end in massive jaws.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Several sages believe that powerful and insane druids 
created the first Uloriaxes ages ago. Although alien and strange in 
shape, a uloriax is in fact a rather intelligent creature. They have 
little interest in society or civilization, but they sometimes drift 
down into the foothills to raid settlements to add to their collection 
of magic. Uloriaxes seem to enjoy these raids as much as the plunder; 
sometimes they return to finish of the slaughter of a village once they 
have mastered the use of any stolen magic wands and items.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Uloriaxes have numerous mouthlike openings hidden along 
its body through which they can converse. Their voices are loud and 
earthshaking, as if a thundercloud had learned to speak. They fly 
through the air by the generation of prodigious amounts of buoyant 
gasses that are then vented from these openings to provide propulsion.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The uloriax speaks Common, Auran, and Druidic.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">An uloriax prefers to use its spell-like abilities to 
assault targets from afar before swooping in for the kill. In combat, it
 utilizes any wands it owns and attacks with its three stalked maws. 
Against particularly troublesome opponents, an uloriax uses its Snatch 
feat, then lifts up into the air to drop its foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> 60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 12d6 sonic, Reflex DC 29 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): </b>At will -- <i>fog cloud, gust of wind</i> (DC 15), <i>wind wall</i>; 3/day -- <i>control weather, control winds </i>(DC 18), <i>lightning bolt</i> (DC 16), <i>whirlwind</i> (DC 21); 1/day -- <i>call lightning storm</i> (DC 18), <i>reverse gravity</i> (DC 20), <i>storm of vengeance</i> (DC 22). Caster level 23rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Regeneration (Ex): </b>Cold and fire deal lethal damage to an uloriax.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wand Mastery (Su):</b> The uloriax can use wands and 
other spell trigger items as if it had access to the druid spell list. 
Additionally, it can wield a wand in each of its four tendrils, and it 
can activate each wand simultaneously as a free action, up to once per 
round per wand. The uloriax can activate up to four wands per round in 
this manner.</p>
