<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 the frozen lands, magic items are often used to protect the user from 
the ravages of the environment. Explorers and adventurers who seek to 
travel in such dangerous climates all seek items such as the <i>boots of the winterlands</i>, the <i>cube of frost resistance</i>, and <i>rings of cold resistance</i>.
 Other items are bonded to the frozen lands, though; rare and precious 
items crafted by secretive frost giant sorcerers, arctic druids, clerics
 of icy deities, and even ancient white dragons. These items embody the 
strength and power of the frozen lands, and the lure of their capture 
has brought about the frozen doom of many adventuring parties in the 
past.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crystal Tear (Minor Artifact): </b>Legends
 in the frozen lands tell stories of a deity who suffered some great 
personal tragedy in the ancient past. The exact nature of this deity 
changes from region to region, but they all agree on one thing. The 
tears shed by this unknown deity fell to the ground and became frozen, 
and some of the deity's divine power and emotions became frozen along 
with them.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A <i>crystal tear</i>
 looks like a large tear made of ice with flashes of light sparkling in 
its depths. These are potent minor artifacts; their presence constantly 
exudes a strong <i>emotion</i> spell effect (as a 20th-level caster) in 
an emanation with a 15-foot radius. As a free action, the holder of the 
tear can choose which of the spell's six effects (despair, fear, 
friendship, hate, hope, or rage) the tear produces. Once an effect is 
chosen, it operates until the holder changes it. The tear continues to 
emanate the last emotion the holder chose if the holder puts down the 
tear.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Living
 creatures in the emanation can attempt Will saves (DC 16) to avoid the 
emanation's effects. Those who fail suffer whatever effect the tear is 
currently producing for as long as they remain within the radius of the 
emanation and for 1 minute after leaving. Those who successfully save 
cannot be affected by the tear's current emanation for 1 minute (but 
must save again if the holder changes the effect.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 holder of the tear finds that his own emotions are completely "drowned 
out" by the presence of the tear; this effectively keeps the user from 
experiencing any emotions at all but also has the fortunate side effect 
of rendering him completely immune to mind-affecting spells and 
spell-like effects.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Overlapping areas of effect from multiple <i>crystal tears</i> do not stack if they generate identical emotions.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Crystal tears</i>
 do not melt if brought to warmer climates or if exposed to heat or 
flame; they always retain a cool temperature regardless of their 
environs. Despite this, the owner of a <i>crystal tear</i> can cause the
 tear to melt into liquid by targeting it with a spell that is at least 
5th level and carries the fire descriptor. The spell cast is absorbed 
completely by the tear, which then melts immediately and evaporates in 
2d4 rounds. If the melted tear is imbibed before it evaporates, it 
grants a +4 inherent bonus to one of the drinker's ability scores. The 
exact score to which the bonus is applied is determined randomly, 
although it does not apply to a score that already possesses an inherent
 bonus. If all of the drinker's scores already possess an inherent 
bonus, the +4 inherent bonus applies to the score with the lowest bonus.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level</i>: 20th; <i>Weight</i> 4 lb.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gauntlets of Frost:</b><i>Gauntlets of frost</i>
 are made of a pale blue metal and are adorned with light blue runes. 
The plates that make up the gauntlets always seem to be caked with frost
 and ice. The wearer of <i>gauntlets of frost</i> can use them to create a <i>ray of frost</i> at will as a standard action.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Three
 times a day, the user may imbue any melee weapon held in her hand with 
the frost weapon special ability as a standard action; this causes the 
weapon to do an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful 
hit. The weapon retains this quality for 5 rounds.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level</i>: 5th; <i>Prerequisites</i>: Craft Wondrous Item, <i>chill metal, ray of frost</i>; <i>Market Price</i>: 7,800 gp; <i>Weight</i>: 2 lb.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Icemail Armor:</b> A suit of <i>icemail armor</i> appears to be a suit of transparent breastplate armor carved out of ice. Although it feels cold to the touch, <i>icemail armor</i> keeps the wearer warm and protected from cold, granting cold resistance 30. <i>Icemail armor </i>is much lighter than steel, and although it provides protection equal to that afforded by a suit of <i>+3 breastplate </i>armor,
 it is considered to be light armor. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus to
 Armor Class of +5, an armor check penalty of -1, and an arcane spell 
failure chance of 15%. The arcane spell failure chance for casting 
spells with the cold descriptor drops to 0%, and the save DCs to resist 
these spells increases by +2.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Druids can wear <i>icemail armor</i> without violating their druidic vows, as long as they hail from an arctic climate.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level</i>: 9th; <i>Prerequisites</i>: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Spell Focus (evocation), <i>chill metal</i>, <i>protection from elements</i>; <i>Market Price</i>: 52,000 gp; <i>Weight</i>: 15 lb.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Icicle Rod:</b> An <i>icicle rod</i>
 looks like nothing more than a 3-foot-long icicle. The rod remains cold
 to the touch at all times but never melts. While it is held, the 
wielder gains cold resistance 30. It may be wielded in melee as a <i>+1 frost short sword.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 wielder may fire a small icicle from it as a standard action. This 
icicle has a maximum range of 1,000 feet, and attacks made with it are 
resolved as ranged touch attacks that do 2d4 points of cold damage on a 
hit. Once it hits, the icicle quickly begins to spread frost and ice 
over the target, doing an additional 2d4 points of cold damage each 
round for a total of 5 additional rounds after the initial hit. This 
power may be used three times a day.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As a standard action, you may point the <i>icicle rod</i>
 at a single target within 250 feet and encase the target in sheets of 
ice. The victim gains a Reflex save (DC 15) to negate this effect. 
Failure indicates the victim's limbs are encased in ice, rendering him 
immobile. A winged creature affected by this power while it is flying 
falls to the ground. The ice grants the victim one-half cover (+4 cover 
bonus to AC, +2 cover bonus on Reflex saves), but its extreme cold 
causes 1d6 points of cold damage per round. The ice persists for 7 
rounds, unless it is destroyed. Creatures other than the victim can 
attack the ice; it has 20 hit points and suffers double damage from fire
 attacks but is immune to cold attacks. Its break DC is 26, and the 
Escape Artist DC to wriggle out of it is 30. This power may be used 
twice per day.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finally, once a day the wielder of an <i>icicle rod</i> can generate a maximized <i>ice storm</i> as a standard action.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level</i>: 5th; <i>Prerequisites</i>: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, Maximize Spell, <i>ice storm</i>, <i>protection from elements, wall of ice</i>; <i>Market Price</i>: 121,000 gp.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ring of the White Wyrm: </b>The <i>ring of the white wyrm</i> is fashioned from the tooth of a great wyrm white dragon. The ring can perform the following functions on command: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Icewalking</i> at will (as <i>spider climb</i>, but the surfaces the wearer climbs must be icy)</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Freezing fog</i> 2/day (as <i>solid fog</i>, but the effect also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog touches, creating the effect of a <i>grease</i> spell. The wearer of the ring is immune to the <i>grease</i> effect because of the <i>icewalking</i> power it imparts).</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Wall of ice</i> 1/day </span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 addition, the wearer gains the ability to speak and understand the 
Draconic language as long as the ring is worn and grants the wearer cold
 resistance 15.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 primary function of the ring, however, is to infuse the wearer with the
 energies and power of the dragon. Once per day, the wearer may call 
upon the ring to transform her into a half-dragon. This is a full-round 
action that provokes an attack of opportunity, and the transformation 
lasts for an hour. While transformed, the wearer gains the following 
benefits: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">+4 natural armor bonus to AC</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bite and claw attacks as a half-dragon of the same size as the wearer</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Breath weapon usable once per transformation (cone of cold, 30 ft. long, 3d6 cold damage, Reflex save DC 16)</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Immunity to cold damage</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">+8
 Strength, +2 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma. These bonuses 
are considered racial bonuses and stack with other racial bonuses the 
wearer may have. </span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ring's transformation power also changes the wearer's appearance into a
 draconic form. The wearer's general shape and size does not change, 
although her equipment is altered in shape so it can still be utilized. 
Unlike <i>polymorph self</i>, the user's equipment does not merge with 
the new form; it remains in place and fully functional while the user is
 in half-dragon form. Dragons and half dragons cannot benefit from the 
effects of the ring's transformation powers, although they can utilize 
the ring's other abilities.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Rumors abound that other rings exist that are keyed to different dragons and that grant different powers.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level</i>: 15th; <i>Prerequisites</i>: Forge Ring, <i>polymorph self</i>, <i>protection from elements</i>, <i>wall of ice</i>, <i>solid fog</i>, <i>spider climb</i>, creator must be a dragon or half-dragon; <i>Market Price</i>:175,000 gp.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Vial of Icy Sheets: </b>The <i>vial of icy sheets</i><b></b>is
 a clear fluid that creates a region of slippery ice when its contents 
are poured upon the ground (a standard action). The fluid spreads from 
the point of origin to a radius of 10 feet, coating the ground with a 
thin sheet of slippery ice. All creatures caught in this area must make 
Reflex saves (DC 11) or slip and fall. Those that successfully save can 
move at half speed across the surface. Those that remain in the area 
must make a new saving throw each round to avoid falling and to be able 
to move.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Alternatively,
 the vial's contents can be poured upon an object. This encases the 
object with slippery ice, and if the object is carried or wielded, its 
wielder must make a Reflex save (DC 11) to avoid dropping the item. A 
new saving throw must be made each round the item is grasped.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Icy sheets last for 5 rounds before they evaporate away into nothingness. The <i>vial of icy sheets</i> automatically replenishes its supply of liquid once every hour.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The carrier of a <i>vial of icy sheets</i> can walk upon slippery surfaces without fear of falling.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level</i>: 3rd; <i>Prerequisites</i>: Enlarge Spell, Craft Wondrous Item, <i>grease</i>, <i>ray of frost</i>; <i>Market Price</i>: 13,000 gp; <i>Weight</i>: 1 lb.</span></p>
