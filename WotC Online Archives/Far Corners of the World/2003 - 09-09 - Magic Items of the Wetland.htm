<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Explorers and denizens of the wetlands often employ magic to protect them from the dangers found therein. <i>Rings of water walking</i>
 are valued not only because they let the wearer move throughout the 
swamp with ease, but also incidentally provide complete protection from 
quicksand, mud pits, and similar hazards. Items that provide protection 
from disease and poison, such as <i>cloaks of resistance</i> or <i>periapts of health</i>,
 are also sought-after items. Yet there also exists numerous other magic
 items specifically designed to aid swampland explorers, and even more 
items draw upon the latent magical power of the wetland to provide 
dangerous and deadly offensive capabilities.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bag of Endless Swarms</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 is a ratty-looking leather belt pouch cinched shut tightly with a 
length of thick twine. The bag itself bulges and writhes, almost as if 
it were filled to near-bursting capacity with insects and vermin. In 
truth, this gives an excellent clue to the purpose of the bag.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As a standard action, you can open a <i>bag of endless swarms</i>
 and pull out a handful of writhing vermin. You can then hurl this 
handful of vermin at any target square within 760 feet. The ball of 
vermin remains compact until it reaches its destination (or impacts on a
 solid barrier), at which point it explodes into a swarm of biting flies
 and mosquitoes. Treat this swarm of biting swamp insects as a locust 
swarm. The swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area, and it is 
stationary after being summoned. You can use multiple swarms to create a
 wall of insects in this manner, hurling one swarm per round. You can 
also aim the swarm at a location in midair; when the swarm forms in 
midair, it hovers there. A swarm, once created, lasts for 9 minutes or 
until it is destroyed. The bag can produce up to nine separate swarms of
 insects a day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Moderate conjuration; CL 9; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>insect swarm</i>; Price 54,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Blight Bracers</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Blight bracers</i>
 look as if they are made of spongy, fungus-riddled and flaking wood, 
and they carry with them a faint odor of rotting vegetation. 
Nevertheless, the bracers are quite strong and possess powerful magic 
against plants. As long as they are worn, the wearer gains a +2 
competence bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made 
against plants, and he gains a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws 
made against attacks from plant creatures. If the wearer must make a 
grapple check or Escape Artist check to defeat a plant creature's 
grapple check, the wearer gains a +10 competence bonus to his check to 
avoid becoming grappled. Finally, once a day the wearer can cast <i>blight</i>
 on a plant creature he touches, causing 10d6 points of damage to plant 
creatures (Fortitude saving throw for half damage) or instantly slaying a
 noncreature plant.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Moderate necromancy: CL 10; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>blight</i>; Price 54,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Cloak of the Lizardfolk</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The <i>cloak of the lizardfolk</i>
 is a cloak made from the shed skin of a lizardfolk, and it was 
magically treated to retain its coloration, flexibility, and toughness. 
When worn, the cloak infuses its wearer with the characteristics of the 
lizardfolk; her skin and features shift slightly to appear vaguely 
reptilian in nature while the cape is worn. Additionally, the cloak 
tapers into a long tail behind the wearer, which provides an excellent 
aid when jumping, swimming, and balancing.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As long as the <i>cloak of the lizardfolk</i>
 is worn, it grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the wearer's Strength and 
Constitution scores, and provides a +2 natural armor bonus. 
Additionally, the wearer can hold her breath twice as long as normal for
 her race. Finally, the counterbalance provided by the tail-like 
extension of the cloak grants a +4 competence bonus to Jump, Swim, and 
Balance checks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lizardfolk are naturally more inclined to trust and befriend those who wear a <i>cloak of the lizardfolk</i>,
 since lizardfolk druids create these magic items and present them as 
gifts to their allies or their chieftains. The wearer of a <i>cloak of the lizardfolk</i> gains a +4 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks against lizardfolk.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>barkskin</i>, <i>bear's endurance</i>, <i>bull's strength,</i> creator must be a lizardfolk; Price 31,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Hildebrant's Boots of Swampwalking</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Rumor holds that the first <i>boots of swampwalking</i>
 were created ages ago by a bard by the name of Hildebrant. After an 
unfortunate incident involving the king's birthday party, a feral 
bulldog, and a poorly timed <i>pyrotechnics</i> spell, poor Hildebrant 
found himself running for his life from a castle full of enraged 
royalty. And since this was the fifth time something like this had 
happened, Hildebrant had run out of civilized nations to live in without
 fear of royal revenge. So he was forced to move into the swamp.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hildebrant
 refused to adapt to the swamp; instead he tried again and again to use 
his magic to make the swamp adapt to him. He did his best to keep his 
mud shack clean and his yard free of diseased swamp critters, but 
eventually realized his bardic lore wasn't helping. He began to study 
the way of the druid, and he slowly grew more and more comfortable with 
the swamp and knowledgeable in the ways of its magic. Eventually he 
created a pair of boots that not only allowed him to walk above the 
filthy waters of the swamp and ignore the filth and disease in the 
water, but it even allowed him to move from one end of the swamp to 
another in an instant by transporting him between the plants.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ironically,
 once he finished the magic boots, he realized that his years of druidic
 study had instilled in him a love of the swamp. No longer worried about
 getting his feet wet or getting covered with filth, and now able 
himself to move through the plants with astounding magical ease, he gave
 the boots to a gnome explorer he rescued from a pit of quicksand. The 
gnome, a crafty character named Bezelkus, knew a good thing when he saw 
it. He returned to civilization and made himself a tidy profit selling 
copies of the magic boots to adventurers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Hildebrant's boots of swampwalking</i>
 protect the wearer from all forms of disease, supernatural or 
otherwise. In addition, they constantly keep the wearer clean of filth, 
mud, and grime. The wearer never need fear ruining the boots by walking 
through water, for they constantly allow him to walk on water (or 
similar surfaces, such as mud or quicksand). Finally, the wearer may <i>transport via plants</i> once per day.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Moderate transmutation; CL 11; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>remove disease</i>, <i>transport via plants, water walk</i>; Price 57,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Maanvaki Grog</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 vile concoction must be stored in glass containers; its high acidic 
content quickly eats through metal, wood, or stone containers, leaving 
nothing but a filthy stinking stain in its wake. Maanvaki grog is a 
thick, purple liquid that reeks of the swamp and tastes like rotting 
cabbage mixed with rancid chunks of cheese; the whole thing has a 
terrible burning sensation and a surprisingly powerful alcoholic kick. 
The maanvaki secrets of its distillation are unknown, mostly because the
 truth behind the grog's manufacture may be too horrible to bear.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Maanvaki
 enjoy drinking this vile concoction during their feasts and 
celebrations, and they often take part in drinking contests that can 
leave the loser mortally wounded as the acidic stuff eats the imbiber 
from within. Yet those who can stomach the vile stuff quickly realize 
that it has some potent and useful side effects.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Anyone
 who drinks a dose of maanvaki grog suffers 1 point of acid damage and 
must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 + the number of previous doses of grog
 imbibed that day) or become nauseated for 1d10 rounds. Assuming the 
drinker can stand the stuff, he gains a +2 enhancement bonus to his 
Strength score, a -2 penalty to his Wisdom, and +2d6 temporary hit 
points for 10 minutes. Each additional dose of maanvaki grog imbibed 
increases the Strength bonus by +2 and the temporary hit points granted 
by +2d6, to a maximum of +6 enhancement to Strength, -6 to Wisdom, and 
+6d6 temporary hit points. Multiple doses must be taken within 1 round 
for the effects to stack.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Maanvaki
 grog is not addictive, but it can be dangerous to drink in excess 
nonetheless. A character that drinks more than six doses a day must make
 a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15 + the number of doses of grog taken 
that day) or the grog begins to eat away at him internally, dealing 1d6 
points of temporary Constitution damage per minute until the victim is 
saved. Any effect that neutralizes poison neutralizes this effect -- 
until the character is foolish enough to drink more grog.</span></p>
