 forest is alive. Not only do plants and animals bring it to life, but 
more sinister creatures lurk in the dark recesses of the deadfall, the 
tangled pits of roots, and even in the looming canopies above. Many of 
these monsters have become notorious among adventurers, explorers, and 
others who wander the woodlands; what adventurer hasn't heard of the 
tendriculos, monstrous spiders as big as a horse (or bigger), ravenous 
owlbears, or worst of all, of green dragons? Yet other dangers lurk in 
the depths of the woods, dangers that rarely leave the heart of the 
forest . . .</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>What at first seemed to be a moss covered deadfall 
suddenly lurches upright into a vaguely humanoid form, except that 
instead of a head and arms it merely has a writhing nest of six long, 
powerful tentacles. Its legs are stocky and splay outward, merging with 
the surrounding vegetation and uprooting with a nauseating wet rip as it
 moves.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Some say the first mosslords are the unfortunate result 
of illithid experiments where they infused surface vegetation with 
powerful psionic energies. Why the mind flayers would seek to perform 
such experiments is unclear, although it likely has something to do with
 their endless pursuit of creating slave races that can exist and 
operate on the surface. Whatever the original reason, the illithids seem
 to have cut all contact with these creations, which have since 
established themselves as powerful menaces in many of the darker forests
 in the world. Often, increased shambling mound activity is a direct 
result of the arrival of a new mosslord.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Although they seem like mere plants, the mosslord is in 
fact a highly intelligent and dangerous predator. It relentlessly stalks
 all nonplant life in a large reach of woodland and seeks to eradicate 
all such life or transform it into something more pleasing. A mosslord 
becomes less aggressive once it has denuded a region of forest several 
square miles in size of all animal life, and it usually reacts to new 
intrusions with terrible focus. Rarely, a creature with a close bond to 
nature (such as a druid or fey) can approach close enough to a mosslord 
to try to communicate via the mosslord's telepathy. Mosslords sometimes 
take a liking to such creatures and refrain from attempting to transform
 them into plants. In fact, they often spend long hours conversing with 
them on topics that interest plant life.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A mosslord stands 15 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Mosslords understand Common and Sylvan, and though they 
have no vocal apparatus, they can communicate telepathically with any 
creature that can speak a language.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A mosslord is remarkably adept at hiding, despite its 
large size, and it usually lies in wait once it detects a nearby 
nonplant target. Once it attacks, it fights with great tactical skill, 
using the surrounding terrain as cover and brainlancing any spellcasters
 before moving in to crush foes with its tentacles and transform them 
into something more to its liking.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Brainlance (Su):</b> Once a round, a mosslord can 
emit a powerful lance of focused psionic energy as a free action. It can
 target any creature with an Intelligence within 60 feet with this 
brainlance. The creature targeted must make a successful DC 24 Will 
saving throw or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and take 1d6 points of 
Intelligence damage. A successful Will save indicates that the target is
 dazed for 1 round, after which it can act normally; it is also immune 
to that particular mosslord's brainlance power for 24 hours. The save DC
 is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If a mosslord hits an 
opponent with a tentacle attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to 
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of 
opportunity. If it gets a hold, it can use its mossy transformation 
attack on the creature grappled. Thereafter, the mosslord has the option
 to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its tentacle to hold the
 opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the mosslord is not 
considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it 
makes during successive rounds allows it to use its mossy transformation
 attack. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mossy Transformation (Su):</b> A nonplant, living 
creature grappled by a mosslord must make a successful DC 29 Fortitude 
saving throw each round or suffer 1d6 points of Dexterity drain; the 
victim must make a separate saving throw for each tentacle currently 
grappling it. A victim drained to 0 Dexterity collapses inward on 
itself, turning into an inert heap of dark green moss. Over the course 
of the next 1d4 rounds, the victim's mossy carcass swells and transforms
 into a shambling mound. The shambling mound is free-willed, yet regards
 the mosslord that created it as an ally and does what it can to serve 
its creator. A victim transformed in this manner is not dead, but it 
retains no memories, abilities, or skills from its past life. A <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> can restore the victim to its prior form (restoring all drained Dexterity in the process). A <i>break enchantment</i>
 against DC 30 can also revert the victim to its true form (but its 
Dexterity score remains at 0 until other magic restores it). The saving 
throw DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mental Reflection (Su):</b> A mosslord is a plant, 
and therefore it is immune to mind-affecting attacks. Worse, its 
powerful mind can usurp control over mind-affecting attacks that are 
initiated within the range of its telepathy (a 100-foot radius), no 
matter where they are aimed. Any creature that uses a mind-affecting 
attack while in this area has a 50% chance that the attack is reflected 
back upon him, as if the mosslord itself used the attack against him. If
 an attack is reflected, the original target of the attack is not 
affected by the attack. A mosslord always reflects mind-affecting 
attacks that target it specifically. This power has no effect on the 
brainlance power of other mosslords. This power also doesn't work 
against mind-affecting attacks delivered by touch or against effect and 
area mind-affecting attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mulcher<br></b><b>Medium Ooze<br></b><b>Hit Dice:</b> 2d10+14 (25 hp)<br><b>Initiative:</b> -5<br><b>Speed:</b> 10 ft.

<p align="LEFT"><i>A patch of branches, twigs, and pine needles stirs 
and rises up, as if something were buried below. In moments, it becomes 
clear that what lurks below the fallen bits of bark and pinecones is a 
shapeless swath of translucent sludge that reeks with a powerful acrid 
stench.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The mulcher is a dangerous ooze that lurks under several
 layers of fallen debris along the forest floor. It slithers along the 
ground, covered by a protective layer of bark and branches, and is 
constantly on the prowl for a carcass to clamber into and feed upon. Yet
 they aren't picky eaters -- a mulcher won't usually seek out and attack
 other creatures, but if they come upon something sleeping in the 
forest, or if an unwary wanderer steps upon one, they can react with 
blind and terrible power.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A mulcher's attack consist of a thin tendril that tries 
to wrap around a creature's leg and unbalance it. The acid exuded by a 
mulcher eats away only flesh and bone; it has no effect on vegetable 
matter or wood, stone, metal, or other substances.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stench (Ex):</b> When a mulcher moves, its body 
exudes a powerfully unpleasant acrid stink. All living creatures within 5
 feet of a mulcher that make at least a move or a standard action must 
make a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be sickened for 1 round. A <i>delay poison</i> or <i>neutralize poison</i>
 spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with 
immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison 
receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trip (Ex):</b> Whenever a mulcher hits a creature 
that is flat-footed, or critically hits any creature, it can immediately
 make a free trip attack against the creature.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Camouflage (Ex):</b> The mulcher's body is 
transparent, almost like water, and as such it is quite difficult to 
notice it when it is not in motion. A mulcher gains a +20 racial bonus 
on Hide checks in natural areas as a result.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>The creature steps out from behind the gnarled tree 
on legs a bit too thin and a bit too long to be truly human. Its overall
 shape is humanoid, except it is emaciated nearly to the point of being 
skeletal. Its skin has a mottled brown and green hue, and it almost 
looks like tree bark in texture. Its long arms each end in 
three-fingered hands tipped with long, curved talons with cruel 
serrations along the inner curve. Yet the menace's head is perhaps the 
most disturbing. Roughly human-shaped, its face is that of a handsome 
elven man, except that the eyes and mouth are cold, dark gashes that 
flicker with tiny motes of light, like stars in the night sky.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Stories where sinister humanoid shapes flit through the 
depths of supposedly haunted woods are strangely common in some parts of
 the world. Sightings of murderjacks may inspire the majority of these 
stories. A murderjack is a cruel, capricious, and always sadistic fey 
that dwells in heavily forested areas. They are quite intelligent, and 
they often group together in tightly knit groups that hunt in packs. A 
group of murderjacks usually seeks out a solitary individual and uses 
the frightful presence ability to drive the victim deep into the forest 
where it becomes lost. The murderjacks then spend several days 
tormenting the poor soul, racing in to cut and slash at him until 
bleeding lacerations cover the victim's body. Eventually, when the 
victim collapses from fatigue, the murderjacks approach and cure his 
wounds, only to repeat the torment anew upon his waking. Only when the 
victim seems about ready to take his own life or escape do the 
murderjacks swarm, tearing the poor soul limb from limb and draping the 
red ribbons that remain over the trees for miles around.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A murderjack is 7 feet tall but weighs only 100 pounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Murderjacks speak Common and Sylvan.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The murderjack has no interest in fair fights. It 
prefers to use hit-and-run tactics over the course of several hours or 
even days, leaving its victim both horrified and fatigued. Only when 
murderjacks are confident that they outclass their victim, or they 
outnumber him, do they attack. When in a group, they work together to 
flank foes and keep them confused and disorganized with their spells and
 frightful presence.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Frightning Presence (Su):</b> When a murderjack 
charges or attacks, it inspires terror in all creatures within 30 feet 
that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than it has. Each potentially 
affected opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become panicked. 
Creatures with equal or more Hit Dice become shaken only on a failed 
save. If a victim (whatever its Hit Dice) is caught in the range of 
three or more murderjacks and fails to resist at least three of their 
frightning<b></b>presence effects, she also suffers 1d4 points of Wisdom
 damage from the soul-numbing fear. This is a mind-affecting fear 
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spells:</b> A murderjack can cast arcane spells as a 10th-level bard (3/5/5/3/1). A typical murderjack knows the following spells: 0 -- <i>dancing lights</i>, <i>ghost sound</i>, <i>lullaby</i>, <i>mage hand</i>, <i>message</i>, <i>prestidigitation</i>; 1st -- <i>cure light wounds</i>, <i>expeditious retreat</i>, <i>sleep</i> (DC 17), <i>ventriloquism </i>(DC 17); 2nd -- <i>cat's grace</i>, <i>cure moderate wounds</i>, <i>detect thoughts </i>(DC 18), <i>hold person</i> (DC 18); 3rd -- <i>confusion</i> (DC 19), <i>cure serious wounds</i>, <i>deep slumber</i> (DC 19), <i>slow</i> (DC 19); 4th -- <i>dimension door</i>, <i>locate creature</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Woodland Concealment (Su):</b> In woodland areas, the
 murderjack's green and brown seems to blur and fade into the 
brackground. Attacks directed at the murderjack when it is in a woodland
 area suffer a 20% miss chance.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sudden Lunge (Su):</b> Once per hour, a murderjack 
can move up to its speed as a free action. A murderjack often uses this 
ability to rush an opponent during the surprise round so it can make a 
sneak attack.</p>
