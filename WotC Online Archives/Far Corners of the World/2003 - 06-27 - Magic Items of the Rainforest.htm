<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 with the other far corners of the world, numerous magic items are 
associated with the rainforests of the equatorial regions. Ancient 
civilizations that once thrived there developed strange and unique items
 that closely bonded to the natural world all around them. When these 
civilizations crumbled, much of the remnants of their achievements 
crumbled as well and were lost forever as the jungle reclaimed its own. 
The magic items, however, have often resisted erosion and other natural 
processes of reclamation, and today, explorers can find strange 
treasures of the toxic paradise. Along with these rediscovered treasures
 are a few magic devices that have been perfected by contemporary 
spellcasters to aid in jungle exploration.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Cloak of the Couatl:</b> The <i>cloak of the couatl</i>
 is made from the shed feathers and scales of couatls and empowered with
 potent magical defenses to infuse its wearer with many of the couatl's 
qualities. The benign power of this cloak works only for good-aligned 
creatures that wear it; it simply doesn't work for neutrally aligned 
wearers. Evil wearers suffer one negative level for as long as the cloak
 is worn. This negative level cannot be removed without removing the 
cloak, but it never results in a permanent level loss.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When
 worn by a good creature, the cloak grants a +4 enhancement bonus to the
 wearer's Wisdom and Charisma. The wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on
 all Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), and Knowledge (nature) 
checks and may make these as untrained skill checks. The wearer can also
 use the following spell-like abilities once per day: <i>invisibility</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, and <i>polymorph self</i>. Finally, the wearer can use <i>detect thoughts</i>
 at will. The wearer can send a telepathic message to anyone whose 
surface thoughts she is reading (allowing two-way communication).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 13th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (nature), <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, <i>invisibility</i>, <i>polymorph self</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 120,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 1 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Piranha Mask:</b>
 This unnerving mask gives the wearer the visage of a slavering piranha.
 Once worn, the mask bonds with the wearer's face (using the 
headband/hat/helmet magic item slot) and completely hides his true 
features. While worn, the wearer can make one natural attack (bite) per 
round (1d8 points of damage on a hit, plus any Strength modifiers). When
 worn underwater, the mask grants the wearer the Scent ability, as well 
as the ability to breathe water.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It is impossible to speak intelligibly while wearing a <i>piranha mask</i>;
 any words spoken by the wearer are garbled into a sloshing gurgle. 
Spells with verbal components cannot be cast at all while the mask is 
worn.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>water breathing, magic fang</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 40,000 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 2 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Poacher's Blade:</b> A <i>poacher's blade</i>
 is a sickly yellow glowing longsword with a serrated blade. These 
weapons were initially developed by poachers to aid in their cruel 
harvest of trophies, but many adventurers have found the qualities of 
the blade to be especially helpful when exploring areas infested with 
creatures that have natural attacks. Druids and other guardians of 
nature find poacher's blades to be sickening and overly cruel, but the 
swords themselves are not intrinsically evil.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A poacher's blade has all of the abilities of a <i>+1 bane versus animals keen longsword</i>.
 In addition, if the user successfully inflicts a critical hit on a 
creature that has a natural attack (such as a bite, claw, tentacle, or 
gore attack), the strike inflicts normal critical damage and renders one
 of the creature's natural attacks (determine which one randomly if the 
creature has more than one) useless until all the damage from the 
critical hit is somehow healed, either naturally or through healing 
magic.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 13th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>keen edge</i>, <i>summon monster I</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 50,315 gp.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ring of Exploration: </b>This
 plain bronze ring is highly valued by anyone who explores the far 
corners of the world, but they are especially useful for those who seek 
to penetrate jungle interiors since they protect from disease and poison
 as well as solve the problem of passing through dense undergrowth.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 wearer of a ring of exploration remains at a comfortable temperature 
during the most extreme weather conditions, as if he had <i>endure elements (cold)</i> and <i>endure elements (fire)</i> cast on her (negating 5 points of cold and fire damage per round).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The ring also continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment exactly as does a <i>ring of sustenance</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ring grants the woodland stride ability to its wearer, allowing the 
wearer to pass through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and 
similar terrain (as long as it's not magically manipulated) at her 
normal speed without suffering damage or other impairment.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Finally,
 the wearer constantly knows what direction north lies in and can 
unerringly retrace her steps back to the exact point at which she last 
put on the ring, with no chance of becoming lost.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 7th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Forge Ring, <i>create food</i><i>and</i><i>water</i>, <i>endure elements</i>, <i>freedom of movement, know direction</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 41,000 gp.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Vine of Brachiation:</b>
 This unique magic item looks like a small, fist-sized globe of green 
plant matter when not in use. Upon command, it untangles and grows into a
 long, thin vine of up to 50 feet in length. When one end of the vine is
 gripped in one hand, the user can mentally command the other end to 
quickly snake up and attach to any solid plant surface, such as a tree 
branch or a shrub growing on a cliff face. This is a move-equivalent 
action. Once the vine is attached, it can serve as a climbing aid. The 
main use, however, is to allow the user to swing from one location to 
another with shocking speed and ease. The vine magically lengthens and 
shortens as necessary, and it also provides the user with the momentum 
necessary to swing from one location to another. The user can perform 
one swing as a standard action. A swing can transport the user to any 
point within a 50-foot radius of the vine's anchor point. The user can 
detach a <i>vine of brachiation</i> from its anchor as a free action; 
this causes the vine to instantly retract into its spherical form in the
 user's hand. If the user lets go of the vine, it remains in vine form 
until grasped by a creature that wills it to return to spherical form.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If the user has at least 5 ranks in Tumble and carries one <i>vine of brachiation</i>
 in each hand, he can actually use the two vines to swing rapidly 
through any forested area. The vines magically guide the user, 
preventing him from hitting branches, trees, or other solid objects. 
Swinging in this manner is a full round action, but each round the user 
does this he has an effective fly speed of 100 with perfect 
maneuverability.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A <i>vine of brachiation</i>
 is quite tough and has hardness 8 and 20 hit points. It is immune to 
bludgeoning, electricity, and cold damage. It can support 1,000 pounds 
without snapping.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 5th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, <i>entangle</i>, <i>plant growth</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 4,500 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 3 lb.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>War Paint of Primal Rage: </b>This
 magical war paint typically comes in a ceramic jar that contains 5 
doses. When a dose is applied to a creature's face, the magic of the 
warpaint bolsters the creature's convictions and beliefs, granting a +2 
bonus to Will saves for 1 hour.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 a free action, the wearer of the war paint can opt to enter a primal 
rage similar in many ways to a barbarian's rage. While in a primal rage,
 the character gains incredible strength and agility, and her features 
grow feral and bestial. The character gains +4 to Strength, +4 to 
Dexterity, and her base movement rate doubles. Spellcasting is 
impossible while in a primal rage, and for the duration of the primal 
rage, the character suffers a -4 penalty to all Charisma-based skill 
checks. The primal rage persists for 5 rounds, after which the character
 becomes fatigued (-2 to Strength, -2 to Dexterity, can't charge or run)
 for the duration of that encounter. The war paint fades when the primal
 rage ends.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Caster Level:</i> 7th; <i>Prerequisites:</i> Craft Wondrous Item, Iron Will, <i>emotion</i>; <i>Market Price:</i> 2,800 gp; <i>Weight:</i> 1 lb.</span></p>
