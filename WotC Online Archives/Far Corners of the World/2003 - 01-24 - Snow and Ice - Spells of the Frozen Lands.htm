<p class="size2">Winter is a time of wonder and beauty. The snows 
transform the world into a mystical realm and make the familiar into 
something magical. Beautiful icicles form on the edges of buildings and 
branches. But for all its beauty, the snow and ice of winter bring a 
fierce cold, and despite the beauty it brings, the return of warmer 
seasons are welcomed with great joy.</p>
<p class="size2">Yet some places in the world have never known the kiss 
of a springtime thaw -- places where the snow and ice are as permanent a
 fixture of the landscape as the mountains and seas themselves. In these
 regions, exposure to the elements can kill you as quickly as the 
strange beasts and creatures that lurk therein. These realms exist on 
distant shores far to the north and south -- far beyond any regularly 
established trade routes. They also exist in the remote peaks of great 
mountain chains. As with the denizens of other far corners of the world,
 the people of the snow and ice often turn to magic to help protect 
their lives and loved ones from its freezing claws. And as often as not,
 some seek to embrace the savagery and cruelty of the frozen realms and 
work its deadly ways into their magic, as well. </p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Animate Snow</b></span><br> Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Drd 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> Up to a 20 ft. cube of snow<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">You imbue a mass of fallen snow with mobility and a 
semblance of life. The snow to be animated may be natural or magically 
created (as with the <i>sleet storm</i> spell). Snow animated by this 
spell is treated as an animated object. You can animate 1d3+2 Large 
animated objects, 1d3 Huge animated objects, or one Gargantuan animated 
object (see the <i>Monster Manual </i>entry for animated objects for 
statistics). The animated snow can assume any basic shape you wish, and 
it attacks as directed by your vocal commands. Animated snow possesses 
the Blind and Trample special attacks as detailed on page 18 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 for animated objects. In addition, they have the cold subtype, and do 
an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit.</p>
<p class="size2">Animated snow objects suffer 1d6 points of damage each round if they exist in a place with temperatures above freezing.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Anticold Sphere</b></span><br>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> 10 ft.<br><b>Area:</b> 10 ft. radius emanation, centered on you<br><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level (D)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2">You bring into being a mobile, spherical energy field 
that protects against cold. All creatures within the area of the spell 
are immune to cold damage. In addition, the sphere prevents the entrance
 of any creature with the cold subtype. The effect hedges out such 
creatures in the area when it is cast.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Note:</i> This spell can be used only defensively, 
not aggressively; forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that 
the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier (see page 157 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Ice Assassin</b></span><br>Illusion (Shadow)<br><b>Level:</b> Sor/Wiz 9<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M, XP<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 8 hours<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Area:</b> One duplicate creature<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p class="size2">The <i>ice assassin</i> spell is in many ways an improved version of <i>simulacrum</i>.
 Developed by powerful frost mages who have more than their fair share 
of enemies to fight, an ice assassin is an effective way to destroy an 
enemy without putting yourself at risk.</p>
<p class="size2">An ice assassin spell creates a living, breathing 
creature that is a near perfect duplicate of an already existing 
creature. The duplicate is formed entirely out of ice, but once the 
spell is in effect, it appears as an exact duplicate to all but its 
source, who always sees the ice assassin as an animated ice statue of 
himself. The ice assassin possesses all of the skills, abilities, and 
memories possessed by the original, but its personality is warped and 
twisted by an all-consuming need to slay the original. It also 
constantly uses <i>locates creature</i> on its duplicate at a caster 
level equal to your own. If its quarry is outside the range of this 
effect, the ice assassin must rely on its own cleverness or advice from 
you to track the original. In addition, the ice assassin has the cold 
subtype, which makes it immune to cold damage but imparts a weakness to 
fire damage (on a failed saving throw against a fire attack, the ice 
assassin suffers double damage). Creatures familiar with the original 
might detect the ruse with a successful Spot check. You must make a 
Disguise check (gaining a +10 circumstance bonus from the power of the 
spell) when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is.</p>
<p class="size2">At all times, the ice assassin remains under your 
absolute command. You possess a telepathic link to the ice assassin, and
 when you concentrate, you receive a clear image of the area surrounding
 the ice assassin as if you were scrying on it. Further, you can have 
any spell you cast on yourself affect the ice assassin as well; this 
includes spells with a target of "You" only. These benefits persist as 
long as you and the ice assassin remain within a mile of each other. If 
the ice assassin travels beyond this range, it continues to function and
 seek out its nemesis, but you have no direct control over it. </p>
<p class="size2">An ice assassin has no ability to become more powerful;
 it cannot increase its level or abilities. Damage caused to the ice 
assassin can be repaired only via a complex process requiring 1 day, 100
 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped laboratory. If the ice assassin 
is reduced to 0 hit points by any damage save for fire damage, it 
explodes into a burst of icy shrapnel in a 20-foot radius that causes 
1d6 points of cold damage for every other caster level you possess; a 
successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage done. An ice assassin 
slain by fire damage simply melts into a pool of water.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Material Component: </i>This spell is cast over the 
ice statue of the creature to be duplicated. Some portion of the 
creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, and so on) must be placed inside 
the ice statue as it is constructed. In addition, the spell requires 
powdered diamond worth 20,000 gp.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>XP Cost:</i> 5,000.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Mantle of the Icy Soul</b></span><br>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Clr 6, Drd 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M, XP<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Area:</b> Creature touched<br><b>Duration:</b> Permanent<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes (harmless)</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Mantle of the icy soul</i> permanently adds the cold subtype to the targeted creature. The recipient of a <i>mantle of the icy soul</i>
 becomes immune to cold damage, but takes double damage from fire unless
 a saving throw for half damage is allowed, in which case it takes half 
damage on a success or double damage on a failure. The skin, hair, and 
scales of the creature subtly change color to take on an icy blue tint, 
and its breath does not frost in cold temperatures.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Material Component: </i>A handful of ice or snow that must be pressed to the target's body.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>XP Cost:</i> 2,000.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Snowsong</b></span><br>Enchantment [Compulsion, Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 6<br><b>Components:</b> V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> 15-ft. radius, 30-ft.-high cylinder<br><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Snowsong</i> fills the area of effect with a soft 
snowfall that melts and evaporates on contact with anything solid. When 
you cast the spell, you must designate any creatures in the area of 
effect as allies or enemies.</p>
<p class="size2">While the snow falls, all allies in the area hear a 
soft, lilting song that bolsters their spirits and confidence. At the 
same time, as the snow strikes their flesh, it melts and washes away 
scars, wounds, and filth. Allies under the effect of the snow gain a +6 
enhancement bonus to their Charisma scores, a +4 morale bonus on all 
checks and attack rolls, and a +2 insight bonus to their Armor Class. In
 addition, the snow imparts fast healing 1 and cold resistance 30 to all
 affected allies.</p>
<p class="size2">Enemies in the area of a snowsong have a much different
 experience. To them, the snow is bitterly cold and leaves scabs and 
angry welts when it lands on unprotected skin. They perceive the music 
as a discordant jangle of crashes, scrapes, and howls. As long as they 
remain in the area, they suffer a -6 enhancement penalty to their 
Charisma scores, a 20% miss chance to all melee attacks due to the 
swirling snow, and a 20% spell failure chance (for both divine and 
arcane spells) when casting any spells with a verbal component. In 
addition, enemies in the area suffer 1 additional point of cold damage 
each time they suffer damage from a physical or magical attack. Enemies 
can resist the effects of a <i>snowsong</i> with a successful Will saving throw.</p>
<p class="size2">These benefits remain in place as long as the spell 
persists and as long as the target remains in the spell's area. If a 
creature leaves the spell's area, all effects stop until it returns to 
the <i>snowsong's</i> area of effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size2red"><b>Winter's Embrace</b></span><br>Evocation [Cold]<br><b>Level:</b> Clr 4, Drd 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Area:</b> One creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Winter's embrace</i> covers the victim with sheets 
of ice and lumps of snow. If the victim resists the spell, the ice and 
snow instantly slough from its body, causing a mere 1d4 points of cold 
damage and ending the effect. If the victim fails to resist, the ice and
 snow cling tenaciously to its body and cause 1d8 points of cold damage 
per round. Each round, the victim can make a new Fortitude saving throw 
to avoid suffering damage that round. The second time a victim suffers 
damage from a single casting of <i>winter's embrace,</i> it becomes fatigued. The fourth time it suffers damage from the same spell, it becomes exhausted.</p>
