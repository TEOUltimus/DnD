 who have attempted to explore the Lost Coast find that, as with the 
other Far Corners of the World, specific and often customized magic 
items make the difference between abject failure and moderate success. 
The danger of the region is such that many of these items end up 
remaining in the Lost Coast when their users fall victim to the region's
 dangers. Some of these items, like the <i>selkie sash</i>, work best in coastline or underwater regions. Other items, such as the <i>fan of erosion</i>, are more universal and can pack quite a shock for those unprepared for their unique qualities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Boots of the Lost Coast:</b> A pair of <i>boots of the lost coast</i>
 looks like a well-worn set of knee-high black leather boots with thick 
soles. The boots are stiff and feel slightly slippery, but when put on 
they are surprisingly flexible and comfortable. The boots are 
waterproof, and water never leaks into them, even if the wearer stands 
in water deeper than the boot tops. While worn, the boots grant a +5 
competence bonus on Balance and Swim checks, and as long as the wearer 
is within 30 feet of water or wading in water (but not swimming), she 
gains a +4 bonus on Initiative checks. Finally, the wearer of <i>boots of the lost coast </i>can activate <i>Barlen's crabwalk</i>
 (see The Lost Coast: Spells of the Tides) as a standard action for up 
to 11 rounds each day. The duration of the crabwalk effect need not be 
consecutive rounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, 8 ranks in Swim, <i>Barlen's crabwalk</i>; Price 28,800 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Conch of Tidal Summons:</b> This beautiful shell is 
streaked with a rainbow of color. It can be blown like a trumpet, and it
 creates a mournful, low-pitched tone that carries for miles when the 
wind is right. A character who uses a <i>conch of tidal summons</i> 
gains a +5 competence bonus on any Perform (wind instruments) check made
 to play a tune or create an effect using the instrument. The <i>conch's</i> true powers, though, lie in its ability to summon creatures of the tides to do the user's bidding. Summoning a creature with a <i>conch of tidal summons</i>
 is a full-round action. Anyone can use the item to summon 1d4+1 sea 
cats or 1d4+1 monstrous crabs. If the user has at least 9 ranks in 
Perform (wind instruments), she can instead summon 1d3 orca whales or 
1d3 adult tojanidas. Alternatively, if the user has at least 15 ranks in
 Perform (wind instruments), she can summon a single dire shark or a 
single razoreel swarm. All creatures summoned with the <i>conch</i> 
remain for 15 rounds or until slain, and they follow the spoken 
instructions of the one who holds the conch. The conch summons creatures
 once per day. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Strong conjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, 15 ranks in Perform (wind instruments), <i>summon nature's ally VIII</i>; Price 47,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Figurine of Wondrous Power (Limestone Crab):</b> A <i>limestone crab </i>appears as a miniature statuette, often badly eroded, of a crab. When the <i>figurine</i>
 is tossed down and the correct command word is spoken, it becomes a 
living monstrous crab. The monstrous crab obeys and serves its owner; it
 understands Common but does not speak. The monstrous crab can serve as a
 beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant as its owner desires. Unlike a
 normal monstrous crab, the <i>limestone crab</i> retains some of the qualities of stone when animated and has hardness 3. A <i>limestone crab</i> can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a <i>limestone crab</i> is broken or destroyed in its
 statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power 
departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a 
statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A <i>limestone crab</i> always feels damp to the touch, as if it had just been plucked from a tide pool.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>stoneskin</i>; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gull Whistle:</b> This small whistle is carved from a
 seashell. When blown, it conjures a single sea gull to your location. 
The gull flies down to land nearby, at which time the whistle generates 
an <i>animal messenger</i> effect with the gull. Unlike the standard <i>animal messenger</i> spell, though, the recipient of the message can use an <i>animal messenger</i>
 effect on the gull as well, as long as she generates this effect within
 10 minutes of receiving the message and as long as the recipient of 
this second message is you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animal messenger</i>; Price 7,500 gp, Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ring of the Octopus: </b>A <i>ring of the octopus</i>
 appears as a strangely flexible ring made out of what appears to be 
braided octopus tentacles. When worn, the tentacles writhe and grip the 
wearer's finger tightly, so that only the wearer can remove the ring 
with ease. A <i>ring of the octopus</i> allows the wearer's limbs to become surprisingly flexible and grants a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As a standard action, the wearer can transform the arm 
on which the ring is worn into a large octopus tentacle. This tentacle 
gives the wearer a natural tentacle attack that has a reach of 20 feet. 
The tentacle deals 1d4 points of damage on a successful hit, plus the 
wearer's Strength modifier. If the tentacle attack hits, the wearer can 
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack 
of opportunity. If she wins the grapple check, she establishes a hold 
and immediately deals 2d8 (plus her Strength modifier) points of 
constriction damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, <i>polymorph</i>; Price 87,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Selkie Sash:</b> This filmy sash of nearly 
transparent material always feels moist to the touch. Said to be infused
 with the fey magic of selkie druids, a nonfey creature that wears a 
selkie sash does so either about the waist, taking up a belt slot, or on
 the neck, taking up the necklace slot. As long as it is worn, the sash 
grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma. 
Additionally, the wearer gains a swim speed of 60 feet. Once per day, 
the wearer can <i>polymorph</i> into a seal (use the statistics for a 
dog, except with a swim speed of 60) as long as she is swimming in water
 at the time. The wearer can remain in seal form for as long as she 
desires; switching back to her true form is a standard action. The 
wearer reassumes her true form as well as soon as she emerges from the 
water.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Upon changing, the wearer regains lost hit points as if 
she had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore 
temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and 
changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject 
reverts to its original form, though it remains dead. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, <i>polymorph</i>; Price 46,800 gp. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Staff of the Tides:</b> This gnarled staff of 
driftwood is draped with seaweed and studded with brightly colored 
seashells. It allows use of the following spells.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>undertow</i> (see The Lost Coast: Spells of the Tides) (1 charge)</li>
<li><i>fog cloud</i> (1 charge)</li>
<li><i>control water</i> (1 charge)</li>
<li><i>baleful polymorph</i> (into harmless tide pool denizen) (2 charges)</li>
<li><i>summon nature's ally VII</i> (creatures with the Aquatic or Water subtype only) (3 charges)</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Strong conjuration; CL 13th; Craft Staff, <i>baleful polymorph, control water, fog cloud, summon nature's ally VII, undertow</i>; Price 83,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trident of Red Brine:</b> Said by some to be the prototype of the infamous trident <i>Wave</i>, a <i>trident of red brine</i> is a <i>+2 keen bane vs. aquatic creatures trident </i>made of magically hardened red coral. On a successful critical hit, the <i>trident</i>
 causes an additional 2d6 points of damage as it draws off blood and 
water from the target's body, desiccating the target horribly. A 
creature that suffers this additional damage must also make a successful
 Fortitude saving throw (DC 14) or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. 
Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not suffer this additional
 desiccation damage. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Strong necromancy; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>horrid wilting, keen edge</i>, <i>summon monster I</i>; Price 72,315 gp; weight 4 lb.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Underwater Action (Weapon Quality)</b>: This weapon quality can be applied to both melee and ranged weapons. An <i>underwater action</i> weapon functions underwater as well as it does on land, as if its wielder were under the effects of a <i>freedom of movement </i>spell
 (but only for purposes of attacking with the weapon). Ranged weapons 
impart this quality upon any ammunition fired from them; an <i>underwater action longbow</i> can be wielded underwater with ease.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>freedom of movement</i>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
