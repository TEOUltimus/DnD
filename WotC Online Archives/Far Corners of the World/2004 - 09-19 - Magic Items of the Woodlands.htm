 other far corners of the world, temperate woodlands are often easily 
reachable to explorers and adventurers. As a result, many magic items 
tied to the woodlands are already fairly accessible and recognizable. 
Items like the <i>staff of the woodlands</i>, the <i>sylvan scimitar</i>, and <i>Quaal's tree feather tokens</i>
 are well known. Yet these represent only a small number of the true 
wonders that have been created in the deepest, darkest heart of the vast
 woodlands. Some, like the <i>bracers of brachiation</i> and the <i>treebed</i>,
 were created by those who wished to make exploring the woodlands a 
safer prospect. But the denizens of the woodland itself created the most
 impressive of them. Few forget the awesome power of the <i>horn of the awakened forest</i>!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bracers of Brachiation:</b> The slim <i>bracers of brachiation</i>
 grant the wearer a climb speed of 20 feet in forested areas. The user 
gains a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks, and it can always choose to
 take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. In addition, 
while using its climb speed to move in forested areas, the creature 
gains a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks and Reflex saving throws.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>spider climb,</i> creator must have at least 10 ranks in Climb; Price 18,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bracers of Foesmiting:</b> The faces of these wooden <i>bracers of foesmiting</i>
 depict relaxing scenes of woodland majesty. The bracers allow you to 
preserve natural features in the area of destructive spells or 
spell-like abilities you cast. When you cast the spell with the acid, 
cold, electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor, the effects do not harm 
natural vegetation, ground cover, and any creatures of the animal or 
plant type in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. You do not 
need line of sight to an object to exclude it from the damage, but you 
must know the creature or object is there to prevent the damage from 
applying. </p>
<p align="left">Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, creator must have the animal companion class feature; Price 16,000 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cutting (Weapon Quality):</b> The cutting weapon 
quality can be placed only on a slashing weapon. A cutting weapon's 
blade becomes serrated, and it works especially well against plants and 
plant creatures. The weapon ignores a wooden object's hardness. 
Additionally, a cutting weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage 
against a wooden object or a plant creature.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>blight, keen edge</i>; Price +1 bonus.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Feytracker:</b> A <i>feytracker</i> is a handheld 
hoop of cold iron about the size and shape of a magnifying glass, save 
that it is not set with a lens. This magic device aids greatly in 
tracking creatures not only in wooded terrain, but in any terrain, 
provided the creature being tracked is a natural being. The <i>feytracker</i>
 grants a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track animals 
and plant creatures. It grants a +15 competence bonus on Survival checks
 made to track fey, rangers, and druids.</p>
<p align="left">A <i>feytracker</i> can even track a creature that uses a <i>pass without trace</i>
 effect to avoid leaving tracks. In this case, the creature to be 
tracked gains a Will saving throw (DC 15). If the creature fails its 
save, it leaves behind faint traces that only a <i>feytracker</i> can detect. When a user looks through the <i>feytracker,</i>
 the user sees marks that resemble the tracked creature's footprints. 
Tracking in this manner otherwise works just like tracking a creature 
that did not use <i>pass without trace</i>. When tracking such a 
creature, you do not gain a circumstance bonus on Survival checks if the
 creature is an animal, plant, fey, ranger, or druid.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate divination; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>true seeing</i>; Price 22,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Horn of the Wakened Forest (Minor Artifact):</b> The <i>horn of the wakened forest</i>
 looks like an oversized ram's horn, but closer examination reveals that
 it is carved from wood. In truth, these objects are fantastically 
powerful and rare minor artifacts that dryad druids purportedly carved 
from the living hearts of trees who were willing to give up their 
existence to help create an object of great power to help protect the 
forest.</p>
<p align="left">Anyone can blow a <i>horn of the wakened forest</i> as a
 standard action, and doing so generates a low, rumbling tone that seems
 to reverberate through the bones and branches of all creatures and 
trees within an the area.</p>
<p align="left">If used in an area of civilization, the sound causes 
wooden buildings within an 80-foot spread to rumble and seethe as the 
spirits of the wooden planks and boards rise up in rebellion. All wooden
 buildings in this area immediately take 100 points of damage; this is 
enough to collapse a moderately sized wooden building with ease. 
Hardness does not reduce this damage. Any creature caught inside a 
collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 
15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble. Creatures that are pinned 
take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned
 character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution 
check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until 
freed or dead.</p>
<p align="left">If used in an area not dominated by wooded terrain or 
civilization, the horn instead causes an explosive eruption of plant 
growth. Over the course of 1 round, the terrain in an 80-foot spread 
violently transforms into a dense forest. Any nonplant creatures in this
 area take 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage from the explosive growth; a
 DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. At the end of the round, 
creatures that fail their saves end up 3d4x10 feet in the air, suspended
 in the tangled branches of the trees. Creatures of Large size (or 
larger) cannot be supported by the branches and immediately fall. The 
user of the horn can select any creatures in the area to be immune to 
the effects of the explosive growth at the time the horn is sounded. The
 forest so created by this use of the horn is real, and if the 
surrounding terrain is hospitable, the forest thrives. </p>
<p align="left">If used in a forested area, the horn's effects are even more astounding. In such a region, three effects simultaneously occur.</p>
<p align="left"> {{bu}}All of the undergrowth in an 80-foot spread animates and functions as an <i>entangle</i> spell against any creatures that would do you or the forest harm. This <i>entangle</i>
 effect is heightened to a 9th-level spell, for a base save DC of 19 
modified by your Wisdom modifier. This effect fades after 24 hours.</p>
<p align="left"> {{bu}}All allies of yourself or the forest immediately 
gain fast healing 5 as long as they remain within 80 feet of where you 
initially sounded the <i>horn</i>. This effect fades after 24 hours.</p>
<p align="left"> {{bu}}Six trees within 80 feet of you are immediately 
transformed into treants with maximum hit points and a +4 bonus to their
 Strength and Constitution. These treants serve you without question, as
 long as your goals don't seem to work against the safety of the 
surrounding forest. The treants can travel beyond the initial 80-foot 
range of the effect, but once 24 hours have passed, they revert to 
normal trees. </p>
<p align="left">Horn Treant (hp 80) see Monster Manual, page 244, except
 grapple +24, slam +14 melee (2d6+11), trample 2d6+15 (Reflex DC 24 
half), Fort +12.</p>
<p align="left">The power of a <i>horn of the awakened forest</i> is potent, and as such it cannot be used more than once per day.</p>
<p align="left">Strong conjuration; CL 20th; Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tendriculos Seed: </b>This spherical brown object 
looks like a closed up pinecone. It rattles when shaken, and it feels 
heavier than it looks like it should. When placed on the ground and when
 the command word is spoken, the <i>seed</i> instantaneously opens and 
transforms into a fully grown tendriculos under the complete control of 
its owner. The tendriculos can understand simple spoken orders, like 
"Attack those creatures" or "Guard this grove of trees," but it can't 
follow anything more complex. The tendriculos remains for one day before
 wilting; a <i>tendriculos seed</i> may be used only once.</p>
<p align="left">If the <i>tendriculos seed</i> is activated in a 
forested area, the tendriculos created is hasted and gains a +4 sacred 
bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.</p>
<p align="left">Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>control plants</i>; Price 6,000 gp, Weight 5 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Treebed:</b> A <i>treebed</i> looks (and functions) 
like an ordinary bedroll. If unrolled in the branches of a tree, though,
 it attaches to surrounding branches and the trunk in a manner similar 
to a hammock. A creature that sleeps in the <i>treebed</i> is protected from the elements (as if by <i>endure elements</i>) and remains dry and comfortable even in the most violent downpours. Finally, the <i>treebed</i> becomes warded with an <i>alarm</i> spell when so deployed.</p>
<p align="left">Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>alarm,</i><i>endure elements</i>; Price 2,750 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p>
