<p class="size2">The twisting ways of the Underdark have spawned some of
 the most infamous and notorious creatures and races to haunt the 
nightmares of adventurers. Truth be told, though, the drow, illithids, 
umber hulks, purple worms, and beholders are merely a tiny fraction of 
the terrors that lurk in the hidden depths below. There exist creatures 
that not only have never seen the light of the sun or moon, but that 
have no idea that such things even exist! The majority of these obscure 
creatures are scavengers or parasites like the skitterhaunt, or 
efficient killers like the pale flenser. A few of them, however, are 
remnants of ancient civilizations long since lost. The sickstone golem 
is an example of this type since it is the last remaining trace of a 
truly alien race of deep dwelling monstrosities.</p>
<p class="size2"><span class="size3red"><b>Pale Flenser</b></span><br><b>Medium-Size Plant</b><br><b>Hit Dice:</b> 3d8+6 (19 hp)<br><b>Initiative:</b> +3<br><b>Speed:</b> Fly 50 ft.

<p class="size2">The pale flenser may at first look like nothing more 
than a strange fungus inhabitant of the Underdark, but in truth these 
cruel and hateful plants are fairly intelligent. Despite this 
intelligence, the pale flensers seem to have no interest in forming 
societies or achieving anything apart from frugal survival. More likely,
 the actual needs and desires of these fungi menaces are so alien in 
nature that they simply cannot be comprehended by humanity.</p>
<p class="size2">A pale flenser consists of a collection of bulbous, 
leathery, gas-filled bags, each of which is about the size of a human 
head. From atop this mass of bags seethes a writhing forest of hundreds 
of 15-foot-long, terribly thin tendrils. These tendrils are studded with
 tiny razor-sharp barbs. The whole mass is either pale yellow or pale 
brown in color; the tendrils are milky and almost translucent. The pale 
flenser's leathery bags quickly fill with volatile gas, allowing it to 
float on air currents. It can propel itself through the air with great 
speed by venting this foul-smelling gas.</p>
<p class="size2">A pale flenser weighs about 80 pounds. They communicate
 with others of their kind with a complex sign language; although 
understanding of the languages of other creatures is not above their 
intellect, it certainly seems to be above their interest.</p>
<p class="size2">Pale flensers can grow to Huge size. Once a pale flenser becomes Huge, it can no longer fly and gains a ground speed of 5 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A pale flenser gains nourishment from feeding on the 
blood and other vital fluids of vertebrate creatures. It prefers to 
stalk and attack landbound creatures, and it takes advantage of its 
ability to fly and stay out of reach of dangerous melee attacks while 
lashing with its tendrils. Although a pale flenser has hundreds of 
tendrils, it can make a maximum of six attacks per round with them. The 
flenser's tendrils are treated as ranged attacks with a maximum range 
increment of 15 feet, similar to the way attacks with a whip are made. 
The flenser's tendrils inflict lethal damage on a hit and tend to carve 
large shallow wounds that provide the fungus with lots of blood to 
settle down on and soak up. A flenser feeds only on helpless targets; 
the act of feeding inflicts no additional damage on the victim since the
 flenser feeds so slowly. A pale flenser has no melee attacks; if it is 
confronted in melee it attempts to flee and resume making ranged 
attacks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Augmented Critical (Ex):</b> A pale flenser 
threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 18-20. On a 
successful critical hit with a tendril attack, it deals triple damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Disease (Ex): </b>Anyone wounded by a pale flenser 
must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 13) or become infected by 
its spores. Pale flenser spores have an incubation period of 1d3 days, 
after which their growth manifests as itchy pale streaks just under the 
skin. The growth deals 1d3 points of temporary Dexterity damage (see 
Disease in Chapter 3 of the <i><b>Dungeon Master</b>'s Guide</i>).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Explosive (Ex):</b> The gas filling the pale 
flenser's bags is quite explosive. If a pale flenser ever takes fire 
damage, it must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half the fire 
damage it takes), or it explodes. This explosion has a burst of 20 feet 
and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to all in this area (Reflex DC 13 
half).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> A pale flenser is blind, but it
 maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature by detecting heat 
and subtle shifts in air currents. This ability enables it to discern 
objects and creatures within 80 feet. The pale flenser usually does not 
need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice living creatures within 
range of its blindsight.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Plant Traits (Ex):</b> A pale flenser is immune to poison, <i>sleep</i>, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sunlight Vulnerabilty (Ex): </b>A pale flenser is 
susceptible to sunlight and takes 1 point of temporary Constitution 
damage per minute of exposure to such conditions (no saving throw 
allowed). A pale flenser reduced to 0 Constitution in this manner melts 
into a steaming puddle of noxious white paste.</p>

<p class="size2">In the deepest reaches of the Underdark, the 
lightlessness gives way to a sickly greenish glow. Desperate and lost 
explorers may mistake the glow for safety, when in truth their situation
 has gone from bad to worse, for in the deepest regions the stone itself
 is deadly. This glowing, sickening material is known as sickstone, a 
rare and dangerous material used by long-dead races for numerous 
projects. The most resilient of these projects is the terrible sickstone
 golem.</p>
<p class="size2">The appearance of the sickstone golem may be the only 
remaining clue as to the nature and appearance of their creators. A 
sickstone golem's lower body looks like a set of three centipedes joined
 at the head, though at this juncture a tangled mass of stony spikes 
rises. From within the spikes protrude a pair of multijointed arms with 
seven fingers arranged in a radial manner on the hand, and above the 
nest of spikes towers a leering spiny batlike head atop a serpentine 
neck. The entire thing is fashioned of small interlocking segments of 
greenish silver glowing sickstone, which is a material not quite metal 
and not quite volcanic stone. (Full details on this material can be 
found in next month's installment of the Far Corners of the World).</p>
<p class="size2">What service the sickstone golems provided for their 
ancient creators is a mystery. Today, these destructive and dangerous 
creatures patrol the deep reaches of the Underdark, possibly fulfilling 
their final orders as guardians. When they come across intruders, their 
attacks are swift and decisive.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">Like most golems, the sickstone golem is a slow and 
lumbering creature. It lacks any sense of planning and simply lumbers up
 to its target and smashes at it with its arms until the foe is dead or 
victorious. When a sickstone golem is destroyed, the magical 
enhancements on its body fail and the resulting wash of magical energies
 cause the thing to crumble into inert silvery dust.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Nauseating Aura (Su):</b> The magical properties of 
the sickstone golem's poisonous body are enhanced and magnified when it 
is created. These sickening energies provide a silvery-green 
illumination to a 60-foot radius. Any living creature in this area must 
make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 22) each round or become nauseated for
 the duration of that round. A new saving throw must be made each round.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sickening Touch (Su): </b>A living creature struck 
by a sickstone golem must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 22) or take 
1d6 points of permanent Constitution drain as the magical energies of 
the creature's sickstone body leach away life and energy. Stone or metal
 creatures struck by a sickstone golem are immune to this effect, but 
they may suffer from its ability to sicken stone and metal (see below).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Construct Traits:</b> A sickstone golem is immune to mind-affecting effects, and to poison, <i>sleep</i>,
 paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and 
any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on 
objects. The creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, 
ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive 
damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through repair. It 
cannot be raised or resurrected. A sickstone golem has darkvision 
(60-foot range).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Magic Immunity (Ex): </b>A sickstone golem is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows. A <i>transmute rock to mud</i> spell slows it (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while <i>transmute rock to sickstone</i> (see "The Hidden Depths Below: Spells of the Deep Underdark") {{link to October article}} heals it of all damage. <i>Stone to flesh</i>
 does not harm the golem, but it does make it vulnerable to any normal 
attack for the following round (this does not include spells, except for
 those that cause damage). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sicken Stone and Metal (Su):</b> Any stone or metal 
object that strikes a sickstone golem (or any stone or metal creature 
that comes in contact with it) must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 
22) or become infused with the magical energies that course through the 
golem's body. Each time an object becomes infused with these energies, 
its hardness is permanently reduced by 1d6 points. If an object's 
hardness is reduced below 0, it crumbles to dust. A stone or metal 
creature also takes 1d6 points of permanent hit point loss each time it 
fails to resist this ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Construction</b></p>
<p class="size2">Although the exact method for creating sickstone golems
 has been lost for centuries, the details are given here should they be 
rediscovered (DM's option).</p>
<p class="size2">A sickstone golem's body is constructed from 7,000 
pounds of sickstone fragments and shards, fitted together like a 
three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. The golem costs 120,000 gp to create, 
which includes 2,500 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a 
successful Craft (sculpting or masonry) check (DC 23).</p>
<p class="size2">The creator must be 16th level and able to cast arcane 
spells. The creator need not be immune to the effects of sickstone, but 
since he must work with the stuff for quite some time, he should take 
suitable precautions. Completing the ritual drains 2,400 XP from the 
creator and requires <i>geas/quest</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, <i>polymorph any object</i>, and<i> transmute rock to sickstone.</i></p>

<p class="size2">Skitterhaunts are strange oozes that cannot exist on 
their own. They are parasites that live inside the shells of monstrous 
vermin they have infested and killed. To outward appearances, a 
skitterhaunt appears the same as a normal version of the monstrous 
vermin it has infested. Close observation reveals that the "vermin" is 
slower and less spry than usual, and that it seems to weep clear, sticky
 fluid from the mouth and cracks in its armor. If a skitterhaunt is 
slain, the sticky ooze that comprises its body quickly liquefies and 
runs out of the host, leaving behind an empty shell.</p>
<p class="size2">The skitterhaunt presented above uses a Large monstrous spider as the base creature.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A skitterhaunt spider prowls the tunnels of the 
Underdark on the constant search for more vermin to infest or for 
anything else that moves (so that it can eat).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Acid Spray (Ex): </b>Once every minute, the 
skitterhaunt spider can spray a line of acid out from any cracks or 
openings in its chitinous armor. To do so, the skitterhaunt spider makes
 a ranged touch attack against a target within 120 feet. If it hits, the
 target takes 3d6 points of acid damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Infest Vermin (Ex):</b> If a skitterhaunt spider 
damages a living vermin, it can attempt to infest the creature. This is a
 free action for the skitterhaunt spider, although it can attempt it 
only once per round. The damaged vermin must make a Fortitude saving 
throw (DC 15) to avoid becoming infested. An infested vermin takes 1d8 
points of temporary Strength damage per day. Once its Strength score 
reaches 0, the vermin dies and the skitterhaunt spider begins to ooze 
from its previous shell into the new host's exoskeleton, replacing the 
creature's internal organs with its own body. This process rebuilds the 
host creature's lost Strength slowly, at the rate of 1 point per day. 
During this time, the skitterhaunt is helpless and immobile. When the 
host creature's Strength returns to its previous value, the skitterhaunt
 has completely taken over the new vermin's body. It then awakens, fully
 mobile, and begins to seek out new vermin to infest.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex):</b> A skitterhaunt's entire body is
 a primitive sensory organ that enables it to discern objects and 
creatures within 40 feet. The skitterhaunt usually does not need to make
 Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its 
blindsight. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this ability and forces the skitterhaunt to rely on its vision (which is as good as a human's).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Ooze Traits:</b> A skitterhaunt is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep</i>, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sonic Immunity (Ex):</b> Skitterhaunts are immune to sonic damage and effects.</p>

vermin (referred to hereafter as the "base creature"). Vermin with this 
template become oozes.</p>
<p class="size2">A skitterhaunt uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Dice: </b>Change to d10. A skitterhaunt also gains bonus hit points for its size as if it were an ooze.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Speed: </b>Reduce by 10; if this reduces a speed type to 0 or less, the skitterhaunt cannot use that movement type.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>AC:</b> The base creature's natural armor bonus 
becomes an armor bonus for the skitterhaunt, as if the creature were 
actually wearing armor made from its host's exoskeleton. The reduction 
of the base vermin's Dexterity score reduces the skitterhaunt's AC by 2 
points.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Attacks</b>: As base creature.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Damage:</b> The skitterhaunt deals an additional 1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special Attacks: </b>The skitterhaunt loses any 
special attacks that require the manufacturing of a substance from the 
base creature's body. This includes poison, acid, and webs. Special 
attacks like improved grab and squeeze are unaffected. In addition, the 
skitterhaunt gains the following additional special attacks.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Acid Spray (Ex)</i>: Once every minute, the 
skitterhaunt can spray a line of acid out from any cracks or openings in
 its chitinous armor. The skitterhaunt makes a ranged touch attack 
against a target within 120 feet. If it hits, the target takes as many 
d6 of acid damage as the skitterhaunt has HD. For example, a 4-HD giant 
wasp skitterhaunt would inflict 4d6 points of acid damage with its acid 
spray.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Infest Vermin (Ex)</i>: If a skitterhaunt damages a 
living vermin, it can attempt to infest the vermin. This is a free 
action for the skitterhaunt, although it can attempt it only once per 
round. The damaged vermin must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 
half the skitterhaunt's HD + its Constitution modifier) to avoid 
becoming infested. An infested vermin takes 1d8 points of temporary 
Strength damage per day. Once its Strength score reaches 0, the vermin 
dies and the skitterhaunt begins to ooze from its previous shell into 
the new host's exoskeleton, replacing the creature's internal organs 
with its own body. This process rebuilds the host creature's lost 
Strength slowly, at the rate of 1 point per day. During this time, the 
skitterhaunt is helpless and immobile. When the host creature's Strength
 returns to its previous value, the skitterhaunt has completely taken 
over the new vermin's body. It then awakens, fully mobile, and begins to
 seek out new vermin to infest.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special Qualities: </b>The skitterhaunt loses all 
the special qualities granted for being a vermin, but gains all those 
granted for being an ooze. In addition, the skitterhaunt gains the 
following special qualities.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Blindsight (Ex)</i>: A skitterhaunt's entire body is
 a primitive sensory organ. This enables it to discern objects and 
creatures within 40 feet. The skitterhaunt usually does not need to make
 Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its 
blindsight. A <i>silence</i> spell negates this ability and forces the skitterhaunt to rely on its vision (which is as good as a human's).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Sonic Immunity (Ex)</i>: Skitterhaunts are immune to sonic damage and effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Ooze Traits</i>: A skitterhaunt is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep</i>, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Saves:</b> Same as the base creature, modified for new ability scores.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Abilities: </b>A skitterhaunt's Dexterity gains a -4
 penalty but its Constitution gains a +4 bonus. The skitterhaunt's 
Wisdom and Charisma scores both drop to 1. A skitterhaunt is an ooze, 
and as such it does not have an Intelligence score.<br><b><br> Skills:</b> A skitterhaunt loses all the skills it had as a vermin and gains no new ones.<br><b><br> Feats: </b>A skitterhaunt loses any feats it had as a vermin and gains no new ones.<br><b><br> Climate/Terrain:</b> Any underground.<br><b><br> Organization:</b> Solitary.<br><b><br> Challenge Rating: </b>Same as the base creature +1.<br><b><br> Alignment:</b> Always neutral.<br><b><br> Treasure:</b> None.<br><b><br> Advancement:</b> Same as the base creature.</p>
