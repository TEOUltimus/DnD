<p align="left"><img src="2003%20-%2012-27%20-%20Magic%20Items%20of%20the%20Volcano_files/volcano.jpg" alt="Urborg Volcano - Tony Szczudlo" title="Urborg Volcano - Tony Szczudlo" border="1" align="right" height="131" width="179">Just
 as the power of the volcano can be harnessed to create powerful and 
destructive spells, it can be captured or duplicated with potent magic 
items. These items, with the notable exception of the <i>boots of lavawalking</i>,
 are universally destructive and devastating. Volcano-worshiping 
cultists often carry items like those presented here, and many of them 
can serve as the basis for deadly traps. A <i>bottled eruption</i> 
balanced on top of a partially opened door can make a thunderous 
surprise for an intruder. Likewise, a large container of gravel or sand 
perched above a <i>volcano seed</i> makes a horribly simple and 
destructive trap, although this kind of trap isn't recommended for those
 who wish to preserve the surrounding environs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Boots of Lavawalking: </b>These black and red leather
 boots are stiff and somewhat uncomfortable to wear. The soles of the 
boots are made of some sort of strange, red, glasslike substance that is
 much stronger than steel yet still somewhat flexible. <i>Boots of lavawalking</i>
 allow the wearer to walk over liquid surfaces such as water. The boots 
also grant fire resistance 20, which is enough to allow the wearer to 
ignore damage from contact with lava and therefore allowing the wearer 
to tread upon molten rock with comfort and ease.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>resist energy</i>, <i>water walk</i>; Price 57,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bottled Eruption:</b> A <i>bottled eruption</i> looks
 like a large bottle made of thick, clouded glass and stoppered with 
gritty, gray wax. The bottle contains the magically captured sounds of a
 volcanic eruption. The eruption can be released in one of two ways: by 
opening the bottle or by smashing the bottle. If the bottle is opened 
(requiring a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity), 
the stored sound is emitted as a 60-foot cone of sonic energy that the 
wielder can aim. If the bottle is smashed (requiring a standard action 
that does not provoke an attack of opportunity), the stored sound is 
emitted as a 20-foot burst of sonic energy centered on the wielder. A <i>bottled eruption</i>
 can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10; if it 
hits a solid surface at any time it must make a Fortitude save (DC 10) 
as an unattended object (Fortitude save +2 +1/2 caster level) to avoid 
being destroyed and releasing its eruption.</p>
<p align="left">Although the sound released by a <i>bottled eruption</i>
 when it is opened or smashed is thunderously loud (DC -40 to hear with a
 Listen Check; thus, at a range of 400 feet the Listen check to hear the
 explosion is DC 0), only those in the cone or burst area suffer the 
full effects. All such creatures must make two successful Fortitude 
saves (DC 17). If both saving throws are failed, a creature becomes 
permanently deafened and is both knocked prone and stunned for 1d6 
rounds. Creatures that make one of the saving throws are merely deafened
 for 1 minute and knocked prone. Creatures that make both saving throws 
are deafened for 1 round.</p>
<p align="left">Once a <i>bottled eruption</i> is opened and the sound within escapes, it becomes a nonmagic item.</p>
<p align="left">Strong evocation; CL 16th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>greater shout</i>, <i>sculpt sound</i>; Price 4,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lavalash:</b> A <i>lavalash</i> is a <i>+1 flaming burst whip</i> that seems to be made of a thin strand of molten lava. The handle of the <i>whip</i> is made of obsidian and remains cool to the touch. Although the <i>lavalash's</i> base damage deals nonlethal damage as a normal <i>+1 whip</i>, the additional fire damage can hurt creatures normally.</p>
<p align="left">Three times per day you can cause the strand of lava to 
detach from the handle as you attack with it. This allows you to make a 
single ranged touch attack against any target within 60 feet. If you 
hit, the strand of lava wraps around the target and inflicts standard 
damage. Additionally, the <i>whip</i> can immediately make a free 
grapple check to wrap around the target; the whip attacks as though you 
were making the grapple check against the target. If the whip gets a 
hold, it holds the target immobile and inflicts 2d6 points of fire 
damage each round it maintains the hold. The strand of lava fades away 
into nothingness if it ever fails a grapple check, or after 6 rounds 
pass.</p>
<p align="left">Strong evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>entangle</i>, <i>flame blade, flamestrike</i>; Price 47,000 gp; Cost 23,701 + 301 XP.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stonemelt Powder:</b> Pouches of <i>stonemelt powder</i>
 typically come in obsidian containers that hold five applications of 
the magic dust, although smaller and larger containers are not unheard 
of. <i>Stonemelt powder</i> is quite heavy and granular, and it is warm 
to the touch. A single dose of the powder can be spread over a 
5-foot-square area; applying the powder is a standard action that does 
not provoke an attack of opportunity. The user can apply the powder to 
any square she threatens.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Stonemelt powder</i> is useless unless it is placed 
upon a stone surface (either worked or natural). One round after the 
powder is placed, it bonds with the stone and causes it to melt rapidly,
 but not instantly, into lava. All creatures in the affected area are 
allowed a Reflex saving throw (DC 22) to reach safety before the lava 
fully forms, provided they also move out of the area. These creatures 
take 2d6 points of fire damage. For the next 1d3 rounds they take 1d6 
points of fire damage per round. A creature that fails its save or 
cannot flee becomes mired in the lava. Creatures mired in the lava sink 
until hip- or chest-deep, reducing their speed to 5 feet and giving them
 -2 penalties on attack rolls and AC. Creatures large enough to walk on 
the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet. Any creature 
mired in the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage per round. This 
damage continues for an additional 1d3 rounds once the creature is free 
of the lava, but the damage is halved (10d6 points of fire damage per 
round).</p>
<p align="left">If a dose of <i>stonemelt powder</i> is cast upon the 
ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the resulting lava falls to the floor and
 spreads out in a pool with a depth of 5 feet. The falling lava and the 
ensuing cave-in deal 2d6 points of fire and 8d6 points of bludgeoning 
points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half 
damage to those who succeed at Reflex saves (DC 22). For 1d3 rounds 
after this, creatures that made their saving throw take 1d6 points of 
fire damage per round until the lava cools. Creatures that fail this 
saving throw become mired in the lava as detailed above.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Stonemelt powder</i> can horribly damage stone 
creatures or objects of Large or smaller size. The creature or object 
must make a Fortitude save (DC 22) when sprayed with <i>stonemelt powder</i>
 or take 20d6 points of fire damage per round for 1d3 rounds, starting 1
 round after the initial application. A successful Fortitude save halves
 this damage. Any creature in contact with or struck by the melting 
object or creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage.</p>
<p align="left">Lava created by <i>stonemelt powder</i> remains until a successful <i>dispel magic</i>
 restores its substance -- but not necessarily its form. Natural cooling
 causes the lava to turn to stone at the rate of 5 feet per 10 minutes, 
starting from the outer edge toward the center.</p>
<p align="left">Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>flamestrike</i> or <i>wall of fire, transmute rock to mud</i>; Price 9,000 gp per dose; Weight 5 lb. per dose.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Volcano Seed:</b> A <i>volcano seed</i> resembles a 
lump of polished obsidian the size and shape of a chicken egg. Warm to 
the touch, it is in fact a destructive magic item as rare as it is 
potent. A <i>volcano seed</i> is activated by simply burying it under a 
few inches of gravel, soil, sand, or other earthy substance on the 
ground. This is a full-round action that provokes an attack of 
opportunity. The user can set a delay for the seed's activation from 1 
round to 10 rounds after it is initially buried; after this time limit 
passes, the item triggers a <i>raise volcano</i> spell. A <i>volcano seed</i> works only once; it is consumed in the process of creating the volcano.</p>
<p align="left">Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>raise volcano</i>; Price 37,650 gp; Weight 5 lb.</p>
