 month, we take a look at another interesting far corner of the world. 
Whereas previous installments in this column explored deserts, jungles, 
mountains, and other remote locations, the "terrain" we focus on now is 
one that can appear anywhere in the remote reaches of your campaign 
world: the Lost City.</p>
<p align="left">Ruins of former empires, be they in the form of a 
sand-hidden necropolis, a frozen capital, or a jungle-cloaked theocracy,
 have been a staple of <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> since the 
beginning. Haunted by both the ancient legacies of their former masters 
and by newer denizens from the surrounding environs, lost cities can be 
set in any of the previous terrains and, as such, can give you ample 
opportunities to use any of the spells detailed in previous "Far Corners
 of the World" columns. Yet just like any other terrain, adventurers and
 explorers have developed specialized forms of magic to help cope with 
the unique dangers and situations that might arise during the 
exploration of these ancient places, or alternatively, capitalize on the
 unique terrain to create dangerous effects.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expeditious Excavation<br></b>Transmutation [Earth]<br><b>Level:</b> Sorcerer/Wizard 7<br><b>Components: </b>V, S, M, F<br><b>Casting Time: </b>1 minute<br><b>Range: </b>Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> One opening, up to 10-foot-cube/level (S)<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level (D), see text<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None or Reflex negates (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance: </b>No</p>
<p align="left">A wizard named Kiolimar originally developed this spell.
 Frustrated after having one too many times been stymied by collapsed 
passageways or rubble-filled rooms while on his expeditions to a lost 
city to accumulate lore on the secrets of the ancients, he began using <i>telekinesis</i>
 to quickly move aside the rubble. Unfortunately, this method was still 
too slow for the impatient Kiolimar. His initial version of <i>expeditious excavation</i> used the fundamentals of <i>telekinesis</i>
 and magnified it greatly; with one spell, he could excavate entire 
hallways and chambers quickly, providing access to rooms beyond. 
Kiolimar shared his spell with his apprentices, otherwise it, like him, 
would have been lost the day the tunnels he excavated suddenly collapsed
 on him, burying him in a vault of the lore he so dearly coveted.</p>
<p align="left">When this spell is cast, powerful telekinetic forces 
take hold of all loose rubble, stone, and earth in a space up to one 
10-foot-cube per caster level. These forces push aside the stone and 
rubble, rebuilding the stone walls and floors and ceilings of the 
collapsed chambers and then holding the rebuilt room sound and true for 
the spell's duration. Non-earth or stone objects and creatures are 
unaffected; an <i>expeditious excavation</i> is a highly efficient 
method of recovering buried objects or allies. The telekinetic magic has
 no effect on solid tone or metal, but it can be used to dig a stable 
tunnel through gravel, sand, earth, mud, or soil. This spell has no 
power to restore anything of artistic or scholarly value to a collapsed 
wall; if a chamber's collapsed walls once held beautiful bas-reliefs and
 inscriptions, the images and words are not restored by this spell.</p>
<p align="left">After the spell's duration, the telekinetic forces that 
hold the room together vanish, and the room collapses back into rubble 
in 1 round. Any creatures in the room when it is collapsing must each 
immediately make a Reflex save. If successful, the character must still 
use whatever means possible to escape the collapsing area; if she cannot
 escape the area in 1 round, she automatically fails her Reflex save. A 
failed Reflex save indicates the character becomes pinned and completely
 buried in the rubble as it fills in the area in a cacophonous crash. 
This inflicts 8d6 points of damage and buries the creature. Buried 
creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. 
If such a character falls unconscious, he must make a DC 15 Constitution
 check. If it fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute 
thereafter until freed or dead. Canny wizards have been known to use 
this spell to create escape routes, and then dismiss the spell to bury 
their pursuers.</p>
<p align="left">This spell's effects can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component</i>: 500 gp worth of diamond dust.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Focus: </i>A miniature platinum pickaxe worth 500 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghost Storm<br></b>Necromancy [Death]<br><b>Level:</b> Cleric 5, Sorcerer/Wizard 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> 30-ft.-radius spread<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">One thing the lost cities share, despite their diverse 
locations, is a history of loss and despair. Had no tragedy occurred, 
the city would have remained vibrant. Yet something -- some terrible 
fate, be it plague, disaster, war, madness, or worse -- befell the 
ancient citizens of the now empty city, and an echo or remnant of their 
final hours is firmly imprinted in what ruined stones still remain in 
their one-time homes.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Ghost storm</i> calls upon the residual energies of 
anguish, fear, terror, and despair embedded in the stones of the region 
and magnifies them to a terrifying degree. As the spell is cast, dozens 
of wrathful, shrieking spirits rise out of the ground and ruined walls 
of the surroundings, filling the area with a whirling storm of 
wretchedness and agony. As the spirits move around and through any 
creatures caught in the area, their anguish and pain is transferred to 
any living creatures in the area.</p>
<p align="left">All living creatures in a <i>ghost storm</i> who make a 
Fortitude save simply become shaken for 1 round. A new saving throw is 
required each round the creature stays in the <i>ghost storm</i>. Living
 creatures that fail this saving throw flail and claw at the ghosts in a
 hopeless attempt to prevent the spirits from assaulting them. The only 
action such a creature can take is a single move action per turn, and 
the creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any). Worse, 
the unhealthy contact with the necromantic spirits of a <i>ghost storm</i> inflict one negative level for each failed Fortitude save. Negative levels imparted by a <i>ghost storm</i> fade at the rate of one per minute once a character exits the <i>ghost storm</i>
 area; no saving throw is required to remove negative levels gained from
 this spell, but otherwise the negative levels have their normal effects
 (see the Glossary). Any creature who gains negative levels equal to his
 Hit Dice is immediately slain.</p>
<p align="left">Once created, a <i>ghost storm</i> remains stationary. A
 creature that enters the area must immediately save against its 
effects, even if he has already made a previous saving throw against the
 same spell.</p>
<p align="left">This spell is far less effective in areas other than 
lost cities (a "city" is a community with a population 5,000; see page 
137 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). If the spell is cast in a location where a city never existed, the ghosts produced fill only a single 10-foot square.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hide the Path<br></b>Abjuration<br><b>Level:</b> Bard 6, Cleric 7, Druid 7<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br><b>Range:</b> Anywhere in the area to be warded<br><b>Area:</b> 60-ft. cube/level (S)<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 day<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">Denizens of the lost city understand that their lairs 
carry a unique mystique that beckons adventurers and explorers like 
flies to a carcass. Many use their magic or skills (or the magic and 
skills of their minions and slaves) to erect defenses, traps, secret 
doors, and other methods of protecting their lairs from intrusion. To 
these creatures, one spell is more dangerous than an entire legion of 
soldiers: <i>find the path</i>.</p>
<p align="left">With this one spell, a party of adventurers can quickly 
and easily divine the safest, most direct route to a destination (often 
the lair of the creature in question). The response to this threat is <i>hide the path,</i> an equally potent (though much rarer) spell. <i>Hide the path</i> wards a large, continuous area with powerful abjuration magic that specifically defeats the <i>find the path </i>spell; this spell simply won't function in an area warded by <i>hide the path</i>. Yet the effects of <i>hide the path</i> extend beyond this simple (but valuable) effect.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Hide the path </i>also interferes with other 
divination spells of 6th level or less. When casting or aiming such a 
spell within the area warded by <i>hide the path,</i> the spellcaster 
must make a caster level check with a bonus equal to the divination 
spell's level (1d20+caster level plus divination spell level against a 
DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast the <i>hide the path</i>
 spell). If the check fails, the divination spell reveals nothing, but 
is not dispelled and the caster can try again if the divination spell's 
duration allows.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Focus</i>: A 6-inch onyx sphere mounted upon an 
obsidian stand; the entire focus must be worth no less than 1,000 gp. 
Any creature in physical contact with the focus may cast divination 
spells without restriction from the <i>hide the path</i> effect. If the focus is destroyed or brought beyond the boundaries of the <i>hide the path</i> effect, the spell is immediately dismissed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ruin Delver's Fortune<br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Bard 4<br><b>Components: </b>V<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 free action<br><b>Range:</b> Personal<br><b>Target:</b> You<br><b>Duration:</b> 1d4 rounds</p>
<p align="left">More than other classes, bards are drawn by the 
mysteries and allure promised by the lost city. The thrill of 
discovering a forgotten civilization, of defeating strange and unusual 
monsters, of surviving perilous and deadly traps, and of restoring 
ancient legends from bygone ages are what the best of the epic bard 
tales are built on. Yet the field research into these areas can be quite
 dangerous. Bards who make their living on discovery and exploration 
often take pains to learn <i>ruin delver's fortune</i> as soon as possible, for it can often make the difference between life or death.</p>
<p align="left">You can cast<i> ruin delver's fortune </i>as a free 
action, even when it's not your turn. Casting this spell counts toward 
the limit of one quickened spell per round. When the spell is cast, you 
call upon your hidden reserve of skill and love of life to enhance your 
abilities for a short period to cope with sudden peril. Choose from one 
of the following effects when you cast the spell. Once chosen, the 
effect cannot be changed for the duration of the spell. The benefits 
granted by <i>ruin delver's fortune</i> are fleeting, but often the benefits granted are just enough to get you out of a tight spot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain an insight bonus on Fortitude saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier; also gain immunity to poison.</li>
<li>Gain an insight bonus on Reflex saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier; also gain the evasion class ability.</li>
<li>Gain an insight bonus on Will saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier; also gain immunity to fear effects.</li>
<li>Cure 2d8 + your Charisma modifier hit points of damage.</li>
<li>Gain spell resistance equal to your bard level + your Charisma modifier.</li>
<li>Gain an insight bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Once the spell's duration expires, the surge of energy and skill vanishes, leaving you hollow and depressed. You become <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fatigued')">fatigued</a> (see Glossary) unless you make a successful DC 15 Constitution check.</p>
