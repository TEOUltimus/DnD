 Far Corners of the World has traditionally turned its eye upon the 
remote corners of wilderness far from civilization. For this 
installment, however, we look not to the horizon, but up. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Just as the steaming jungles and frozen glaciers have 
magic and creatures of their own, the skies above are far from empty. 
Even beyond the classic myth of the castle in the clouds, plenty of 
reasons exist to explore the upper limits of the firmament. The 
celestial bodies have always held a fascination for terrestrial 
creatures; what exactly are they? What is it like to stand upon the 
moon? What exactly is the nature of a star? These questions have driven 
spellcasters to extremes in researching new magic, and much to their 
delight, they find that magic sometimes awaits them above the highest 
cloud and beyond the deepest blue -- wondrous discoveries from the 
hidden realm above.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cloud Spear<br></b>Evocation [Air]<br><b>Level:</b> Druid 4<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF<br><b>Casting Time: </b>1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> 0 ft.<br><b>Effect:</b> Spearlike beam of moonlight<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude partial, see text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT">A shaft of roiling white vapor extends from your hand. 
You handle this beam almost as is if wielding a spear (gaining the 
benefit of any feats that apply, such as Weapon Focus or Improved 
Critical). Attacks you make with the cloud spear are melee touch 
attacks. The cloud spear cannot leave your hand while the spell lasts. A
 cloud spear deals 1d8 points of piercing damage on a successful hit, +1
 per two caster levels (maximum of +7). Since the spear is immaterial, 
your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. Any creature that 
takes damage from a cloud spear must make a Fortitude save to resist 
being transformed into white vapor for 1 round. A creature so 
transformed is treated as if under the effects of a <i>gaseous form</i> spell, but cannot move or voluntarily return to solid form.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Creatures with the Earth subtype take 2d6 points of damage, +1 point of damage per caster level (maximum of +15) when hit by a <i>cloud spear</i>, and they take a-2 penalty on saves against the gaseous form effect.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skyhurling<br></b>Transmutation<br><b>Level:</b> Druid 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> A Large or smaller creature<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Fortitude negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT">You envelop the target creature in a globe of wind and 
fog and then hurl it violently into the air. You determine where the 
creature lands, although the landing point must be within the spell's 
range. The maximum height the victim's flight reaches is equal to 5 feet
 per caster level, otherwise, the caster chooses the height when casting
 the spell. When the victim lands, it takes the appropriate amount of 
falling damage as set by this maximum height.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Creatures may take incidental damage from objects in the
 path of their trajectory, such as tree branches, flimsy roofs, or other
 yielding barriers. If this is the case, the victim takes an extra 2d6 
points of damage in addition to the standard falling damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A creature that would strike an unyielding surface 
before it reaches the height of its upward fall cannot be targeted by 
this spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Rather than hurl targets into the air, you can use this 
spell to hurl airborne creatures to the ground. The targeted creature 
must be within 5 feet/level of the ground, and, if it fails to resist 
the spell, it is hurled to the ground and takes damage as if it had 
fallen from the appropriate height.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you cast this spell outside and the victim does not 
encounter any yielding barriers during his upward fall, the maximum 
height reached is doubled (10 ft./caster level).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skyrift<br></b>Illusion (Shadow)<br><b>Level:</b> Sorcerer/Wizard 9<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M, F, XP<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Area:</b> One mile radius<br><b>Duration:</b> Permanent<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance: </b>No</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Skyrift</i> cloaks a large circular region with a 
radius of one mile in eternal night. The focal point of this region must
 be an obsidian stele of at least 10 feet in height carved with arcane 
runes by the caster. Once the spell is cast, the sun never seems to rise
 in the region. The affected area is either dark or lit with shadowy 
light, depending on the conditions outside. For example, the area has 
shadowy light when the sun is up on a clear day. Artificial light 
sources work normally within the affected area. Creatures and magical 
effects that rely upon night to work can function at all times in an 
area that a <i>skyrift</i> cloaks. Likewise, beings and objects that sunlight harms can exist with comfort anywhere in a <i>skyrift</i> at any time of day.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This spell may be cast in outdoor areas only, although 
its area can contain structures provided they are wholly within the area
 affected. Viewed from outside, a region blanketed under a <i>skyrift</i> seems to be dark and gloomy, as if on an overcast day late in the afternoon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Material Component</i>: A scepter of onyx and obsidian worth no less than 5,000 gp which must be broken upon the face of the spell's focus.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Focus</i>: An obsidian stele. Preparing the stele takes one week and costs 2,500 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>XP Cost</i>: 500 XP.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Storm Prison<br></b>Evocation (Air) [Electricity]<br><b>Level:</b> Sorcerer/Wizard 6<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. +40 ft./level)<br><b> Target:</b> One creature or object<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT">A sphere of crackling energy shoots out of your 
outstretched hand to strike a single creature or object. The ball of 
lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level 
(maximum 15d6) to the creature struck, and then encases the creature or 
object struck in a sphere of lightning and powerful wind. A successful 
Reflex save halves the damage done and allows the target to escape being
 caught; in this case the spell's duration ends immediately.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the target fails its Reflex save, it becomes trapped 
in the resulting sphere. The creature floats in the center of the 
sphere, held in place by the powerful wind. Projectiles cannot pass into
 or out of the sphere. A creature caught in the sphere must make a 
successful DC 20 Concentration check to cast a spell. Any creature that 
comes within 10 feet of the trapped creature immediately takes 3d6 
points of electricity damage (a successful Reflex save halves this 
damage).</p>
<p align="LEFT">As a standard action, you can move the sphere by mental 
will to the limit of the spell's range. The sphere moves at a fly speed 
of 30 feet (perfect). You can attempt to bull rush or overrun a creature
 with the sphere. It has an effective Strength score of 20 and Large 
size, for determining the modifiers to the attempt. Any creature 
successfully bull rushed or overrun with the sphere takes 3d6 points of 
electricity damage (Reflex save half). If the sphere is empty, a 
creature that fails this Reflex save also becomes trapped in the <i>storm prison</i>. A creature inside a <i>storm prison</i>
 as it is moved suffers no ill effects from any regions or hazardous 
areas you move the prison into, since the powerful winds and electricity
 around the creature shield it. Once the spell ends, though, this 
protection ends as well. If the creature was in the air at the time, it 
falls for the appropriate amount of falling damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You cannot cause a <i>storm prison</i> to move through water or other liquids.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vertigo<br></b>Illusion (Phantasm)<br><b>Level:</b> Bard 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Target:</b> One creature<br><b>Duration: </b>1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw: </b>Will partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="LEFT">With this spell, you attempt to fill the target's mind 
with the inescapable sensation of being perched over a terrible 
precipice. If the victim makes its Will save to avoid the effects of the
 spell, it merely experiences a brief bout of vertigo for no apparent 
reason and takes a -2 penalty on Balance checks, Jump checks, and Reflex
 saving throws for 1 round.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the victim fails to resist the spell, it perceives 
that the surroundings change suddenly and become horrifyingly 
vertiginous. A person standing in an open field may suddenly believe 
that the ground has fallen away save for a narrow pinnacle upon which 
she stands. A victim on a ship may suddenly see a massive waterfall 
nearby and believe his ship balances on the edge of it. A target in the 
air may see the ground below drop away at a dizzying speed, or perhaps 
rush up toward her. In any case, the victim realizes that to move from 
its position is to invite certain doom. A victim that can fly believes 
that for some reason its ability to fly has failed; perhaps it believes 
its wings have vanished, as an example. It also takes a -4 penalty on 
all Dexterity-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, and Reflex saving
 throws, and it is considered flat-footed. The victim is not otherwise 
helpless, and it can act to attack or defend itself; the victim 
perceives other creatures nearby as suddenly being able to fly or walk 
on the air, if necessary.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A victim of <i>vertigo</i> is not physically prevented 
from moving, though. The creature can, at any time, choose to step off 
its perch and into the perceived abyss, at which point it is filled with
 the sensation of falling for 1 round before it hits the cold unyielding
 ground. At this point, the victim can make a second Will saving throw 
against the spell, but this time at a -2 penalty. Success means the 
victim is dazed for the remainder of the round. Failure indicates that 
the victim takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level 
(maximum 10d6) as it perceives itself to strike the ground with terrible
 force. The next round, the victim may save against this spell again (at
 normal chances). Success indicates the spell's effects end, but failure
 indicates that the victim believes it has in fact landed on yet another
 horrifying perch over an abyss.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A victim that is bull rushed or otherwise forced to move is treated as if it moved voluntarily.</p>
