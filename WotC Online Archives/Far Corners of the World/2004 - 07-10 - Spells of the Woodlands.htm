 druids epitomize nature and venerate it in all its incarnations, there 
nevertheless remains one type of terrain that seems to hold special 
secrets and hidden power for them: the woodlands. Likewise, the majestic
 forests of the world often serve as the haunt of mysterious and often 
quite powerful fey creatures who command impressive magic. Dryads, 
nymphs, and satyrs are only a few such creatures. The fey and druids of 
the woodlands have always known that a special magic hides in the roots 
below and canopy above, and sometimes, they see fit to gift this magic 
upon particularly favored allies from outside the wooded ways. Those so 
gifted keep these spells as honored treasures, or they become coveted 
trophies by those foul enough to steal them for their own.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Acorn of Far Travel<br></b>Transmutation<b><br></b><b>Level:</b> Druid 2, Ranger 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute<br><b>Range:</b> Touch<br><b>Target:</b> One acorn<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 day/level or until expended<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left"><i>Acorn of far travel</i> must be cast upon an acorn 
that is still attached to a living oak tree. As you cast the spell, the 
spirit of the oak tree wells into the acorn, which detaches into your 
hand once the casting is complete. As long as you carry the acorn (and 
as long as the acorn is not stored in an extradimensional space like a <i>bag of holding</i>),
 you are considered to be standing under that oak tree's canopy (and 
thus within an area of forested terrain). Whenever you cast a spell that
 has additional effects when cast in forested terrain (such as <i>deadfall</i>, <i>creaking cacophony</i>, <i>fey ring</i>, or <i>splinterbolt</i>),
 you can choose to use the acorn as an additional material component for
 that spell. Doing so consumes the acorn immediately, but the spell's 
effects manifest as if you stood in forested terrain no matter what your
 actual location. Likewise, you can use the acorn as an oak tree for 
spells like <i>tree stride </i>or <i>transport via plants;</i> this also consumes the acorn. </p>
<p align="left">Dryads gain an additional benefit from this spell. If a 
dryad spellcaster casts this spell on an acorn harvested from her bonded
 oak tree, she is considered to be in contact with her tree at all 
times, despite the actual distance between her and the tree. A dryad 
spellcaster can thus use this spell to travel great distances from her 
tree without growing sick.</p>
<p align="left">You can have only one <i>acorn of far travel</i> spell in effect at any one time. If you cast it more than once, any <i>acorn of far travel</i>
 spells you may have already in effect immediately end. The magic of the
 spell is not bonded to you, though. You can pass the infused acorn to 
others, allowing them to gain the benefits of this spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component:</i> A fallen leaf taken from the oak tree from which the acorn is to be harvested.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creaking Cacophony<br></b>Illusion (Figment) [Sonic]<br><b>Level:</b> Bard 3, Druid 3, Sorcerer/Wizard 4<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Area:</b> 40-ft.-radius spread<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 round/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will partial<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left"><i>Creaking cacophony</i> fills the area with a 
cacophonous din, as if of hundreds of intertwined trees and branches 
rubbing and creaking together in a chaotic melody of groans and creaks. 
The sound from the spell is as loud as a pitched battle and is audible 
far beyond the spell's area. Outside the spell's area, the sound is 
merely loud. Inside the spell's area the sound is overwhelming and 
maddening. All creatures in the area that can hear must make a Will 
saving throw each round or become both deafened and shaken for the 
duration of the spell, even if they subsequently leave the spell's area.
 Those who successfully save against the spell merely suffer a -4 
penalty on Listen checks while they're within the spell's area. All 
creatures in the area gain vulnerability to sonic damage and take 150% 
normal damage from any attack that deals sonic damage as the <i>creaking cacophony</i> enhances and focuses the energy.</p>
<p align="left">If this spell is cast in a forested area, saving throws 
to resist its deafness and shaken effects suffer a -2 penalty and the 
spell's duration is doubled.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Deadfall<br></b>Conjuration (Creation)<br><b>Level:</b> Druid 8<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> Mass of dead wood forming in a cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high) (see text)<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous (see text)<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Reflex partial (see text)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">Deadfall creates a tangled mass of huge branches, logs, 
and fallen trees on the ground. The deadfall immediately collapses in on
 itself with terrific force and noise. Creatures and objects in the area
 take 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage per caster level. A successful 
Reflex save halves the damage done. Creatures that fail the Reflex save 
not only suffer full damage, but are knocked prone as well.</p>
<p align="left">Once you cast the spell, a considerable volume of dead 
wood remains behind. This pile of brush is 5 feet high, with a 20-foot 
radius. It costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square the pile 
covers. Tumble and Move Silently check DCs increase by +2, and running 
or charging through the pile is impossible. The deadall provides soft 
cover.</p>
<p align="left">If cast in a forested area, the damage done is at +1 per
 die, and creatures that fail the Reflex save must also make a Fortitude
 save or be stunned for 1 round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fey Ring<br></b>Conjuration (Calling) [See text]<br><b>Level:</b> Bard 6, Cleric 7, Druid 6, Sorcerer/Wizard 7<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, DF, XP<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> One called Medium or smaller fey<br><b>Duration:</b> See text<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> See text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left">By casting this spell, you cause a 5-foot-diameter ring 
of pale mushrooms to sprout from the ground. As soon as the spell is 
cast, a fey of your choice appears within the ring of mushrooms. The fey
 called is an average specimen, unless you know the name of a specific 
fey, in which case you can try to call upon that specific fey instead. 
If you call on a specific fey, it gains a Will save to resist the spell.
 A nonspecific fey does not gain a save to resist.</p>
<p align="left">Once called, the fey's initial attitude depends on how 
different its alignment is from yours. If its alignment is identical to 
yours, it is friendly. If one component is different, it is indifferent.
 If both components are different, it is unfriendly. If the fey's 
alignment is opposite your own, it is hostile. When the fey appears, you
 immediately make an opposed Diplomacy or an Intimidate check. The DM 
makes the check secretly, and the check's result determines how the 
fey's attitude is adjusted for purposes of the spell's outcome. The 
result of the check plays out over the course of the next minute (or 
less) as noted below.</p>
<p align="left">A hostile fey immediately attacks the caster (the fey 
acts as soon as the spell is complete). In this case, the fey ring 
itself withers into black sludge. Normally an attempt to influence a 
creature's attitude takes 1 minute, but you can break off the 
negotiation and take other actions beginning with your next turn after 
completing the spell.</p>
<p align="left">An unfriendly fey mocks and insults the caster for 1 
minute before returning from whence it came. During this time, you 
cannot act, because you are assumed to be attempting to sway the fey's 
attitude with your Diplomacy or Intimidate check. The fey cannot leave 
the confines of the fey ring unless it is attacked, in which case the 
fey ring withers as detailed above. If someone attacks the fey, you can 
break off the negotiation and take other actions beginning with your 
next turn after the fey was attacked.</p>
<p align="left">An indifferent fey answers 1d6 questions posed to it by you before it is released from the <i>fey ring</i>
 after 1 minute. It is under no compulsion to tell the truth, but it 
generally doesn't lie if it has no reason to do so. During the 1 minute 
the fey remains in the ring, you cannot act, because you are assumed to 
be attempting to sway the fey's attitude with your Diplomacy or 
Intimidate check. The questions you ask are assumed to be part of your 
actions you use to change the fey's attitude.</p>
<p align="left">A friendly fey agrees to serve you in any relatively 
safe endeavor for up to 1 hour per caster level. It answers questions, 
serves as a guide, casts helpful spells, and otherwise assists you as 
you desire, as long as what assistance you require is not dangerous or 
abhorrent to the fey. You must complete your attempt to change the fey's
 attitude before the service commences.</p>
<p align="left">A helpful fey agrees to serve you in the same manner as a
 friendly fey, save that it fights to defend you and takes unnecessary 
risks to assist you as you require, for up to 1 hour per caster level. 
You must complete your attempt to change the fey's attitude before the 
service commences.</p>
<p align="left">Instead of spending 1 minute changing the fey's attitude
 with a Diplomacy or Intimidate check, you can do so as a full-round 
action. If you do so, you take a -10 penalty on the check. Determine the
 check result and then determine what the fey does next. A hostile fey 
attacks. An unfriendly fey mocks the caster for 1 minute. An indifferent
 fey answers 1d6 questions over the course of as much as 1 minute; 
asking the fey questions is a free action for you. A friendly or helpful
 fey serves you as noted above.</p>
<p align="left">The <i>fey ring</i> itself remains in effect as long as the fey serves you. If you ever harm or betray the fey, the <i>fey ring</i> immediately melts away and the fey goes free to do what it will; it can return to where it came from via <i>teleportation</i>
 for up to 1 minute after the fey ring melts, after which the fey 
remains stuck in the area and must return home under its own power.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot call a fey that has more Hit Dice than you 
do. When you use this spell to call a fey with the air, chaotic, earth, 
evil, fire, good, lawful, or water subtype, the spell is a spell of that
 type.</p>
<p align="left"><i>XP Cost</i>: 500 XP. If you cast this spell in a 
forested area, you can substitute 2,000 gp worth of magic items as a 
material component in place of the XP cost.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Splinterbolt<br></b>Evocation<br><b>Level:</b> Druid 2, Sorcerer/Wizard 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Effect:</b> One or more streams of splinters<br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">You cause a long, thin, sharp beam of splinters to lance
 out of your outstretched hand to strike a target in range. You must 
make a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) to hit the target; if 
you hit, the splinterbolt deals 4d6 points of piercing damage. The 
splinterbolt threatens a critical hit on an 18-20 and deals x3 damage on
 a successful critical hit.</p>
<p align="left">You can fire one additional splinterbolt for every four 
levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three splinterbolts at 11th level). 
You can fire these splinterbolts at the same or different targets, but 
all splinterbolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other 
and fired simultaneously.</p>
<p align="left">If you cast this spell in forested terrain, the 
splinterbolts are treated as cold iron magic weapons, and they deal an 
additional +4 points of damage on a hit.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component</i>: A splinter of wood.</p>
