exhausted every incantation she knew and every spell her research had 
uncovered, to no avail. The smooth slab was as mysterious as when she 
had first discovered it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She stopped and slammed her fist against the unyielding 
slab. "'Cobalt mystery' indeed!" she cried out, her voice startling a 
buzzard that had landed nearby so it took to the air and circled with 
its companions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Again she repeated the words she had first heard from the lips of the blind oracle at Zhordan:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Behold the Wellspring's hallowed gate<br></i><i>Through which all souls in birth and death<br></i><i>Must pass for good or ill. The fate<br></i><i>Of all who now draw breath,<br></i><i>Who once have lived, who yet will be,<br></i><i>Is bound in cobalt mystery.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">As always, the recitation of the words had no effect 
that she could discern, and she turned away from the monolith in a fury,
 staring out at the distant horizon as if searching for some 
inspiration.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Her magic had shown her the ceaseless passage through 
the gate described in the verse: souls entering the world to take flesh 
in birth, and souls freed from their incarnation departing for their 
eternal rewards. That much she understood: This Wellspring was the one 
point in the world through which souls could pass. Had her inclinations 
been different, she was sure she could amass great power here by finding
 a way to harvest the souls in their passage and use them for foul ends.
 She had already killed one necromancer who had come to the Wellspring 
with that purpose in mind -- killed him and watched his soul disappear 
into the mute blue stone.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But something more was here, Thiera could feel it. This 
was the reason she was still alive and healthy, even though her 
great-grandchildren were stooped and gray. That much the Zhordanian 
oracle had told her. This monolith was tied to her destiny.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But what was she supposed to do?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Months spent in this forsaken desert had not revealed 
the answer to that question. Still, she'd keep trying to discover the 
answer. She sank to the ground, leaning her back against the monolith 
and gazing blindly out over the endless sands. The cobalt stone was cool
 to the touch, and seemed to sustain her -- it quenched her thirst and 
sated her hunger, removed the weariness from her bones.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But it did nothing for her heart.</p>
<hr>
<p align="LEFT">The travelers had closed in before they registered on 
Thiera's senses -- a ragtag line of people on foot leading pack camels 
across the sand, right toward the monolith. Thiera jumped to her feet 
and watched them draw nearer, trying to judge whether she would have to 
kill them as well. None of them looked like a necromancer -- in fact, 
the tall warrior at the front of the line looked like he might be a 
paladin, which reassured Thiera slightly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the leader came within shouting distance, he held 
up his hand to halt his companions, some of whom looked as surprised to 
see Thiera as she had been to notice them a moment before. She tried not
 to look threatening, though she had prepared her mind to rain death 
upon them if the need arose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The warrior called to her. He held his hands open and 
high, though she could see the greatsword slung on his back. "Are you 
the guardian of the Wellspring?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">The guardian? Thiera's mind spun. Until that moment, she
 had assumed that the monolith held some secret that she was supposed to
 uncover, that it would somehow reveal her destiny to her and then 
release her to pursue it. It had never crossed her mind that her 
presence here in this place was her destiny.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But it made sense. In fact, she had accepted the role of
 guardian without being conscious of it -- that was why she had killed 
the necromantic interloper without a second thought. And in his oblique 
way, the oracle had said as much, though of course she hadn't understood
 until now.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She had assumed the Wellspring was a stop along the way 
of a greater journey. She looked around, not sure that this was where 
she wanted to spend the rest of what had already been an unnaturally 
long life.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She saw the warrior shift uncomfortably and remembered that she had not answered him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"I am," she replied. For better or worse, she added to 
herself. "What has brought you here?" She saw an elf in the party shift 
nervously, his hand almost settling on the hilt of his slender sword.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The leader looked back over his shoulder and spoke 
quietly to his companions. They intended to fight her, Thiera was 
certain. But why?</p>
<p align="LEFT">"We have come to open the Wellspring," the warrior 
called back to her. "I sense no evil in you, so I would not choose to do
 battle with you. But if you stand between us and our goal, we are 
prepared to use force to achieve it."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Open the Wellspring? Thiera turned her back on the 
intruders and gazed again at the monolith behind her, her mind racing. 
What would that do? It was a gate through which souls were freely 
passing -- was it not already open?</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Keep your weapons sheathed," she called back over her 
shoulder, then she turned around to face them again. "Before any 
fighting begins, let me hear why you have come."</p>
<p align="LEFT">The elf clearly suspected a trap. Rapier in hand -- 
Thiera supposed he had drawn it quietly while her back was turned -- he 
was whispering with the group's leader. Thiera watched the leader shake 
his head firmly, then begin to walk toward her. The rest of his party 
followed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A human woman in a loose shirt and tight pants followed 
close after the leader, either in complete agreement with his plan or 
too devoted to him to question it. A male dwarf in heavy armor came a 
few paces behind her, then a leather-clad human man with a longbow slung
 over his back, and finally the elf, hanging back uncertainly. They left
 their camels at a distance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"I am Madhan, Knight of the Chalice," the leader said as
 he drew closer. Thiera had heard of that knightly order -- they devoted
 themselves to fighting demons, she believed, which strengthened her 
original impression of Madhan as a paladin.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"I am Thiera," she replied, some part of her wishing 
that she had a title to add. "Guardian of the Wellspring," she blurted 
as an afterthought, though she still wasn't sure what that meant. Madhan
 smiled, and Thiera liked him instantly -- the warmth in his smile was 
utterly without scorn. She returned his smile before it occurred to her 
that her role as guardian might demand a more fearsome demeanor.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"My companions are Barak, champion of Moradin --" the 
dwarf nodded a small bow, "Danav of the Mistwood --" the archer bowed 
deeply, "Riel dar Manis --" Madhan indicated the elf, who only frowned, 
"and my oathsworn companion, Phina." The woman smiled and raised her 
hand slightly, but her smile lacked the warmth of her husband's. Was she
 jealous? Thiera smiled -- this woman couldn't possibly guess that five 
generations of her offspring had walked the earth.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"You are welcome here," Thiera said, smiling again at 
Madhan. "It is long since I have had any company save the souls passing 
through." She watched all their eyes shift from her to the Wellspring 
behind her, as if they expected to see what her magic sight had revealed
 to her: the continuous traffic of souls through the gate. "Will you sit
 with me and tell me why you have come?" She extended her hands to offer
 them seats on the blue sand beside the monolith.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Without hesitation, Madhan and Phina came over to sit 
close to Thiera, and the others moved to sit beside their leader -- all 
except Riel, the elf, who paced slowly outside their little circle 
without ever drawing too near the monolith. Barak produced a bulging 
waterskin and passed it to Madhan, who drank before passing it on. 
Thiera declined a drink -- no food or water had passed her lips in 
months, and she saw no reason to change that now.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Madhan took a second drink from the skin, wiped his 
mouth on the back of his hand, and began to speak. "I will get directly 
to the point. We believe that the world is in danger, facing a threat 
similar to the one that caused the establishment of the Wellspring. The 
Wellspring no longer serves its original purpose -- in fact, as long as 
it remains closed, the world has no defense against the demons that 
threaten it. We plan to open it once more, so the magic of incarnum can 
serve as a weapon against the soul demons."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2009-29%20-%20At%20the%20Wellspring_files/dx0929fict_wellspring.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="177" width="263">Thiera
 stared blankly at the knight. He clearly assumed that she knew far more
 than she did. As she opened her mouth to begin a stream of questions, 
though, she felt a stirring in the monolith behind her, and a series of 
visions sprang into her mind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She saw the world at war. Angels and demons dueled, 
wrestled, and tore at each other in the skies, in the seas, on 
mountaintops, and in canyons. The visions overwhelmed her senses, and 
she watched them unfold for a long moment. Then the details began to 
penetrate her swirling mind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An angel raising a sword of gleaming azure, the blade 
itself singing with the joy of a heavenly chorus as it bit deep into 
demon flesh. A spearhead of midnight blue, howling in madness and 
torment as it pierced an angel's wing. Armor, gleaming circlets, weapons
 of every shape and size, banners, cloaks -- all various shades of blue 
and all shaped, to Thiera's sight, from souls.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thiera's mind rebelled. To shape a weapon from souls? 
That was horrible -- as evil as whatever designs her dead necromancer 
visitor had planned. Even as the thought formed in her mind, however, 
the vision shifted. She saw the souls that formed an angel's breastplate
 crying out in torment as a demonic blade raked through them. And then 
she witnessed a process that must have taken years, perhaps centuries, 
but that passed before her eyes in an instant: The angels changed, 
warped by their evil works, until they were indistinguishable from the 
demons they fought.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In that instant, she understood. The mystery of the 
Wellspring was opened to her. The Wellspring had been established to 
prevent the evil those angels and demons had wrought in ages long past: 
Its purpose was to prevent the souls from being used as tools and fodder
 in their warfare. As long as the Wellspring stood intact, souls could 
pass from this world to the next, but their energy could not be 
harnessed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Her eyes flicked around at the blue that stained the 
sand, the cobalt sky, and the monolith at her back. The Wellspring was 
not perfect -- soul energy leaked around it, too plentiful to be 
contained. It seeped into the earth beneath her and filled the sky. In 
this one place, it was real enough to touch -- to shape, to mold.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Incarnum. The name formed in her mind and she spoke it, 
barely aloud. Souls given substance. But not souls -- just their 
residue, their imprint left in their passing. It was enough.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She focused her mind for a moment, heedless of the eyes 
fixed on her, and the blue sand began to stir. Tendrils of blue mist 
formed around her hand and extended from it, obeying her every mental 
command. A little more concentration, and the mist hardened into bright 
blue steel, a hefty warhammer in her hand. It thrummed with power and 
seemed to resonate with something deep in Thiera's own soul.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The elf, Riel, jumped back, his rapier springing back into his hand. "Madhan," he said in a low voice. "I told you . . ."</p>
<p align="LEFT">But the leader held up a hand and kept his seat beside 
Thiera. The others continued watching in amazement, though they shifted 
uneasily, ready to spring to their feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thiera stood slowly, and Madhan joined her, followed by 
the rest of his companions. "If the Wellspring is opened," she said, 
"this power will spread. What I do here will be possible anywhere, and 
all people -- not just those of good intention -- will be able to 
harness the magic of incarnum. It will be used for evil. And some will 
repeat the evils of old: Not content to work with incarnum, they will 
shape souls to do their bidding once more." She stared at Madhan, who 
returned her gaze without blinking. "Terrible evil will be done with 
this."</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Soul-consuming evil will overwhelm the world without it," Madhan said.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As if in response to his words, a low sound like a 
chorus of distant moans and howls erupted behind them, on the other side
 of the monolith. They whirled toward it and watched as a gateway sprang
 open in the empty air. Through the magic portal stepped a demonic 
warrior, eight feet tall, with purplish-red skin and monstrous curved 
horns, clad in midnight-blue armor covered with hundreds of tormented 
faces. His greatsword was the source of the sound -- it too was adorned 
with faces, their mouths open wide, and their screams and groans 
produced the ghostly chorus.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The noise grew louder as the sword cut through the air and sliced Riel dar Manis cleanly in half.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"This portal shall not be opened," the demon said, its 
voice like three men speaking at once. "Guardian of the Wellspring" -- 
he pointed his blade at Thiera -- "do your duty!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">Madhan did not hesitate, but leapt at the demon, his own
 greatsword springing into his hands with a blinding flash of silver 
light. Barak and Phina sent spells hurtling at their new foe, while 
Danav strung three arrows at once and shot them toward the demon's 
throat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thiera felt as though she were floating outside of time,
 watching the battle begin in agonizing slowness. She understood so much
 now that had been hidden from her, as though the Wellspring had awaited
 this moment to reveal it to her. Why? Why had it ignored her entreaties
 for months, only to reveal all its mysteries now?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because it wants to be opened, she thought. This race of
 demons wanted it to stay closed because they had somehow found a way 
around it. This fiend's sword and armor were clearly formed of souls in 
torment. So the Wellspring had failed and served no purpose now except 
preventing earth's defenders from harnessing the magic of incarnum for 
themselves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the demon had hoped to secure her aid by invoking her
 duty, he would shortly become sorely disappointed, she thought. Thiera 
drew more incarnum around her, forming an angelic body surrounding her 
own that lifted her into the air on cerulean wings. With the force of a 
divine avenger, she swooped down on the demonic warrior, swinging her 
incarnate warhammer mightily.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Power surged through Thiera's veins with her pounding pulse. This is why I am alive, she sang to herself, this is why I am here.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In a matter of seconds, the demon lay dead at her feet, 
and Madhan knelt beside her. Thiera was vaguely aware of Barak tending 
to a sorely wounded Danav, and of Phina watching her with a look of 
something like awe on her face. But she ignored them and turned one last
 time to face the Wellspring.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The mighty hammer in her hands hummed in exultation, echoing the triumph that filled her own heart.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"I have always been good," she said aloud, "but now I am
 more -- I am good made flesh, good incarnate. I have always fought for 
what is good, but now I will fight with weapons made from the desires 
and longings of all who share my convictions." She hefted the warhammer 
in her hands, then drew it back over her shoulder. "Let goodness 
prevail!" she cried, and swung the warhammer hard, crashing it into the 
Wellspring.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A great crack spread like thunder across the face of the
 monolith, and a bolt of lightning shot across the clear blue sky. 
Thiera drew back and swung again, then again -- two more peals of 
thunder, two more flashes of lightning, and then the Wellspring 
shattered.</p>
<p align="LEFT">First it fell inward, like a building caving in on 
itself, but quietly -- at least it seemed so after the deafening crashes
 of the blows Thiera had dealt it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But then a mighty roar of wind caused an explosion of 
sand and dust and swirling blue mist to erupt in all directions. Madhan 
threw his arms over his head, Phina screamed, and Barak tried to shield 
Danav's body, but Thiera stood unflinching in its full force.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It passed in an instant, and silence fell over the 
desert. The force of the blast had stripped the angelic avatar from 
around her and made the warhammer dissolve in her hands, but Thiera was 
unharmed. She stood on the edge of a crater, the sprinklings of blue in 
the sand all that remained of the great monolith that had stood on that 
spot for thousands upon thousands of years.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's done, Thiera thought. The Wellspring is open, and the world will never be the same.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She looked at her hands. Wisps of blue mist clung to 
them, and as she looked, they moved again in response to her thoughts, 
hinting at the infinite possibilities that now lay at her command.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She spoke aloud, a smile beginning to show below her 
gleaming blue eyes as she thought of her destined path. "And neither 
will I."</p>
