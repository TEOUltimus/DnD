<p align="left">While Eberron is a world of action and pulp adventure, 
it was also inspired by the dark and uncertain tone of film noir. It is a
 world where little is truly as it seems, where stories don't always end
 well, and where allies can become enemies in the blink of an eye. While
 this sounds exciting, it can be difficult to do well. Here are a few 
points to consider if you want to add more mystery and betrayal to your 
campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Simple Betrayal vs. the Big, Bad Picture</b></p>
<p align="left">Betrayal is one of the classic noir themes, probably 
because it can be used in so many ways: the employer who lies about a 
job; the supposed friend who leads the party into a trap; the merchant 
who passes false goods. All of these can be fine plot devices when used 
in moderation. However, if every patron cheats the party, every guide 
leads them astray, and every piece of treasure turns out to be cursed, 
you won't create a sense of intrigue. If betrayal is so common that it 
becomes expected, then there's no suspense, only a frustrating sense of 
paranoia. If you never trust anyone, you never really feel the dramatic 
impact of betrayal.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Consider the following:</b></p>
<p align="left">The party is approached by a gnome, Janius Jen Solan. 
Her platinum rings suggest that she is a member of the Aurum. She offers
 the party a considerable sum of cash to recover a Dhakaani relic from a
 ruin beneath Fairhaven. The porter the party hires turns out to be 
working for the Order of the Emerald Claw; at a key moment, he springs 
an undead ambush on the adventurers and tries to steal the relic. At the
 end, Janius appears with a small army of Deneith mercenaries -- too 
many for the party to fight. Instead of paying the heroes, she takes the
 artifact, leaving them with their lives but little else.</p>
<p align="left">On a certain level, this satisfies many noir 
stereotypes. But how is it fun for the party? What will they do the next
 time a gnome offers them a job? How many hirelings can prove 
treacherous before the players resolve never to use NPC servants again? </p>
<p align="left"><b>As an alternative, consider this:</b></p>
<p align="left">The party is approached by a gnome, Janius Jen Solan. 
While she introduces herself as a scholar from Morgrave University, her 
copper rings suggest that she might be a member of the Aurum; if asked 
about this, she acknowledges that she is a member of the lowest concord.
 She offers the party a moderate sum to acquire a Dhakaani relic from 
beneath Fairhaven, along with the promise that there will be other 
treasures to recover. At a key moment during the mission, the porter 
hired by the party reveals that he is being blackmailed by the Order of 
the Emerald Claw; those villains demanded that he lead the heroes into a
 trap. If he does not, his family will be killed. With his help, the 
party can plan a counter-ambush and turn the tables on the would-be 
assassins. The party then recovers the relic plus additional treasure, 
and there is much rejoicing. All seems well. </p>
<p align="left">Of course, things are not what they seem. In future 
sessions, the party is attacked repeatedly by well-organized groups of 
angry Dhakaani goblinoids. It turns out that in recovering the relic and
 looting the other treasure in the ruin, they desecrated one of the 
holiest Dhakaani tombs. Now the goblinoids will not rest until every 
item has been recovered. Janius was entirely ignorant of this. She is in
 danger from another direction, as well; she was given this task by a 
higher-ranking member of the Aurum, to whom she gave the relic in an 
attempt to rise within the ranks. She will help the party as best she 
can, but she has little influence, and the dwarf who now holds the relic
 has great influence. Can the party get the relic away from him? What 
sort of enemies will they make in the process?</p>
<p align="left">More surprises wait to be revealed. The "porter" was 
actually a member of House Thuranni. The Order of the Emerald Claw never
 intended to ambush the party; instead, the porter tricked the party 
into attacking a group of Emerald Claw operatives on a top-secret 
mission. Now the Emerald Claw thinks that these characters are 
interfering with one of their major schemes, and it will take steps to 
end the interference. This unwittingly reveals the plot to the party, 
giving them a chance to stop it. But who hired the Thuranni operative? 
Was this an attempt to frame the player characters, or were they just 
convenient tools for an attack against the Claw? </p>
<p align="left">Simple betrayal has obvious, short-term consequences for
 what are typically clear-cut heroes and villains. By contrast, a subtle
 scheme may take weeks or months to come to light, and there may not be 
an obvious bad guy. In the second example, Janius didn't realize what 
she was doing, and even the porter was simply doing a job; his unknown 
employee is the true villain. </p>
<p align="left">The more subtle betrayal is less likely to cause a 
knee-jerk reaction in the future. Yes, the gnome nearly got them killed,
 but she didn't grasp the significance of the site. Besides, the PCs 
were the ones who looted the rest of the tomb. The next time a gnome 
offers them a job they may ask more questions, but hopefully they won't 
say "All gnomes are evil!" and refuse to play. </p>
<p align="left">The key axiom to bear in mind is that <i>no one likes to lose</i>.
 If betrayal takes the party's victory away from them -- as when the 
villain steals their treasure and they get nothing -- the players will 
be frustrated and angry. If the betrayal simply sets a new storyline in 
motion, the fun of the past story is not swept away and the players can 
enjoy their new quest for survival ... and revenge.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Good Today, Bad Tomorrow </b></p>
<p align="left">One of the themes of Eberron is that good and evil are 
not clear cut. An evil vampire can serve the greater good while a noble 
cleric might, with the best of intentions, set a terrible inquisition in
 motion. Learning a character's alignment gives you a clue as to how far
 you can trust her, but it's only one piece of a puzzle. </p>
<p align="left">Where this is true of individuals, it is equally true of
 organizations. The Aurum is untrustworthy, but not every member is 
evil. It can take actions that will have positive results (though 
there's probably profit for the patron in there somewhere). An 
organization is a collection of individuals, each with his or her own 
goals. The trick is to develop contacts the party can trust so, when 
they get a job from a new member of the Aurum, they can check with their
 old ally to see where they stand -- assuming, of course, that their old
 ally hasn't turned against them or been replaced by the Lords of Dust. 
Nothing is ever certain!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Biting the Hand</b></p>
<p align="left">While a party can be betrayed by its patrons or allies, 
it could also be employed by a patron who is plotting against his own 
organization. Then the PCs aren't the ones being betrayed. Instead they 
are the instruments of betrayal. Janius Jen Solan has a scheme to get to
 the Platinum Concord, but it involves killing a number of powerful 
members of the Aurum. If the party assists Janius, the characters stand 
to gain a considerable amount of local influence. If they fail, they 
will place themselves in grave danger. </p>
<p align="left">Then there is the question of Janius's motives. Is her 
desire for power fueled by simple greed, or is she actually a disguised 
member of the Lords of Dust, possessed by a spirit from the Dreaming 
Dark, or a spy for the Royal Eyes of Aundair? </p>
<p align="left">Again, the key is not to steal the party's victory! Even
 if Janius lied about her motives, the party will still benefit from its
 association. The characters will get treasure, and experience, and the 
satisfaction of beating the unpleasant members of the Aurum. They'll 
gain a powerful patron in Janius. What happens when they discover that 
Janius is using them to strike against the King's Citadel? Will they get
 deeper into the intrigue, or will they betray their former patron?</p>
<p align="left">This level of intrigue isn't for everyone. You may 
prefer to stick with straightforward dungeon crawls and never worry 
about the consequences of these tasks. As the Five nations search for 
ancient weapons and the secret of the Mournland, however, even dungeon 
crawls can be tied to political intrigue. Who knows? That magic ring you
 find in the goblin's cave could turn out to be the key to victory in 
the next war.</p>
