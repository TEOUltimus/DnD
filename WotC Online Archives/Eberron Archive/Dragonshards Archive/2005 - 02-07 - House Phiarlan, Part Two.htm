<p align="left"><b>Overview</b></p>
<p align="left">The elves of House Phiarlan carry the Mark of Shadow. 
The house originates from an ancient order of bards, and most people 
know them for their ability to entertain others. But behind the curtain 
they run an intelligence network that stretches across Khorvaire, and 
most of the powers of Khorvaire have used Phiarlan services at some 
point in the past.</p>
<p align="left">Taken as a whole, House Phiarlan is a neutral 
organization. Few of the Phiarlan elves are cold-blooded killers, and 
while Phiarlan spies frequently break the laws of the land in their 
work, members of the house respect the overall structure of society. To a
 large degree the leaders of the house see themselves as agents of 
balance, evening the odds between opponents and exposing feuds that 
would otherwise fester and grow. </p>
<p align="left">The heraldic symbol of the house is a five-headed hydra.
 Many say that this represents the five artistic demesnes of the house. 
But some maintain that the hydra symbolizes the resilience and subtlety 
of the house: Its eyes are everywhere, and should one head fall, two 
will take its place. Phiarlan uses a stylized silver mask -- the "mask 
of shadows" -- as a secondary symbol. This is reminiscent of the golden 
mask of the Undying Court; members of the house may wear an actual 
full-sized mask, or carry a replica of the mask as a brooch, amulet, 
ring, or belt buckle.</p>
<p align="left">The house has many enclaves, but the most significant 
are the Five Demesnes. Many consider the primary enclave to be the 
Demesne of Shadow in Sharn, which Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan 
oversees. However, the known enclaves serve as the centers of Phiarlan's
 <i>artistic</i> endeavors. No one knows where the Serpentine Table (the
 espionage arm of the house) has its base of operations -- this is a 
mystery for the DM to decide.</p>
<p align="left">Each enclave has a governing council and a baron who 
represents the enclave on the central council, which quarterly convenes 
in Sharn to discuss the business of the house. Ostensibly, political 
position within the house is based on talent, and members of enclave 
councils often include the local masters of the five disciplines. But 
ultimately the baron makes the appointments. The central council (or the
 Serpentine Table) can replace a baron who is failing in her duties or 
performing questionably, and this council appoints new barons when an 
opening appears. Small outposts have no council and are governed by the 
nearest enclave. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Barons of the Stage</b></p>
<p align="left">Best known for its Artisans and Entertainers Guild, 
House Phiarlan has hundreds of years to devote to a particular art. As a
 result, the masters of Phiarlan are legends in their fields; Tyasha 
d'Phiarlan (<i>Sharn: City of Towers, </i>page 70) is an example of a 
savant of the house. Phiarlan entertainers covered a vast spectrum of 
arts, and the typical Phiarlan enclave has musicians, actors, poets, 
dancers, and even professional escorts available. While the elves 
themselves are the primary ambassadors of the arts, exceptional members 
of other races can earn a place in one of the Five Demesnes and study at
 the feet of the elven masters. An entertainer with Phiarlan 
certification has an easier time finding work in his field -- however, 
he needs to possess at least 8 ranks in his chosen art before he can 
earn such a degree. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Five Demesnes</b></p>
<p align="left">The elves of House Phiarlan practice hundreds of 
different styles of song, dance, and other arts, from the ancient 
traditions of Xen'drik to the modern styles of Khorvaire. Long ago, the 
founders of the house divided the arts into five disciplines. The 
greatest masters and teachers of these arts have settled in the five 
major enclaves of the house, which are known as demesnes. The Five 
Demesnes of Phiarlan and the arts associated with them are described 
below. Teachers of all disciplines train willing students at each 
enclave, but someone who wants to deal with the best in the field should
 travel to the appropriate demesne.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Memory.</b> The discipline of memory encompasses the 
written word. Novelists, playwrights, and poets are all students of 
memory. Phiarlan also considers propaganda to be a fine art. A play, a 
novel, or a song can have a powerful effect on public opinion, and for 
an extra fee a Phiarlan author can produce work that portrays the client
 in an especially good light -- or vilifies an opponent. Many leaders 
make use of Phiarlan speech writers; more than one politician has hired a
 disguised shadow actor to give an important speech on his behalf.</p>
<p align="left">The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven in Aundair.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Motion.</b> The discipline of motion incorporates the
 arts of the body. This includes dance, gymnastics, wrestling, mime, 
contortion, massage, and many more. Phiarlan dancers master dozens of 
styles and are renowned for their grace. Exceptional acrobats and 
contortionists may find work with the Carnival of Shadows, while lesser 
tumblers often entertain the commonfolk on the streets or cheap 
theaters. The Serpentine Table often recruits gifted students of motion;
 masters of motion frequently can adapt their skills to burglary and 
battle. Phiarlan escorts study the arts of motion and shadow. These 
elves are not prostitutes, but they are graceful companions gifted in 
conversation, dance, and massage. Dragonmarked escorts can also use 
their powers to adopt specific identities to fulfill the wishes of a 
client. Since most people are more comfortable around elves than 
changelings, a wealthy man who wants the company of a particular woman 
may hire a Phiarlan companion to impersonate her instead of a 
changeling.</p>
<p align="left">The Demesne of Motion is located in the city of Korth in Karrnath.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Music.</b> The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of 
sound -- both song and the use of instruments. Phiarlan bards have 
scoured Khorvaire for musical traditions, and some instructors can teach
 the arts of Adaran chant and other obscure styles. Most Phiarlan bards 
spend some time at the Demesne of Music, though many also study at the 
Demesne of Shadow. </p>
<p align="left">The Demesne of Music is located in the city of Flamekeep in Thrane.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shape.</b> The Demesne of Shape covers the creation 
of physical objects. One of the primary duties of the Demesne of Shape 
is the creation of the resources the house requires for its entertainers
 -- costumes, sets, props, instruments, and the like. However, the 
Artisans and Entertainers Guild also covers aesthetic art, and 
sculptors, painters, and potters can all learn their trades at this 
demesne. The sale of such goods is a significant source of income for 
the house, and the woodsmiths of Phiarlan are said to be the finest 
outside of Aerenal itself.</p>
<p align="left">The first Demesne of Shape was located in the city of 
Metrol in Cyre. The destruction of Cyre dealt a blow to the house, but 
at the start of the war Phiarlan had spread the resources of the house 
across the Five Nations to avoid just such a disaster, and miraculously 
(some say suspiciously) all the finest teachers and artisans were 
visiting other demesnes on the Day of Mourning. The new Demesne of Shape
 has been established in Wroat, in Breland. </p>
<p align="left">While the finest artists survived the Mourning, a great 
deal of Phiarlan craftwork and mystical tools were lost in the fall of 
Cyre. The house may wish to hire a team of adventurers to venture into 
the Mournland and recover objects from Metrol -- or perhaps a PC member 
of the house could find herself performing this task as a show of 
loyalty to the house.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shadow.</b> In its broadest sense, the discipline of 
Shadow covers the art of deception. This includes illusion, which the 
house has refined into a fine art; Phiarlan dream parlors and shadow 
weavers use magic to produce astonishing shows. It also includes literal
 shadow plays and puppetry -- arts in which the actual actor performs at
 a distance from the audience. But the Demesne of Shadow also serves as 
the center for verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigned emotion, 
and role assumption. Actors and orators learn their craft at this 
demesne, and while a storyteller may learn his tales at the Demesne of 
Memory, he learns to deliver a tale at the Demesne of Shadow. Stealth 
and sleight of hand are also taught in this place, since the stagehand 
and the puppeteer need to hide in the shadows and avoid the gaze of the 
audience. Of course, while this is the public reason for such training, 
many of those who study the arts of stealth are actually members of the 
Serpentine Table -- or hope to be recruited by this inner circle. </p>
<p align="left">The Demesne of Shadow is located in Sharn, in Breland. 
With the destruction of the first Demesne of Music, it is the oldest of 
the Five Demesnes and is the current home of the house matriarch.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Services and Events</b></p>
<p align="left">In general, a well-staffed Phiarlan enclave can provide 
any sort of entertainment. Most Phiarlan entertainers are experts versed
 in a range of Perform skills. However, many true bards who can weave 
magic into their performances are also in the house. The house runs a 
number of theaters, but Phiarlan bards often work with local 
establishments; Phiarlan actors often take center stage regardless of 
who owns the theater. </p>
<p align="left">In addition to these general performances, a few events 
of note are held by the house. The annual reenactments of the battles 
between the elves and the dragons are extremely popular. But the 
best-known work of the house is the Carnival of Shadows, which is a 
traveling circus that combines illusion, physical arts, and exotic 
beasts from across Eberron. Three separate companies of the Carnival of 
Shadows migrate between the major cities of Khorvaire, and they reach 
even the Lhazaar Principalities and the Talenta Plains. From an 
adventuring perspective, the carnival offers a variety of hooks. To 
begin with, agents of the Serpentine Table often travel with the 
Carnival of Shadows; this could result in adventurers coming into 
conflict with Phiarlan schemes when the circus comes to town, or it 
could mean that PCs working with the house are sent to join the 
carnival. The beasts that travel with the circus can also pose a 
challenge; an escaped monster could wreak havoc on a city, or 
adventurers could find themselves hired to capture an exotic creature in
 Xen'drik and transport it -- alive -- back to Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Heirloom Performances</b></p>
<p align="left">While House Phiarlan has split off from Aerenal and has 
no ties to the Undying Court, the members of the house still hold the 
memories of their ancestors and their history in high regard. The 
greatest treasures of the house are the works of ancient artists -- the 
dance with which Jhazalaen Elorrenthi blinded the King of Fire, the song
 that Maenol sang as the elves boarded the boats to leave Xen'drik, and 
similar epic works. While every member of the house can perform some of 
these, many of the greatest works of the house are considered to be 
heirloom performances. Only one living elf has the right to perform a 
particular heirloom. This is a tremendous honor, and every Phiarlan bard
 strives to prove her worth to inherit such a treasure. Traditionally, 
the bearer of the heirloom chooses her successor, but should she die 
without designating an heir, the council of the appropriate demesne can 
select a new elf to perform the art. Stories have circulated about how 
demesne councils assassinate unworthy heirs so the heirloom could be 
transferred to a superior artist -- but these stories have never been 
proven. </p>
