<p align="LEFT"><i>Kharizhak cried out in fear and rage but the sound 
was drowned out by the roar of the white dragon as she dived down from

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Heart and History</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A traveler passing through Q'barra or the Lhazaar 
Principalities is sure to hear tales of the tribes of the Seren Islands.
 These fierce barbarians guard the coast of Argonnessen, and it is said 
that the waters of Totem Beach run red from the blood of their victims. 
In song and story, the Serens are typically cast as horrible monsters --
 firebreathing warriors who consume the flesh of their still-living foes
 and sacrifice children to their draconic gods.</p>
<p align="LEFT">These stories are much exaggerated. The Serens are 
fierce warriors who will give their lives to defend the shores of 
Argonnessen from outsiders but they are not cannibals, and their 
reverence for dragons is more complex than simple awe of the mighty 
beasts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Approximately thirty Seren tribes are scattered across 
the islands and the coastline of Argonnessen. Every tribe has a legend 
of a draconic covenant: a tale of how their ancestors were brought from a
 distant land by a mighty dragon and charged to honor the dragon and 
defend the land from the weak and unworthy. The dragonspeaker priests 
say that the dragons are the embodiment of all that is best in the human
 spirit. When a Seren dies, his soul is judged, and if he has upheld the
 covenant, he is placed in the shell of a dragon's egg. When enough 
worthy souls are brought together in the egg, it hatches and a new 
dragon is born, distilled from the essence of all the noble souls that 
went before. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Seren islands are harsh and unforgiving, and the 
tribes exist in continuous conflict. The first recorded contact with the
 Serens comes from a Sarlonan account from -3,120. The civilization has 
changed very little over the millennia; the Serens are devoted to their 
traditions. Until the dragons themselves order a change, the Serens will
 continue to uphold the covenants. Any traveler who wishes to explore 
the land of the dragons will have to deal with these barbarians. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>National Character</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Each Seren tribe is defined by its draconic covenant. 
When creating a Seren tribe, a DM needs to answer the following 
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What color was the draconic founder? Look to appearance, breath 
weapon, and elemental ties for things that the Seren tribe will use for 
inspiration. Traditionally tribes of the same color frequently act as 
allies despite different alignments and beliefs. <br><br></li>
<li>What alignment was the founder? In Eberron, alignment and draconic color are not automatically linked.<br><br></li>
<li>The Serens are charged to protect Argonessen from the unworthy and 
to honor the founder. This is a vague directive. What were the specific 
words of the founder? What does this tribe consider unworthy and how do 
they honor the founder? Because the Serens consider upholding the 
covenant to be their key to the afterlife, this is a major point. A 
violent, chaotic tribe could believe that they honor their founder by 
spilling the blood of anyone weaker than themselves. A more peaceful 
tribe could believe that they honor the founder by amassing knowledge or
 treasures. <br><br></li>
<li>In addition to the general vow to protect Argonnessen, some of the 
tribes have specific, additional charges -- protecting a specific shrine
 or guarding a particular piece of treasure, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Seren culture is very warlike, and the Serens repel any 
invaders. Because of this, the people of Khorvaire and Sarlona have 
learned to avoid Argonnessen, leaving the Serens to spend most of their 
time fighting each other. Through these battles the Serens hone their 
skills and prove their worth as guardians. Only the strongest have a 
place on the shores of Argonessen. Children and caregivers are generally
 spared during raids, allowing tribes to eventually recover from defeat.
 </p>
<p align="LEFT">Most of the Seren tribes have a similar social 
structure. The warlord is the mightiest warrior. This position is based 
purely on skill, and any member of the tribe can challenge a warlord. 
The warlord oversees all military action: patrolling the land, 
organizing raids, training young soldiers. A council of dragonspeakers, 
mystics who use wisdom and magic to guide the tribe, oversees spiritual 
and domestic matters. Dragonspeaker is a lifelong post with authority 
within the council based on age. Despite the warlike nature of the 
Serens, dragonspeakers hold final authority and can overrule a warlord's
 decisions or even force a warlord to step down from his position. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Gender roles vary by tribe and are often depend on the 
gender of the founding dragon. In many tribes, female warriors 
(barbarians) are just as common as men, while in other tribes women 
become spiritual leaders or are allowed only domestic roles.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Appearance</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Serens claim that the dragons brought them from many
 lands, and their appearance backs this up. All manner of skin and hair 
color can be found among the Serens, though there is a tendency toward 
dark complexions and heavy builds. Tattooing is a common practice on the
 islands; as Seren warriors win victories in battle, they earn the right
 to have draconic features tattooed across their bodies. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Seren culture is primitive. Warriors typically wear hide
 or leather armor. Some rely on dragonscale tattoos in place of physical
 armor. Weapons are made from wood, bone, or shell. Each tribe, however,
 possesses heirloom arms and armor handed down from the draconic 
founders. These can be both traditional items from the dragons' hoards 
and dragonscale armor or weapons made from dragon bones or claws. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Away from the battlefield, most Serens wear simple, gray
 clothing. As Serens rise in influence and reputation, they are allowed 
to wear clothing and accessories matching the color of the draconic 
founder. Dragon scale and dragon bone ornaments are reserved for the 
greatest heroes of the tribe. Such treasures are not passed to 
descendents upon the owner's death but rather returned to the tribe to 
be awarded to the next hero who proves worthy.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Language and Names</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Serens speak Draconic as opposed to Common. A Seren 
may take Common as a bonus language or learn Common by spending a single
 skill point.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Seren names are also based on the Draconic language. 
They do not use family names, instead earning titles and honorifics tied
 to the draconic founder, such as Delhasha'alhasc ("Delhasha the Cold").
 </p>
<p align="LEFT">Typical Male Names: Durshast, Kharizhak, Lhasharak, Nolashar, Solashan, Xaxhan </p>
<p align="LEFT">Typical Female Names: Aralithyr, Delhasha, Eshka, Freilashka, Hakalasha, Shaesthyr </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Character Classes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Serens are raised to be as fierce in battle as the 
dragons that they revere. The harsh life of the islands lends strength 
to those who survive it. Most adult Serens have at least one barbarian 
class level. A few clans with martial traditions mingle barbarian with 
ranger or monk but these are rare (and respected).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The dragons taught the druidic secrets to humanity, and 
most dragonspeakers are druids following the traditions of the 
Gatekeepers or Wardens of the Woods. A few tribes have a bardic 
tradition, and sorcerers can also be found among the Serens. Sorcerers 
typically develop powers related to the tribal founder (fire spells for a
 red sorcerer, for example). While sorcerers are usually considered 
blessed, a sorcerer who develops spells that seem out of line with the 
tribal founder -- e.g., fire spells for the tribe of a white dragon -- 
might be driven from the tribe. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Dracolytes, Dragonsong Lyricists, and Dragon Disciples 
can also be found among the Serens, and the members of their tribes 
idolize them. Such individuals, however, are often called to serve 
dragons themselves and disappear into the center of Argonnessen. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Seren Adventurers</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">It is unusual for a Seren to leave the islands and 
shores of Argonessen. When creating a traveling Seren PC or NPC, you 
should decide why he left his homeland. Consider the following ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>A dragonspeaker -- possibly a member of the Chamber in disguise -- 
claims that the character must wander the world to fulfill a prophecy 
and find her destiny. <br><br></li>
<li>The gatekeepers have charged the character to travel to the Land of 
Demons (Khorvaire) to fight the plans of the Lords of Dust and the Cults
 of the Dragon Below. <br><br></li>
<li>The character was banished for stealing relics from a sacred shrine.
 She is innocent but the only way to prove this is to locate the 
artifacts, wherever they might be!<br><br></li>
<li>A treacherous feud within the tribe resulted in the death of all 
other members of the character's family. He swore to find powerful 
allies and return to destroy his enemies and claim leadership of the 
tribe.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Sample Seren Tribes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Approximately thirty barbarian tribes are spread among 
the Seren Islands and the coast of Argonnessen. A few representative 
tribes are described below. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>Bringers of Fire</b> were founded by a chaotic 
evil red dragon. One of the largest and most dangerous tribes, they are 
one of the only tribes known to completely exterminate Seren clans that 
they view as unworthy. The Bringers of Fire paint their skin red before 
battle and make use of flaming oil. They are renowned for their volatile
 temperaments. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>White Wanderers</b> were founded by a true 
neutral white dragon. They are a nomadic tribe charged to protect a 
series of shrines. They believe in the power of knowledge and magic, and
 have a high percentage of literacy and dragonspeakers. Explorers and 
outsiders looking for Serens to deal with would do well to focus on this
 tribe. White Wanderers have a cold, chilly demeanor, and never let 
their emotions show. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>Stormwalkers</b> were founded by a lawful evil 
blue dragon. Although one of the smallest tribes, they are nonetheless 
dangerous and thus, highly respected. The Stormwalkers developed a 
martial, monastic tradition emulating the natural attacks of the dragon,
 and the greatest masters of this art can follow the Initiate of the 
Draconic Mysteries prestige class presented in the <i>Draconomicon. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>Frostblades </b>were founded by a lawful good 
white dragon. While they ruthlessly defend the land from outsiders, they
 also seek to preserve weaker tribes from the depredations of more 
violent clans such as the Bringers of Fire. Frostblade dragonspeakers 
know the secret of alchemist's frost and sometimes use this as a weapon 
in battle. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>Totem Guardians </b>are not a tribe. Rather, they
 are an alliance of elite soldiers drawn from many tribes. These are the
 defenders of Totem Beach and the Great Barrier of Argonnessen. Their 
recruits are drawn from the dreams of dragonspeaker priests who receive 
dream-visions ordering particular warriors to Totem Beach to join the 
guardians. In a few special cases, dragons have personally visited a 
tribe to call a Seren to the guardians. A Totem Guardian possesses at 
least six character levels and may possess levels in the Dracolyte, 
Dragonkith, or Dragonrider prestige classes presented in the <i>Draconomicon.</i></p>
