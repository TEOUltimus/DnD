 is a world of magic. Many forms of life have been shaped by magical 
forces. This can be seen in the minor illusion-weaving ability of the 
gnomes, the teleporting blink dog, or the petrifying gaze of the medusa.
 The deadly power of a medusa can certainly inspire terror, and thinking
 of this creature as a simple monster is easy. But medusas are not 
savage predators, roaming the wastes in search of prey. The medusas of 
Cazhaak Draal are, on average, more intelligent than most humans, and 
they have a proud city-state in the midst of Droaam. The power of the 
medusas is a potent weapon in the arsenal of Droaam. But what role do 
medusas play in the monster nation? How are they seen in the outside 
world? And what can you expect when dealing with them?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Kingdom of Stone</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The medusas were born in Khyber, and no one on the 
surface knows the extent of their subterranean civilization. In 778 YK, a
 force of medusas emerged from the underworld and laid claim to the city
 of Cazhaak Draal, an ancient goblin metropolis that had been abandoned 
since the daelkyr incursion. Over the course of the last two hundred 
years, the medusas renovated Cazhaak Draal, repairing the ruins and 
domesticating many of the dangerous creatures found in the region. For 
the most part the medusas were content in their tiny kingdom: Cazhaak 
Draal was far larger than their numbers required, and many treasures and
 wonders existed in the ancient city. Explorers who ventured into the 
Stonelands rarely returned, but the medusas had little interest in the 
outside world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This changed in 985 YK, when a mysterious visitor came 
to speak to the Queen of Stone: a gray-robed hag, who met the medusa's 
gaze without fear. Sora Teraza spoke with Queen Sheshka from sunrise to 
sunset, and after the hag departed, Sheshka spent the evening in silent 
contemplation. The next day she told her people to prepare for great 
change. Over the course of the next year she brought together a corps of
 medusas, preparing them for service in foreign lands. When the 
Daughters of Sora Kell assumed power in 986 YK, representatives of 
Cazhaak Draal were quickly dispatched to the Great Crag. Today medusa 
architects direct the ongoing construction of Droaam's capital. Medusas 
hold many positions of power, both in Droaam and in the monstrous 
communities that have since spread across Khorvaire; in Sharn, the 
medusa Kasslak maintains order in the dangerous district of Malleon's 
Gate, while a medusa named Harash is the second-in-command of Sharn's 
Daask cell. The deadly power of a medusa commands respect, but in a 
nation of ogres, minotaurs, and harpies, the keen intellect of the 
medusa is often more useful than its petrifying gaze.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The people of Cazhaak Draal have prospered since the 
rise of the hags, and for the moment, the Queen of Stone is content to 
serve. The Daughters of Sora Kell are formidable enemies, and Sheshka 
does not have the power to challenge them. But the medusa queen is 
ambitious and cunning, and she is always searching for ways to increase 
her influence.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Children of Stone and Shadow</b></p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="260"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>For a look at variant medusas, consult the recent <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/eo/20060324a">Elite Opponents</a></i> article on these snaked-haired charmers.</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The Gatekeepers claim that medusas were created by the 
daelkyr Orlassk, but the medusa priests of Cazhaak Draal offer their 
devotions to the Shadow. They claim that the Shadow shaped many of the 
creatures humans see as monsters, giving the harpy her deadly voice, 
hiding the displacer beast from its foes, and healing the wounds of the 
troll. These priests view the deities of the Sovereign Host as the true 
evil, comparing the exile of the Shadow to the fear with which many 
humans respond to medusas and other monsters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, some medusas do earn their evil reputation. 
Several revel in their powers and petrify lesser creatures for sport. 
But a medusa who calls this sort of attention to herself won't last long
 in one of the great cities of Khorvaire. Those medusas chosen to 
represent Droaam in the wider world are carefully vetted by Sheshka and 
officials of House Tharashk. The average medusa is more intelligent and 
cunning than the average human, and she understands the need to control 
her behavior among the soft people of Khorvaire. In Sharn, a medusa may 
move unfettered in the lawless districts, but if she enters a 
respectable neighborhood, she must wear eyeblinders, a metal visor 
secured with straps around forehead and chin; otherwise she may be 
attacked by the Blackened Book, Redcloak Battalion, or other agents of 
the law. Eyeblinders require a full minute to don or remove; in some 
cities, a medusa must have the blinders secured with a lock for the 
duration of her stay.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Despite their worship of the Shadow, medusas are no more
 inherently evil than humans or elves. Some are arrogant and proud, 
believing that their deadly gaze places them above mundane creatures. 
Others respond to the fear they encounter every day by despising those 
who fear them, a path that often leads to evil alignments. But many 
enjoy the same pleasures that humans do, and seek out song, good 
company, and the satisfaction of hard work. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal
 have a strong tradition of stonework, both architecture and purely 
aesthetic sculpture. In recent years, Councilor Kilk of Sharn has sought
 permission to bring in medusa architects and masons to perform work in 
Northedge, although to date the other councilors have refused to use 
city funds to pay for the services of monsters.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Medusa Customs</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The gaze of a medusa can petrify even an ally, and as a 
result, a medusa does not meet the gaze of a person with whom it is 
conversing. Where she directs her eyes indicates her esteem for the 
person. She drops her eyes toward the ground to show respect, or looks 
up and over the person if she wishes to indicate disdain; when speaking 
to an equal, she glances to the left or right. If she wishes to show 
trust, she directs her gaze to the person, but closes her eyes.</p>

</tbody></table>While this may seem inconvenient to a human, it has 
little impact on a medusa. If a medusa concentrates, she can receive 
limited visual impressions from the serpents that make up her hair; as a
 result, though she seems to look elsewhere, she's actually looking 
through the eyes of her serpents. She can even use her serpents to see 
when she is blindfolded or has her eyes closed. However, she can still 
"see" in only one direction in this way; her serpents may look all 
around her, but she can't process the information from all of them at 
once. If a medusa is relying solely on the visual input from her 
serpents, she suffers a -2 penalty on Spot and Search checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> A medusa uses its living mane for many purposes. In 
addition to serving as weapons and a supplemental form of eyesight, a 
medusa's serpents also help her communicate. The motions of the serpents
 often reflect a medusa's mood, and a DM should consider the state of a 
medusa's mane when describing her actions. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal 
have developed a simple language called Serpentine, which is based on 
the motions and hissing of their snakes. Serpentine has no written 
aspect and can be spoken only by a medusa, but any creature can use 
Speak Language to learn to understand it. A medusa must learn Serpentine
 normally, but it is available to her as a bonus language.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The gaze of a medusa is a powerful weapon, but most 
medusas don't think of it as deadly. A petrified victim can be restored 
to life, after all; within their own society, medusas often use 
petrification as a way to preserve mortally wounded kin, so they can be 
restored at a later time when healing magic is available. Likewise, 
medusas dying of old age often choose to be petrified before they fully 
pass on; Cazhaak Draal contains a great catacomb filled with the stone 
remnants of respected medusa elders. This ties to the love of stonework 
common in the culture; when a medusa looks at a statue, she sees the 
life it represents.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While some medusas take an interest in archery, in 
general the medusas of Cazhaak Draal have little interest in physical 
combat; they prefer to win their battles with magic or cunning. 
Sorcerers, rogues, and experts are all common among the citizens of 
Cazhaak Draal; the city of stone is also home to smaller numbers of 
clerics, adepts, rangers, and fighters, with the latter specializing in 
ranged combat.</p>
