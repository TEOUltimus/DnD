<p align="left">On the island of Aerenal, the boundaries between life 
and death have worn thin. The Aereni elves preserve their greatest 
heroes through magic and faith, and these deathless have provided 
protection and guidance for thousands of years.</p>
<p align="left">Elven civilization began on the continent of Xen'drik. 
For thousands of years, the elves were enslaved and oppressed by the 
powerful nations of the giants. Thirty-nine thousand years ago the elves
 rose up against the giants . . . but this was a war both sides would 
ultimately lose. At the height of the conflict, a visionary named Aeren 
foresaw a coming cataclysm; she gathered a host of elves and convinced 
them to flee the approaching storm. As dragonfire and terrible magic 
shattered Xen'drik, the elven fleet landed on the island that would 
become their home. Aeren guided the elves to this land, but she never 
saw it with her own eyes; a wasting disease took her life during the 
long voyage. After interring their prophet in the soil of their new 
home, the leaders named their land Aerenal, "Aeren's Rest."</p>
<p align="left">Though they had joined together beneath Aeren's banner, 
the refugees came from many different tribes with a range of traditions 
and beliefs. They shared a common reverence for their ancestors and the 
heroes who had died in the cause of freedom. While the elves were a 
martial culture, Aeren had said that arcane knowledge was the greatest 
weapon of all, and the majority of the elves chose to set aside the 
sword for the book. Calling themselves the Aereni, these elves dedicated
 themselves to the study of magic and mysticism. One of their greatest 
interests was the art of necromancy; in their reverence for their 
ancestors, the elves were determined to find a way to preserve their 
heroes. In time, two schools of thought came to dominate the field of 
necromancy: the techniques of the line of Vol, which many blame for the 
spread of vampirism into Khorvaire; and the traditions of the Priests of
 Transition, which focused on positive energy and the power of Irian. 
Ultimately it was the positive path that took root in the land, and the 
lines united behind the cult of the deathless. The Undying Court has 
ruled the land for over twenty thousand years, and today the deathless 
are inextricably linked to Aereni society. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Aerenal Today</b></p>
<p align="left">In the cities of Aerenal, life and death stand side by 
side. The streets are lined with cenotaphs and memorials far older than 
human civilization, monuments to the ancient history of the elves and 
the heroes of previous eras. While this fascination with the fallen may 
seem morbid to outsiders, it pales by comparison to the presence of the 
undying. While the members of the Undying Court remain in the city of 
Shae Mordai, younger deathless can be found across Aerenal. Few 
foreigners can tell the difference between the deathless and the undead,
 and as a result travelers often describe Aerenal as a land where the 
living consort with zombies and liches.</p>
<p align="left">Beyond its fascination with the death and the deathless,
 Aerenal is a land that looks to the past to shape the present. The 
Aereni elves place tradition above all else: Artists and bards are 
expected to perfect ancient techniques instead of developing new styles.
 The elves apply themselves to their work with uncanny devotion; an 
elven bowyer may spend centuries honing his skills, and produce bows the
 like of which a human craftsman could only dream. But he still follows 
the traditions of the past, and the bow he makes today is a mirror of 
one that could be found in a 5,000-year-old tomb. Magic is the only 
field where innovation is encouraged, since the Aereni believe that 
there is no such thing as perfection when it comes to the arcane arts. 
But even here, the elves often find themselves blinded by their 
traditions; as a result, the magical talents of the younger races are 
becoming a match for the Aereni.</p>
<p align="left">While people from all nations come to do business at the
 port of Pylas Talaer, foreigners are rarely welcome elsewhere in 
Aerenal. Unlike Riedra, no restrictions exist on travel across Aerenal, 
and adventurers can move freely through the land. But the elves have 
little patience for members of the younger races. Elf wizards and sages 
dedicate themselves to their studies, while Aereni artisans devote 
themselves to their crafts. Even farmers and other laborers pursue their
 duties with astonishing devotion, seeking perfection in all that they 
do. Outsiders are a distraction. They are often loud, rude, or simply 
ignorant, and they disrupt the order of Aerenal. So adventurers are 
allowed to travel unhindered through the land -- but they are rarely 
made welcome or catered to in any way. Furthermore, the laws of the land
 are swift and harsh. Crime is a rare occurrence among the Aereni, and 
they have no patience for those who disturb this peace. An Aereni 
magistrate may use <i>zone of truth</i> or other forms of divination to 
confirm the facts of a crime. But the word of the magistrate is final, 
and a criminal has no rights. While exile is more common than execution,
 the wise rogue will ply his trade in a more lenient land. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Elven Lines</b></p>
<p align="left">The nation of Aerenal is an alliance of lines, which 
serve the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court: Melideth, Jhaelian, 
Mendyrian, Vaerol, and Tolaen, to name but a few. Each line is descended
 from one of the tribes that followed the prophet Aeren from Xen'drik. 
As a result, a line is not a single family: It is a city-state 
containing a dozen or more separate families, bound together by common 
history. Thus you can be part of the line of Jhaelian while having the 
family name Dolorenthi. </p>
<p align="left">Each line is led by a noble house, and by tradition only
 the members of these houses can be raised as deathless. But membership 
in a noble house is <i>not</i> hereditary. Aereni nobles are chosen, not
 born: The current members of the house select their successors from 
among the most remarkable members of their line. Aereni nobles do not 
even breed among their house; instead, they breed with other members of 
the line, keeping the noble blood spread throughout the community. For 
the Aereni, reproduction and marriage are two entirely separate things: 
marriage is about love, while children are a concern of the entire 
community. The Aereni believe that their island is a sacred land, and 
that it can support only so many souls; given their practice of 
preserving the dead, population control is a serious issue. An elf must 
earn the right to sire or bear a child, and the nobility has the right 
to determine the match that has the most promise. As a result, the elves
 of a particular line see all members of the line as part of an extended
 family.</p>
<p align="left">Every member of an elven community has the potential to 
rise to the nobility and from there to the Undying Court. Normally, 
nobles are chosen based on the skills that they display, and this is why
 the elves spend centuries honing their talents. But in recent years, 
younger elves have sought to prove their worth through exploits in 
foreign lands, battling the Order of the Emerald Claw or seeking the 
magical secrets of Xen'drik. As an adventurer, this is likely to be the 
path you have chosen: Your heroic deeds may be your ticket to 
immortality! </p>
<p align="left">To date, no half-elf has ever been raised to a noble 
house. But a few Khoravars have rejoined the lines of their ancestors. 
Aereni pride and prejudice make the prospect of a half-elf noble an 
unlikely one. But anything can happen. Perhaps you will be the hero who 
proves that the wisdom of your elven ancestors is untouched by your 
human blood!</p>
