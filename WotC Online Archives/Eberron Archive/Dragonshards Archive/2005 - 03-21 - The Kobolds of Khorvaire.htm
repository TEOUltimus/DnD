<p align="left"><i>The black-scaled sorcerer barked a harsh Draconic 
syllable and a wave of invisible force slammed Daine against the wall, 
pinning him against the rough stone. His captor sneered, needle teeth 
flashing. </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Thinking to walk the deep tunnels alone and unseen,"
 the kobold sneered. "Khyber whispers and warns, and so you are found. 
Dead now, by his hand." </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Daine gasped in pain as the mystical bonds grew tighter, squeezing the breath from his lungs . . . .</i></p>
<p align="left">The kobolds of Khorvaire trace their history to the dawn
 of Eberron. According to ancient legend, kobolds were formed from the 
drops of blood shed in the battle between Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber. A
 new generation of dragons descended from Siberys, Khyber brought forth 
fiends and horrors, and Eberron gave birth to the creatures of nature --
 but the kobolds were already there, spawned from the first battle. True
 or not, this myth is the driving force behind kobold psychology and 
culture.</p>
<p align="left">Two subraces of kobold exist in Khorvaire: the iredar 
(Draconic for "ones of earth"), who trace their ancestry to Eberron, and
 the irvhir (Draconic for "ones below") that descend from Khyber. These 
two races share a common appearance, but each race has a distinctive 
body odor that kobolds can instantly detect; in fact, a kobold can 
automatically identify the subrace of any other kobold within 15 feet. A
 character with long experience with kobolds can distinguish these 
scents by making a successful DC 20 Wisdom check; if the creature 
possesses the scent ability, the DC of this check is reduced to 10. 
Kobolds find the scent of others of their kind to be soothing, and 
kobolds that spend long periods of time away from their own kind often 
become depressed. </p>
<p align="left">Beyond scent, the key distinction between the kobold 
subraces is supernatural. Kobolds produce a surprising number of 
sorcerers, which is a phenomenon they attribute to their supposed bond 
to the progenitor dragons. Irvhir sorcerers typically possess spells 
tied to corruption and darkness, while iredar sorcerers usually have 
powers of defense and binding. This is not an absolute rule, and a 
kobold PC can take any spell that she desires. However, an iredar kobold
 that makes use of spells such as <i>fear</i>, <i>darkness</i>, or <i>chilling touch</i> may be viewed with suspicion by her companions, who see these as the powers of the Dragon Below.</p>
<p align="left">Stories are told of a third subrace of kobolds: the 
irsvern (Draconic for "ones above"), children of Siberys. According to 
legend, these kobolds have wings and live in hidden communities on the 
peaks of the tallest mountains. In 867 YK, Tolas Koln of the Wayfinder 
Foundation set out to recover a copy of the <i>Talarash Siberys </i>said to reside in an abandoned draconic temple in the Ironroot Mountains, and<i></i>the last entry in the expedition journal describes an encounter with winged kobolds with astonishing sorcerous powers<i>. </i>Some
 say that this is a documented encounter with the irsvern kobolds, while
 others dismiss it as a hoax perpetrated by Koln himself. </p>
<p align="left">Outsiders often assume that kobolds are primitive and 
savage since they live in unmodified caverns and rely on oral tradition 
instead of written records. Also, they live in small tribal communities 
and have never come together to create cities, nations, or empires. 
However, kobolds are just as sophisticated as humans or gnomes. While 
they prefer to live in natural environments instead of creating 
artificial structures, kobolds have a great gift for mining and 
stoneworking, and they often fill their lairs with cunning traps. But 
their culture is driven by tradition, and the kobolds have never sought 
to change or progress. They are the children of the dragons, vessels of 
the progenitors' will; change will come when the great dragons mandate 
it. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Lands: </b>To date, kobold communities have been 
encountered in Q'barra and in the Seawall Mountains between Darguun and 
Zilargo. However, kobolds are extremely reclusive, and recent events 
suggest that kobold communities are hidden across Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Settlements:</b> The kobolds of Eberron prefer to 
live in natural caverns. The irvhir kobolds make their homes deep 
beneath the surface, while the iredar kobolds usually live in mountain 
caves. The kobolds believe that these caverns are the veins of the 
progenitor dragons, and they often carve elaborate draconic designs on 
the walls. Kobolds prefer to live in tribes containing approximately 100
 adults. The largest communities can have up to 600 adults. Generally, 
though, a community splits once its population rises too far above 100 
adults, with younger kobolds moving away to found a new community.</p>
<p align="left">Kobolds bond with horrid animals. Horrid creatures -- 
especially burrowing animals such as rats, weasels, and badgers -- are 
frequently found in kobold communities.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Power Groups: </b>Kobold culture revolves around 
three forces. The stonescales (or ternmolik, in Draconic) perform the 
day-to-day tasks required for the survival of a community: crafts, 
agriculture, and the gathering of food when agriculture will not 
suffice. The claws (gix) are soldiers and hunters. And the blood seers 
(iejirastrix) are mystics who hear the voices of the progenitor dragons 
-- sorcerers, druids, and favored souls whose magical powers are seen as
 proof of the kobolds' divine ancestry. </p>
<p align="left">Typically the chieftain of a village is an old claw, 
though in a peaceful region a stonescale can hold the post. The 
chieftain manages the daily affairs of the community while the blood 
seers link the communities together. Seers often travel from village to 
village to meet with other blood seers, discussing their visions and 
issues affecting the race as a whole. </p>
<p align="left">One other force that has an impact on kobold culture: 
the Chamber. While most dragons dismiss the kobold's claims of draconic 
ancestry, kobold blood seers can have strange (though often distorted) 
insights into the Draconic Prophecy, and the Chamber occasionally makes 
use of kobold agents. This can result in teams of kobolds equipped with 
powerful magic weapons and items -- an unpleasant surprise for a group 
of adventurers that underestimates the little reptiles.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Beliefs: </b>Mainstream kobold culture is oriented 
around the worship of a particular progenitor dragon. The irvhir 
tradition is one of the oldest cults of the Dragon Below, though it has 
no connection with the aberration-oriented cults of the Shadow Marches. 
The iredar kobolds revere Eberron as the source of life and nature; this
 is a unique druidic tradition with no ties to the sects of the Eldeen 
Reaches. </p>
<p align="left">The kobolds see themselves as the hands of the 
progenitors in the modern age. And in the past, visions of the blood 
seers have often been tied to the Draconic Prophecy. It is a mystery, 
since the kobolds themselves rarely understand the significance of their
 actions -- but even the Chamber respects this uncanny gift.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, not all kobolds are bound to these beliefs. A
 few tribes have split off from these traditions, ignoring the words of 
the blood seers. Irvhir kobolds often turn to the worship of the Shadow 
or the Mockery, while independent iredar revere Boldrei and Olladra.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Language: </b>Kobolds speak Draconic. There is no 
evidence of the kobolds ever having possessed another language or having
 been taught by dragons. Most kobolds love to talk, and a meal with a 
group of kobolds is a deluge of yapping voices.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Relations: </b>Most kobolds prefer to avoid contact 
with the outside world. Irvhir kobolds are especially xenophobic, and 
the miners of Zilargo have been fighting irvhir kobolds for centuries. 
Iredar kobolds are more moderate in their views. They have little 
interest in foreign cultures and fight irvhir kobolds as often as they 
battle gnomes or humans.</p>
<p align="left">In the wake of the Last War, kobolds have had more 
active presence on the surface of Khorvaire. Kobold scavengers often 
rummage through battlefields and ruined villages. Previously unknown 
irvhir communities have risen from the depths to strike at weakened 
thorps and hamlets along the borders of the Mournland. Whether these are
 random attacks of opportunity or driven by the seers of Khyber remains 
to be seen. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Classes: </b>Kobold soldiers are typically warriors. 
Kobold combat techniques focus on speed as opposed to strength, and 
exceptional hunters are often swashbucklers, scouts, or rangers. Clerics
 and adepts are rare since kobolds favor druids and favored souls. The 
kobolds have no tradition of wizardry, but they produce a remarkable 
number of powerful sorcerers. While all blood seers are spellcasters, 
not all sorcerers become seers. But all kobold sorcerers are considered 
blessed by the progenitor and usually become the champions of their 
tribes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Roleplaying a Khorvaire Kobold </b></p>
<p align="left">When playing a kobold -- either as a PC or NPC -- 
consider a few things first. If you are alone, why have you left your 
tribe? Have you abandoned the beliefs of your people, or are you on a 
quest? Perhaps the blood seers believe you have an important destiny to 
fulfill -- but it requires you to live among the warm.</p>
<p align="left">Kobolds recognize that they are physically weaker than 
most other races, and they rely on cunning to win battles. Treacherous 
tactics are not shameful: They are a sign of intelligence. This applies 
to social situations as well as combat. When dealing with non-kobolds, a
 kobold lies and cheats without a second thought. Your wits are your 
weapons: Use them!</p>
<p align="left">As a kobold, balance arrogance with caution. Your people
 have a divine heritage that places you on an equal footing with 
dragons. On the other hand, divine heritage doesn't do much when you're 
arguing with an angry bugbear. So flaunt your superiority when you can, 
but know your limits!</p>
