<p align="left">Sharn, the City of Towers, the jewel of old Galifar -- 
Our glorious metropolis is known by many names, and its legend stretches
 across the globe. Every day thousands of people pass through Sharn. 
Merchants from distant lands offer Sarlonan silks, Zil elixirs, dragon 
turtle meat from the Sea of Rage, and other fantastic goods. Brelish 
farmers stream down the Old Road bearing the harvest; Sharn has many 
mouths to feed, and the edge of the Dagger is barren and hard. 
Ambassadors rub shoulders with aristocrats, and dragonmark heirs trade 
tales with sages and bold explorers. There is a place for everyone in 
the city of Sharn, and adventure lies around every corner. </p>
<p align="left">Our great city can overwhelm on a first visit, so the 
Sharn Inquisitive produced this simple guide. With it, a good map, and a
 copy of the Sharn Inquisitive to keep you up to date with current 
events, you'll be working the lifts as if you were born in the spires! 
Read on, and welcome to Sharn!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Getting Oriented</b></p>
<p align="left">Sharn sprawls between the Dagger and the Hilt. Its 
fabled towers rise more than a mile into the air. To find your way 
around the city, you must think both horizontally and vertically. If you
 were to look down upon the city from above, you would be able to 
identify five distinct sections or <i>quarters</i>: the Central Plateau, Dura, Menthis Plateau, Northedge, and Tavick's Landing. </p>
<p align="left">Vertically, these clusters of towers are broken into three distinct levels or <i>wards</i>. Thus a citizen of Sharn may refer to Upper Central, Middle Dura, or Lower Northedge.</p>
<p align="left">Each ward is further divided into three to nine <i>districts</i>.
 Each district has its own flavor. The Bazaar of Middle Dura is a center
 for trade; Black Arch in Lower Tavick's Landing is a garrison district 
supporting our brave troops and officers of the watch; and Crystal 
Bridge in Upper Northedge is a purely residential district, home to some
 of the wealthiest families in Sharn. </p>
<p align="left">In addition to the five quarters, there are other regions of note. If you arrived by boat you will have already seen <i>Cliffside</i>,
 which rises up from the shores of the Dagger to the ward of Lower Dura.
 If you're reading this in Cliffside, we advise you to leave quickly, 
because that grimy district can be quite dangerous if you don't know the
 ways of the city! Looking up, you may catch a glimpse of glittering 
clouds floating above the tallest spires: this is <i>Skyway</i>, home to the most privileged citizens of Sharn. Deep beneath the city lie <i>the Cogs</i>, our center of industry; like Cliffside, this is a place casual visitors are advised to avoid. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Transportation</b></p>
<p align="left">Now that you understand the basic layout of Sharn, let's
 discuss the many ways to get where you want to go. You can always rely 
on your feet but walking from Wroann's Gate to Hope's Peak would take 
hours, and the climb far up into the sky is exhausting. If you wish to 
relax and you aren't in a hurry, House Orien maintains a network of 
mule-wagons that travel established routes throughout the city; a 
mule-cart takes time to reach your destination but the carts are 
comfortable and affordable.</p>
<p align="left">If you have coin to spare, the swiftest method of travel
 is one of the wonders of Sharn: the skycoach. Magical energy flows 
through the very air surrounding our city, allowing these vessels to 
soar through the sky with the ease of a Lyrandar airship. The City 
Council has fixed the price of transport at one silver per mile; don't 
let a cunning coachman charge more than he should! </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Things to See</b></p>
<p align="left">Whether you're here for business or pleasure, Sharn has much to offer. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Shopping</b> -- Our open markets are famous 
throughout the region and will serve you well whether you're buying or 
selling. If money is in short supply, you would be advised to go to the 
Bazaar of Middle Dura. You may hear rumors that the Bazaar is a hotbed 
of criminal activity; these are blown out of proportion (but it's always
 wise to watch your purse). Tavick's Market and North Market provide 
security and a greater range of goods, while Tradefair in Middle Central
 offers an impressive selection of the finest goods from across the 
land. Beyond the open markets are hundreds of specialized shops and 
services spread throughout the city; sadly, we cannot present them all 
in this limited space. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Worship -- </b>The district of Sovereign Towers is 
home to two of the largest temples in Breland: the Pavilion of the Host 
and the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame. On festivals and holy days, 
Sovereign Towers is a center of celebration and devotion. Among the many
 shrines spread throughout the city are a few sacred sites that bring 
pilgrims from across Khorvaire: the Great Hall of Aureon, the Korranath,
 and deep below the city, the Pool of Onatar's Tears. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Entertainment --</b> From the theaters of Tavick's 
Landing to the aerial sports of Dura, Sharn hosts many splendid events 
to sample. You can watch the windchasers from the spires of Hareth's 
Folly, enjoy a night of bawdy comedy in Torchfire or a traditional 
concert in Kavarrah, or venture to Cornerstone to watch a deadly hrazhak
 match. From drama and athletics to intimate companionship, Sharn has 
entertainments to please even the most jaded palates. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><b>Dining --</b> Speaking of palates, culinary marvels 
can be found on every corner. A few are truly worthy of mention. For 
those with plenty of coin, nothing can compare to a meal at the 
Celestial Vista, gazing down at the towers from the clouds of Skyway. 
The Oaks in Shae Lias serves both Brelish and Aereni cuisine, and the 
master chef has spent centuries perfecting her skills. If money is 
limited, Olladra's Arms in High Hope specializes in banquet-style 
dining, serving generous portions to anyone who can find a seat around 
one of the long tables. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This is but a taste of what Sharn has to offer. Floating
 orchards, dream parlors, and greater wonders await you. You might 
mingle with heirs and ambassadors in Central Plateau, enroll at Morgrave
 University, or find loyal comrades in one of the many guilds of the 
city. Should you possess the skills and backing, you might try your luck
 in the Race of Eight Winds. The opportunities in Sharn could fill a 
book: go forth and explore! </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What to Avoid</b></p>
<p align="left">Every city has its darker side, and Sharn is no 
exception. Clifftop, Lower Dura, the Cogs -- all of these places can be 
dangerous for a wandering tourist, especially one laden with gold. If 
possible, avoid these areas completely; under no circumstances should 
you allow anyone to take you to the goblinoid settlements of Dura or the
 subterranean district known as Khyber's Gate. While these places have 
never been safe, there has been a considerable increase in violence over
 the last few years; our investigations suggest that a group of 
immigrants from Droaam have upset the balance of power in the criminal 
underworld, and this violence often spills into the lower wards. </p>
<p align="left">These beasts are not the only source of violence. In the
 wake of the Last War, our Lord Mayor graciously allowed many refugees 
to take residence in the lower wards, and old wounds sometimes rise to 
the surface, causing riot and bloodshed. </p>
<p align="left">Many tourists are intrigued by the idea of seeing the 
wreckage of the Glass Tower but we must advise against it. The district 
of Godsgate was in decline before the disaster, and after the Glass 
Tower fell in 918 YK, Godsgate was left in ruins. Today it is known as 
Fallen, and it is a place best left alone. </p>
<p align="left">Some adventuresome souls are intrigued by tales of 
ancient goblin ruins deep beneath the city, rumored to reach all the way
 into Khyber. Do not seek out the past! These ruins were sealed off long
 ago to prevent the unwise from releasing buried horrors or triggering 
ancient traps. While they still draw foolhardy adventurers and treasure 
hunters, we hope that you will be wise enough to avoid this glittering 
lure. </p>
<p align="left">Finally, we urge you to turn away anyone who encourages 
the use of dreamlily, absentia, dragon's blood, or other mysterious 
substances. Aside from the obvious dangers of dealing with criminals, 
these elixirs and others of their ilk can have dangerous effects on 
those who partake. The wise traveler will keep his hands clean and his 
head clear. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>A Final Word</b></p>
<p align="left">We have spoken of the many wonders and dangers of Sharn.
 In both instances, we have barely scratched the surface of what awaits 
you. Sharn is filled with beauty but, just as a rose has its thorns, the
 city holds hidden threats for the unwary. Enjoy yourself but exercise 
caution. Don't trust too easily, and be careful whom you anger; even the
 most innocent-seeming person may have powerful allies. A casual insult 
could result in a swift trip to the bottom of the Dagger. </p>
<p align="left">Now, call for a skycoach and make your way into the 
clouds. Treat yourself to a meal at the Celestial Vista, then catch the 
latest show at the Grand Stage. Sharn awaits!</p>
