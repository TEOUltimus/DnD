<p align="left">In this age of tenuous peace, the warforged are a 
constant reminder of the Last War. These living constructs are described
 in detail in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/177450000">Races of Eberron</a></i>. The next two Dragonshards expand on the material in <i>Races of Eberron</i>, looking at specific aspects of warforged history, physiology, and psychology.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aaren d'Cannith: Father of the Warforged </b></p>
<p align="left">The name that most people associate with the warforged 
is that of Merrix d'Cannith. This man developed the first of the 
creation forges, and his warforged titans were the first of the sentient
 constructs. As brilliant as Merrix II was, it was his son Aaren who 
created the first truly living constructs. Born into an age of war, 
Aaren was a philosopher as well as an artificer. While his father worked
 on weapons, Aaren studied the nature of life itself, seeking ways to 
breathe true consciousness into metal and stone. Many ridiculed his 
ideas until his work bore strange fruit. Using a modified creation 
forge, Aaren blended a diverse range of materials and techniques to 
create an entirely new form of construct. Aaren's creations were capable
 of independent, creative thought, and even emotional behavior. These 
were the first true warforged.</p>
<p align="left">The warforged possessed many advantages over traditional
 constructs. Aaren had incorporated organic material into their design, 
binding steel and stone together with a flexible material similar to the
 roots of livewood trees. These binding roots could be rapidly grown 
within a creation forge, reducing the cost of production; they also 
responded to traditional healing magic, though these spells were not as 
effective on the warforged as they were on creatures of flesh and blood.</p>
<p align="left">Aaren was a dreamer, who sought to unravel the mysteries
 of life. But his father had other plans for his son's inventions. Here 
was the tireless soldier the house had been seeking. Merrix adapted the 
creation forges to use Aaren's designs, and soon the house was producing
 platoons of armored constructs, which were indoctrinated into service 
as soon as they emerged from the forges. During this time, the term 
"warforged" was coined, since Merrix sought to hammer a martial purpose 
into these constructs from the moment of birth. Aaren protested what he 
saw as the abuse and enslavement of his creations, but his pleas were 
ignored. In 970 YK, Aaren was excoriated -- formally disinherited from 
House Cannith. Merrix d'Cannith adopted his grandson, who was also named
 Merrix; in time, this boy would become House Cannith's Baron of Sharn.</p>
<p align="left">Following his expulsion, Aaren disappeared. His fate 
remains a mystery, and diviners and inquisitives have found no traces of
 him. Most believe that Aaren is long dead, but a number of conflicting 
stories present other possibilities. Some say that Aaren still wanders 
the world, and that he is dong what he can to help warforged adjust to a
 life of peace. Others say that he went mad, and that he has entered the
 service of the sinister Lord of Blades. According to these tales, the 
Lord of Blades has salvaged a creation forge in the Mournland, and Aaren
 is using it to produce strange new warforged. And then some others 
claim that Aaren IS the Lord of Blades -- that he has crafted a suit of 
armor that makes him appear to be a warforged, or that he has found a 
way to transfer his consciousness into a warforged body. The truth is 
for the DM to decide, but should Aaren still live, an encounter with the
 legendary artificer could have important consequences for any warforged
 characters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Warforged Composition</b></p>
<p align="left">Warforged are formed in the creation forges, which channel the powers of Cannith heirs to produce effects similar to <i>major creation </i>and <i>fabricate</i>.
 The materials of the warforged are not truly natural; this is reflected
 by the ability of a warforged juggernaut to change its shape over time 
(growing spikes), or the fact that an armorer can repair a mithral 
warforged even when he doesn't have any mithral on hand. An important 
side effect of this is that if material is removed from the body of a 
warforged, it quickly degrades. As a result, stripping a warforged and 
selling its metal is impossible; a warforged may have adamantine 
components, but these will rust and pit when they are pulled from the 
warforged.</p>
<p align="left">The warforged are made using a blend of materials. The 
core of a warforged is a frame formed from wood, stone, or metal. 
Bundles of rootlike fibers surround the core and serve as the muscles of
 the construct. Plates of steel and wood are fused over this layer of 
tendrils, forming the hard outer shell of the warforged. The precise 
appearance and construction of the body depends on the model of the 
warforged, as represented by its initial feats. This also affects the 
weight of the warforged, as shown below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Composite Plating:</b> A warforged with the default 
composite plating has a base height of 5'10", with a +2d6 height 
modifier, base weight of 270 pounds, and weight modifier of x4.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adamantine Body:</b> Its base weight is 320 pounds, 
with a weight modifier of x6. While adamantine itself is no heavier than
 steel, a warforged with this feat is typically more massive than other 
models, with more steel and stone in its construction.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Darkwood Body or Mithral Body:</b> Its base weight is
 180 pounds, with a weight modifier of x2. These materials are unusually
 light, and these warforged tend to be lean and flexible.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unarmored Body:</b> Its base weight is 225 pounds, 
with a weight modifier of x3. A warforged with this feat is covered with
 composite plating, but these plates are extremely thin and do not 
interfere with movement or spellcasting.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Insignia </b></p>
<p align="left">After emerging from the forge, most of the warforged 
were marked with symbols indicating the military specialty and national 
allegiance, so soldiers could identify their allies on the battlefield. 
In the years following the war, most warforged have had these insignia 
removed. However, some have left these symbols intact out of 
indifference or nostalgia. A character can identify warforged military 
insignia with a successful Profession (soldier) or Knowledge (history) 
skill check (DC 10). These symbols can be altered or concealed with the 
Disguise skill, or removed by any armorsmith.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Ghulra</b></p>
<p align="left">Composition and insignia are elements that many 
warforged may share. But every warforged has one unique feature: the 
sigil engraved on its forehead. These symbols are as individual as human
 fingerprints, and if a warforged possesses the ability to cast <i>arcane mark, </i>its
 personal mark will be the same as the sigil on its forehead. These 
symbols were not designed by human hands. When Aaren d'Cannith's first 
construct emerged from the creation forge, it bore a symbol on its 
forehead, and the second had a different sigil. Aaren's dedicated 
dwarven magewrights called these symbols "ghulra," a Dwarven word for 
"truth."</p>
<p align="left">Warforged adopt names to deal with humans, but when 
dealing with each other, the ghulra serves as an important form of 
identification. A warforged may wear a hood to conceal its forehead from
 strangers, but when among friends most prefer to leave the symbol 
visible. While someone could gouge away the symbol, the ghulra is a part
 of the warforged in a way nobody truly understands; when someone uses <i>repair </i>or <i>cure</i>
 spells on the warforged, a damaged ghulra is restored to its original 
shape. While it cannot be permanently destroyed, a warforged can cover 
its ghulra or may choose to use Disguise to place a false mark over its 
real one.</p>
