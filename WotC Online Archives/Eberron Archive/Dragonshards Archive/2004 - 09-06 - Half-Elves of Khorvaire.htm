<p align="right"><i>"Aerenal and Sarlona met in Khorvaire, and we are 
the fruit of that union. We may have no kings, no countries to call our 
own, but we are the true children of this land."</i></p>
<p align="right"> -- Arilam d'Lyrandar, captain of the airship<i> Bright Wind </i></p>
<p align="left">Almost 2,600 years ago, the nation of Aerenal was torn 
apart by civil war. Tensions between the clerics of the Undying Court 
and the necromancers of the House of Vol had grown with each new 
generation, but the manifestation of the Mark of Death and the discovery
 of half-dragons within the House of Vol were enough to set a spark to 
the bonfire. Soon the dragons of Argonnessen joined the fray, and when 
the conflict had settled, the line of Vol was no more. </p>
<p align="left">The Aereni had engaged in many battles against the 
dragons but this was the first civil war in the nation's history, and it
 left deep scars on the psyche of the elves. In the aftermath of the 
conflict, a number of elves chose to leave Aerenal to seek a new future 
in the land of Khorvaire. The elves of House Phiarlan led this exodus; 
while the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court had taken no action 
against the Mark of Shadow, the destruction of the Mark of Death was 
unsettling. Most of the immigrants felt that an unspoken promise had 
been broken by the civil war and that the elven blood spilled on the 
soil of Aerenal forever tainted the land.</p>
<p align="left">As the elves of House Phiarlan and the other scions of 
Aerenal spread across Khorvaire, they encountered the current occupants 
of the land: humans whose ancestors had traveled from Sarlona in search 
of riches and opportunity. The humans were fascinated by the elves. Many
 coveted the fey beauty and arcane secrets of the travelers, and many of
 the vagabond elves married into human guilds and noble families. Most 
elves saw this as a long-term investment. The elves were accustomed to 
looking centuries ahead, and having learned of the short human lifespan,
 an elven spouse had an excellent chance of inheriting control of family
 resources. Few elves imagined that they could conceive a child with a 
human until the first half-elves were born. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Children of Khorvaire</b></p>
<p align="left">Those elves that mingled with humans had typically 
married into privileged families, so that the first generation of 
half-elves was born with power and influence. For the most part, human 
parents were overjoyed with their unusual children, while elves saw the 
half-elves as pale reflections and mockeries of their ancestors. Many of
 the elves chose to back away from their human alliances and withdraw to
 the enclaves of House Phiarlan. If not for this desire to preserve 
their racial heritage, it is likely that the elves would have far 
greater influence across the modern nations of Khorvaire. Even as the 
true elves pulled back, the young half-elves spread across Khorvaire, 
embracing its many wonders. While they were bound to different houses 
and bloodlines, the majority felt a strong bond to other half-elves. 
Most sought to marry other half-elves, in the process forming new and 
stronger alliances between their families and guilds; this stability 
helped to lay the foundations of the Five Nations. </p>
<p align="left">While most half-elves remained among their human 
ancestors, they clung to the language and some of the traditions of the 
distant elves. As their numbers grew and their blood ties to the elves 
grew more distant, they developed their own traditions, eventually 
coming to seek a name beyond "half-elf." The most common is <i>Khoravar</i>.
 Like Valenar, this word is both an adjective and a noun; one can refer 
to "a Khoravar airship" or "that silver-tongued Khoravar."</p>
<p align="left">Over the course of centuries, the Khoravar grew in 
number and spread across the land. Most maintained close ties to their 
human kin but a few split off to form isolated half-elven communities. 
These seeds would grow into the Greensingers of the Eldeen Reaches and 
the Gray Sails of the Lhazaar Principalities. The turning point for the 
Khoravar was the appearance of the half-elven dragonmarks: the Mark of 
Storm in Thrane, followed by the Mark of Detection in Breland. In the 
wake of the War of the Mark and the foundation of Galifar, these houses 
gave the half-elves a focus for racial pride. </p>
<p align="left">Today, the majority of the Khoravar are attached to 
House Medani or House Lyrandar. Some remain spread throughout the noble 
families and guilds of Khorvaire. These half-elves are often called upon
 to serve as ambassadors and emissaries to Aerenal and Valenar. To date,
 the full-blooded elves have ruled that a Khoravar cannot join the 
Undying Court or embody one of the ancestors of the Valenar; the elves 
acknowledge, however, that the Khoravar blood is stronger than that of 
the human, and in time a dedicated half-elf may break through this 
prejudice. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Half-Elven Blood</b></p>
<p align="left">The genetics of the Khoravar are unusual. Many 
alchemists and sages are amazed that it is possible for humans and elves
 to interbreed at all. When a human and half-elf conceive, the resulting
 child has an equal chance to have the race of either parent. In all 
other cases -- human and elf, half-elf and half-elf, and elf and 
half-elf -- the result is always the same: a half-elf child. The Aereni 
claim that this is not a matter of physiology or genetics, but of magic;
 the blood of the elves holds the light of ancient Xen'drik, and once 
diluted it can never be regained. Whether this is true is a matter for 
each DM to decide. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Khoravar Customs</b></p>
<p align="left">Half-elves are highly adaptable, drawing on the culture 
of their families and the nations that they inhabit. Each of the 
Khoravar dragonmark houses has its own traditions, which will be 
explored further in the future. A few common customs bind most 
half-elves together. If you are playing a half-elf character or 
portraying a half-elf NPC, you must decide whether to make use of these 
traditions. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Khoravar Cant</b>. If a half-elf is raised by 
Khoravar parents, he will learn to speak both Common and Elvish. Each 
new generation of half-elves has a greater tendency to mingle the 
vocabulary of both languages, creating a pidgin dialect that some 
linguists refer to as Khoravar Cant. Any half-elf can understand this 
dialect perfectly. Any other character must make an Intelligence check 
to understand a phrase in Khoravar Cant (DC 5 if the listener 
understands both Common and Elvish, or DC 10 if he only knows one of the
 two languages). If the listener fails the check by a point or two, he 
may get the gist of the conversation; the worse the roll, the less he 
understands.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Half-Elven Hospitality. </b>The Khoravar are a young 
race, and they have had to stand by one another to earn a place in 
Khorvaire. As a result, there is a strong tradition of hospitality and 
generosity toward others of the race. This is not as strong as the bond 
between the gnome families of Zilargo, and a half-elf need not put 
himself at physical or financial risk for a complete stranger. In 
comparison to the other races, however, half-elves will go out of their 
way to help one another and share news and information. This is a 
two-way street. If the PC develops a reputation as an adventurer or 
hero, other half-elves may ask for his assistance or advice. If he 
provides aid, his reputation will spread; if he turns down these 
requests, he may eventually find himself spurned by others of his kind. </p>
<p align="left">Within a city or town, half-elves often have weekly gatherings (called <i>unity meals</i>)
 to discuss local news and events. Provided a PC has a good reputation, 
such a gathering would be an excellent place to learn information. At 
the DM's discretion, attending a unity meal can provide a character with
 a bonus to Gather Information or Knowledge (local) or allow the party 
to find a reliable hireling at a good rate. It can also be a place to 
learn about possible adventures or mysteries. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Bridge Between. </b>Many half-elves extend the 
principle of hospitality a step further, seeking to serve as a bridge 
between the different cultures of Khorvaire. Many become bards, 
barristers, diplomats, chroniclers, translators, or merchants. Others 
become explorers, hoping to discover new nations hidden in the depths of
 Xen'drik or Khyber. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Questions to Ask</b></p>
<p align="left">When you create a half-elf PC or NPC, consider the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Khoravar have a history stretching back to the birth of the 
race. Were you born into this community or are you a "newborn" -- that 
is, were your parents half-elves or are you the child of a human and an 
elf? If you are a newborn, do you want to become a part of the half-elf 
community or do you want to find your own way in the world? <br><br></li>
<li>Do you have ties to House Medani or House Lyrandar? Because of the 
age of the race, many Khoravar can trace their roots to one of the 
families, and even those with no direct tie often choose to ally 
themselves to one of the houses. This could be reflected by a dragonmark
 feat or the Favored in House feat, or it could simply be a point of 
backstory. <br><br></li>
<li>Which tradition do you follow? Are you interested in meeting others 
and strengthening relations between those around you or do you save your
 energy for your close friends and family? <br><br></li>
<li>Do you have any interest in your elvish heritage? Do you want to 
learn the ways of the Aereni or Valenar? Do you hope to join the Undying
 Court or channel a Valenar ancestor? <br><br></li>
<li>How large is your family? What about the other half-elves in your 
region? Do you have ties to the local community or are you a loner?</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">These are notions for consideration, nothing more. Keep 
them in mind when fashioning your character, but above all, build the 
character you want to play!</p>
