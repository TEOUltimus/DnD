<p align="left"><b>The Serpentine Table</b></p>
<p align="left">The elves of House Phiarlan are known across Khorvaire 
as master artisans and entertainers. House Phiarlan uses a five-headed 
hydra as its symbol, with a head for each of the five artistic demesnes:
 memory, motion, music, shape, and shadow. But while the hydra has five 
heads, it also has a shadow -- and this represents the Serpentine Table,
 the sixth demesne that lies hidden beneath the surface of the house. </p>
<p align="left">After the first war between Aerenal and Argonnessen, the
 rulers of Aerenal needed an elite force that could serve as the eyes 
and ears of the Undying Court. The phiarlans were already welcomed in 
every realm, and the Sibling Kings sought their aid. The elders of the 
Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi lines summoned their most cunning and 
capable heirs to serve at the Serpentine Table. For millennia this 
network of observers helped maintain order in Aerenal, until the 
appearance of the Mark of Shadows pushed the phiarlans into disfavor. 
The elves brought the Serpentine Table to Khorvaire, where its roots 
spread across the land. </p>
<p align="left">Few know where to find the citadel of the Serpentine 
Table, and the DM must decide where to place it in his campaign. Every 
Phiarlan enclave has an observer who serves as a liaison with the Table,
 and this person arranges jobs and ensures that the local heirs of the 
house do not interfere with Serpentine operations. But the actual agents
 of the Table are hidden even from this liaison; they are often 
scattered throughout the community and concealed behind layer upon layer
 of false identity. The true spymaster of a major city weaves her web in
 the shadows, and no one should ever know her connection to the house. </p>
<p align="left">Not all of the spies of House Phiarlan belong to the 
Serpentine Table. Many independents broke away during the Thuranni feud,
 but a few private cabals remain -- proud families and independent 
adventurers who prefer to operate outside of the strict hierarchy of the
 house. As long as these groups maintain the honor of the house and do 
not interfere with Serpentine operations, they are left in peace.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hiring the House</b></p>
<p align="left">The artistic endeavors of House Phiarlan fill the house 
coffers with gold. From a purely financial standpoint, the house could 
survive without selling the services of its spies. But there is more to 
the world than gold. Kings, cardinals, and dragonmark barons rely on the
 Serpentine Table, and the house thrives on the influence it gains 
through its actions. By choosing what jobs to accept and which to 
decline, the Serpentine Table has the power to shape Khorvaire. Every 
act -- from the assassination of an upstart general to the recovery of a
 stolen heirloom for a wealthy merchant -- increases the power of the 
house. Only the lords of the Serpentine Table know how the house plans 
to use this power. </p>
<p align="left">House Phiarlan may not rely on the Serpentine Table for 
its gold, but that doesn't mean that the services of Serpentine spies 
come cheaply. The house prefers to deal with powerful and influential 
people, and the blacksmith who wants to spy on his wayward wife should 
hire an inquisitive from House Tharashk.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Information Gathering: </b>The hidden citadel of the 
Serpentine Table houses a corps of diviners, and its identity vault 
holds locks of hair and personal items taken from thousands of the most 
important people of Khorvaire. <i>Serpentine mirrors</i> empower and 
enhance the powers of the Mark of Shadow, and dragonmark diviners devote
 their time to shadow-gazing and spying through the ether. Phiarlan 
observers pass information to Serpentine handlers, who communicate with 
the lords of the Table with <i>scrystones</i>. And every day the knowledge of the house grows.</p>
<p align="left">An old secret that one could find elsewhere with effort 
-- the name of a former king's mistress, which could also be pried from 
the vaults of the Library of Korranberg -- usually costs 10 to 100 gp. 
However, the price could go up based on the impact the secret may have. 
If the name of the mistress could reveal a forgotten heir who could 
unseat King Boranel, the Serpentine Table could raise its price a 
hundredfold -- or refuse to reveal it at all.</p>
<p align="left">Information that can be acquired through the use of <i>scrying</i>
 has a base cost of 280 gp. Long-term magical surveillance generally 
costs 2,000 gp/day. However, the house has a limited number of focus 
items that can sustain extended surveillance, and this service may not 
be available at all times.</p>
<p align="left">Beyond scrying, the Table relies on agents in the field.
 If a spy is already in place and can acquire the desired information 
without risk, a secret might cost 100 gp. A complex operation requiring a
 dozen of elves to put their lives on the line -- say, an extraction 
from Dreadhold -- could cost tens of thousands of gold pieces. 
Ultimately DM must decide the price based on the resources the task 
requires and the impact the action will have on the campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Protection: </b>A continual stream of information 
flows through House Phiarlan, and a client can pay a monthly fee to be 
alerted about any activity that poses a threat to her or relates to a 
subject of her choosing. Depending on the depth of the coverage, this 
can cost thousands of gold pieces, and few people take advantage of it. 
But when a party of adventurers plots against a wealthy criminal, 
there's always the chance that she'll receive a telepathic <i>scrystone </i>warning from House Phiarlan!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Violence and Theft:</b> House Phiarlan has no special
 dispensation to break the law, and a captured Serpentine assassin will 
suffer the same consequences as any other criminal. Serpentine liaisons 
require full disclosure about the reasons driving an assignment. 
Assassination requires excellent justification, and the house never 
kills or kidnaps a client in good standing -- one of the reasons rulers 
prefer to work with the house instead of against it. They are more 
willing to abduct than kill; House Phiarlan may not kill a band of 
adventurers for robbing a noble, but the elves might capture the party 
and leave their fate in the hands of the victim. Agents of the 
Serpentine Table do steal from one client on behalf of another, but only
 with good reason -- never simply to fulfill a client's greed. House 
Phiarlan also perform other criminal acts under the right circumstances,
 but organizations like the Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864200000">Sharn: City of Towers</a></i>) are the primary sources of thieves and assassins. </p>
<p align="left">The power of the Serpentine Table does have limits. 
House Phiarlan has spies hidden within the Aurum, Order of the Emerald 
Claw, or the Twelve. But the Lords of Dust, Dreaming Dark, and the 
Chamber are ancient and powerful forces with excellent 
counterintelligence. House Phiarlan can't watch every cult of the Dragon
 Below or every Dhakaani clan. The Serpentine Table doesn't have agents 
in every thorp or guild. Ultimately, the DM must decide what House 
Phiarlan knows and what has been successfully hidden from their prying 
eyes. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Serving the Shadow</b></p>
<p align="left">Many members of House Phiarlan serve as passive agents 
of the house. In addition to passing information to the Serpentine 
liaison, Phiarlan elves may assist the Table in many other ways. The 
celebrated actress may be too busy to serve as an active spy and 
assassin, but she can give Serpentine agents a place in her entourage --
 or help a spy assume her identity for a particular mission. </p>
<p align="left">A player character -- even one with the Favored in House
 feat -- must earn a place with the Serpentine Table. If he shows 
potential, the Serpentine Table asks him to serve as an observer 
initially. This duty calls for him to pass along information he acquires
 on his adventures, and it encourages him to make contacts that could 
prove useful to the house. In time, he is given small assignments and 
missions that tie into a particular adventure. On a dungeon delve, he 
might be asked to swap a particular piece of treasure with a forgery 
provided by the house and then return the true treasure to the house. He
 could be given a package to deliver to an innkeeper along the road, an 
amulet to slip into a nobleman's purse, or a <i>scrying beacon </i>to 
place in a critical location. If he performs admirably, he eventually 
may be inducted as a shadow of the Serpentine Table. At this point his 
missions may form the basis for entire adventures.</p>
<p align="left">No membership dues exist for members of the Serpentine 
Table; on the contrary, agents are paid a regular salary, along with 
generous rewards for dangerous missions. The ranks within the house are 
described below. As a general rule, a Serpentine agent must have ranks 
in three or more of the following skills: Bluff, Disguise, Gather 
Information, Hide, Knowledge (any), Listen, Move Silently, Open Lock, 
Search, or Spot. Exceptions may be made for spellcasters whose magical 
abilities make up for their lack of training.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shadows </b>are the least agents of the Table. To 
hold this position, a character must have seven or more ranks in three 
of the Serpentine skills. Shadows receive 10 gp each month as a retainer
 in addition to bonuses for completing tasks. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wraiths</b> are gifted agents who often coordinate 
groups of shadows. A wraith must possess nine or more ranks in four of 
the Serpentine skills. Wraiths receive 50 gp each month as a retainer. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Spectres</b> are elite troubleshooters. A spectre 
must possess twelve or more ranks in four of the Serpentine skills, and 
she receives 200 gp each month as a retainer. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghosts </b>are the legends of the house. Only a 
handful of these agents exist, and their identities are carefully 
guarded. A ghost needs to have fifteen or more ranks in four of the 
Serpentine skills. A ghost receives 1,000 gp each month as a retainer 
and has access to many resources within the house. However, as the top 
agents of the house, ghosts are almost always on assignment -- a PC who 
rises to this rank will have little time for random adventures. </p>
<p align="left">Above the ghosts are the lords of the Serpentine Table. 
An elf cannot rise to this position based on skill alone; she must serve
 the house for centuries before she can even be considered for induction
 into the inner circle. The lords are not necessarily as powerful as the
 ghosts, but what they lack in character level they make up for in 
cunning and wisdom. </p>
<p align="left">Only elves of House Phiarlan have ever been accepted as 
members of the Serpentine Table, and this is unlikely to change. People 
of all races and nations may be used as tools and observers, but they 
are never treated as equals or brought into the confidence of the Table.
 In the case of a player character, his adventuring companions are seen 
as assets he brings to the house. An elf can gain status within House 
Phiarlan by assisting the Serpentine Table. But if he chooses to become a
 full agent of the Serpentine Table, he can have no loyalty above the 
house. </p>
