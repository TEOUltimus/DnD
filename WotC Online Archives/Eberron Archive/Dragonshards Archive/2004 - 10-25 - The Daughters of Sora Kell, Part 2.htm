<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="LEFT">Individually, the Daughters of Sora Kell are three of 
the most powerful beings on Khorvaire. Sora Maenya and Sora Katra are 
monsters of legend, and this should be taken into account when dealing 
with them. Through Sora Teraza, they will probably already know much 
about the adventurers before they ever encounter them; a DM should make 
full use of this knowledge. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Sora Katra </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>NE Female half-fiend green hag, Bard 11</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Renowned in song as the trickster of the deep swamp, 
Sora Katra has been a figure in Brelish folktales for centuries. Stories
 abound of those who have gone to her in search of secrets or treasure, 
planning to best her with wit or steel. With few exceptions, these tales
 always come to a bad end. Her charisma and skill with words are 
remarkable, and while the threat of violence forms the foundation of 
Droaam, Sora Katra's rhetoric is quickly building a fanatical following 
for the hags.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When all three of the hags are encountered, Sora Katra will do most of the talking. She uses <i>disguise self</i>
 constantly, choosing forms to distract or disorient her opponents. She 
sees the world as a vast gameboard and is always playing out dozens of 
schemes. One of her primary tools is a criminal organization known as 
Daask (a giant word translating as "monstrous eye"), which has spread 
east through Breland and Aundair. More information about this 
organization can be found in the upcoming sourcebook <i>Sharn: The City of Towers. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition to her powers as a hag and half-fiend, Sora Katra possesses a legendary talent for curses. Once per day she can <i>bestow curse </i>as a spell-like ability; once per month she can perform <i>binding</i>. She must supply the usual components for <i>binding.</i> She performs these spells as a 20th level bard, and the save DCs are Charisma based. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Sora Teraza</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>LN Female half-fiend dusk hag, Cleric 13</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">There are few legends of Sora Teraza. Until the founding
 of Droaam, only the most erudite bards had heard of the blind crone 
said to wander the Demon Wastes. Many believe that she is the motivating
 force behind Droaam -- that she was the one who sought out her sisters,
 guided by an oracular vision. She speaks rarely, but her sisters pay 
close attention to every word. </p>
<p align="LEFT">All dusk hags possess oracular abilities, but Sora 
Teraza's are unnaturally powerful. However, she does not control these 
visions; instead, the visions control her, as she seems to feel an 
obligation to fulfill the visions she receives. This is a tool for the 
DM, and there is no mechanic attached to it. It is a plot device to 
serve the needs of the campaign. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Although she is blind, Sora Teraza is aware of all that 
occurs around her; this is represented by blindsight that extends in a 
60-foot radius. She cannot be flanked or caught flat-footed.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Sora Maenya</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>NE Female half-fiend annis, Barbarian 10</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sora Maenya has terrorized the Eldeen Reaches for 
generations. Her strength and appetite are legendary, and she is said to
 have wrestled the dragon Saerylak and devoured him raw. Few creatures 
have survived her iron grip, and she takes personal pleasure in breaking
 giants and other monsters that challenge the Daughters. Over the 
centuries she has devoured shifter tribes and left entire villages 
barren and empty. She takes great pleasure in hunting rangers and other 
human prey. While many Droaamites adore Sora Katra, far more fear Sora 
Maenya.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While Sora Maenya is known for her strength, she is no 
dumb brute. She lets Sora Katra run the nation but Sora Maenya is a 
cunning orator in her own right. She prefers to ply her skills on 
individuals, playing games with her prey before tearing them to shreds. 
She is also an unbridled sensualist, and she is always searching for new
 tastes and experiences. Of all the sisters, Sora Maenya is most likely 
to be encountered alone, as she wanders the wilds in search of bloody 
entertainment. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Sora Maenya prefers to fight with her hands; she enjoys 
the sensation of crushing bones and rending flesh. However, when leading
 her war trolls into battle, she may choose to use a battle axe or 
greatsword. The Daughters have many magical weapons hidden in the vaults
 beneath the Great Crag. </p>

10/magic, DR 2/bludgeoning, and DR 2/--. Her natural weapons are 
considered to be magic weapons for purposes of overcoming damage 
reduction. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Soul Binding (Su): </b>By taking an hour to devour a 
corpse and perform a special ritual, Sora Maenya can trap the soul of 
her victim. This is identical to the spell <i>soul bind</i> except that 
the soul is bound in the victim's skull instead of a gem, and the ritual
 can be performed within 17 hours of death. The effect has a caster 
level of 17. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>3/day -- <i>darkness, disguise self </i>(CL 8th), <i>fog cloud</i> (CL 8th), <i>poison </i>(DC 16)<i>, unholy aura </i>(DC 20)<i>; </i>1/day -- <i>blasphemy</i> (DC 19)<i>, contagion</i> (DC 16)<i>, desecrate, horrid wilting </i>(17d6, DC 20)<i>, summon monster IX </i>(night hag), <i>unhallow, unholy blight </i>(8d8, DC 16)<i>. </i>Caster level is 17th unless otherwise stated and save DCs are Charisma-based. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rage: </b>While raging, Sora Maenya gains 34 
temporary hit points. The following changes should be put in effect; AC 
29, touch 12, flat-footed 29; Atk +36 melee (1d6+19, claws); Full Atk

1d6+19, rend 2d6+27; SV Fort +16, Will +13; Str 44, Con 24. Her rage 
lasts for 11 rounds.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>Though her hunched posture hides her true size, this 
withered crone must be at least 8 feet tall. She wears a hooded cloak 
and leather rags the color of dried blood. Her limbs are long and 
gnarled, but her hands do not shake and her fingers are tipped by long 
black talons. Her withered skin is a deep indigo blue, and her hair a 
filthy black nest. Her eyes glow with a fierce red light, and when she 
smiles you see the mass of needle-sharp teeth that fill her mouth. </i></p>
