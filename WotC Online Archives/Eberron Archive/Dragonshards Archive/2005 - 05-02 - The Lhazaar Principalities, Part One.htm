<p align="left">The Lhazaar Principalities stretch across the eastern 
coast of Khorvaire. The islands northeast of the Hoarfrost Mountains are
 dark and cold, while the winters are long and the sun a rare visitor. 
These isles are the source of many sinister tales; living in the long 
shadow, one can easily imagine ghost ships prowling the waters and 
lich-lords hiding in the mountains. To the south, steaming jungles cover
 the Lhazaar islands; the land is home to deadly dinosaurs, and colossal
 sea serpents are said to lurk beneath the waves. From the frigid north 
to the southern tropics, these are hard lands that produce hard people.</p>
<p align="left">The Lhazaar region draws its name from the Sarlonan 
explorer and pirate who colonized Greentarn, Orgalos, and Cape Far. 
Despite her fame, Lhazaar was neither the first nor last pioneer to 
settler along the eastern coast of Khorvaire. Over two dozen large 
islands are in the Principalities, and a remarkable range of people have
 found their way to the eastern shore. Gnome explorers from Zilargo 
claimed the isle of Lorghalen long before Lhazaar made her crossing. Elf
 refugees from the Aereni civil war found solace in the icy solitude of 
Farlnen. Dwarves and orcs from the Ironroot Mountains migrated to the 
eastern shore, laying the foundations of Tantamar and Cliffscrape. And 
dozens of human expeditions followed in the wake of Lhazaar, with most 
being Sarlonan explorers and fugitives from nations since destroyed by 
the Riedran Empire. The islanders have come together over the centuries,
 forming cosmopolitan communities and common traditions.</p>
<p align="left">Despite the blend of races and cultures that have come 
together to form the Principalities, Lhazaar's influence can still be 
felt. It was Lhazaar who organized the first raider fleets, leading 
expeditions against Zil merchants and the ships of the dying Dhakaani 
Empire. Lhazaar granted her best captains the rank of praelas -- a 
Riedran rank translated as "prince" in the Common tongue -- proclaiming 
herself to be the prince among princes. She established the few laws 
that are universal throughout the realm, notably the fact that the title
 of prince is not hereditary. By the edicts, a Lhazaar noble holds his 
post through the power of his fleet and ability to command. Should he 
slip on either count, a more capable leader can lay claim to his title 
and his lands. Over the centuries, a number of principalities have 
adapted this custom to their own traditions; the gnomes of Lorghalen 
allow would-be princes to challenge a ruler to games of wit and tests of
 strategy, while the Farlnen elves expect a prince to possess arcane 
skill in addition to naval power.</p>
<p align="left">The Lhazaar princes have always been willful and 
independent, and the history of the region is filled with feuds between 
princes. Powerful alliances have risen and fallen, but the islands have 
never been fully united under one prince. There has always been at least
 one lord who has claimed the title of high prince. This claim usually 
reflects the power of the lord's fleet, and as a result the high prince 
usually has the respect of the other princes -- but this doesn't make 
his word law. He can make requests of the other princes, but unless he 
intends to use force, he cannot make demands. </p>
<p align="left">In the present day, the high prince is Rygar ir'Wynarn, 
the lord of Greentarn. A clever diplomat and brilliant captain, Rygar 
has earned the loyalty of a host of warriors and the respect of most of 
the princes; those who oppose him do so quietly. Rygar called together 
the delegation that represented the Principalities in the Treaty of 
Thronehold, and he hopes to one day rule as the true king of the seas. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Law of the Isles</b></p>
<p align="left">Few laws bind all citizens of the Principalities. 
Despite the long history of the isles, the Lhazaar Principalities have 
never subscribed to a comprehensive system of laws on par with the Code 
of Galifar. According to Lhazaar's edicts, temporal power rests in the 
hands of the prince: Each lord has the right to administer justice in 
his domain, appointing officers as he sees fit. As a result, customs 
vary significantly from principality to principality. High Prince Rygar 
goes to great pains to maintain order in Regalport, creating a safe 
environment for foreign emissaries and traders. But Port Krez in Krag is
 a wild and dangerous place for outsiders, where street justice is the 
common answer to social transgressions.</p>
<p align="left">The Lhazaarites are an independent folk: They serve the 
prince at sea, but they don't want to be ordered about on land. Most 
Lhazaarites have little interest in the laws of other nations. A Lhazaar
 proverb states "no man owns the sea," and it's this indifference that 
fuels the tradition of piracy; a Lhazaar captain believes that he 
deserves whatever he can take, and whether he acts under the legitimacy 
of a letter of marque is a matter of convenience. The growing naval 
power of Galifar forced the Lhazaarites to limit their larcenous 
actions, but this was a matter of pragmatism as opposed to principle: 
With the Five Nations weakened by war, many Lhazaar captains have 
returned to the ways of their forefathers. This attitude often causes 
trouble for Lhazaarites traveling in other lands, since few feel bound 
by the laws of foreign kings. Despite these chaotic tendencies, most 
Lhazaarites are fiercely loyal to family, friends, and other members of 
their own principality. If one sailor kills another in a brawl, the 
matter might be completely ignored. But if a foreigner kills a 
Lhazaarite, the entire community may rise up in outrage. Ties between 
the Principalities are tenuous, with alliances and feuds changing with 
the winds. But the princes still unite to defend a prince against an 
outsider. It is this loyalty that serves as a shield for raiders like 
Prince Mika's Cloudreavers; if one of the Five Nations actually sent a 
fleet into the Principalities, they would soon face an alliance of 
princes.</p>
<p align="left">While the reins of power can shift as swiftly as the 
tides, much of the social hierarchy of Lhazaar society operates 
independently of the prince. While the prince has the power to appoint 
or dismiss ministers and sheriffs, it is rare for a prince to clear 
house in this manner; these landbound officials are in many ways a 
separate class, and this continuity is what allows life to continue 
smoothly through the frequent transitions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Customs of the Lhazaar Principalities</b></p>
<p align="left">The water is a way of life for the people of the 
Principalities. Lhazaar children learn to fish and harvest the bounty of
 the sea as soon as they are old enough to handle a net, and most are 
equally at home on the deck of a ship or swimming through the waves. 
Most Lhazaarites prefer to stay close to the water: the ocean is 
freedom, and a Lhazaarite deep inland feels isolated and trapped. 
Lhazaarites prefer fish and salty foods to red meat, and Lhazaar 
captains traditionally drink salasta, a strong, clear alcoholic beverage
 made using salas seaweed.</p>
<p align="left">The ancestors of the Lhazaarites came from many 
different races and nations. There is a wide range of skin and hair 
color among the humans; the original settlers came from across Sarlona, 
from desert, jungle, and plains. As a result, Lhazaarites tend to be 
comfortable with all races, and their culture and language incorporates 
traces of many others; while a dwarf born in the Lhazaar Principalities 
may not be able to speak Elven, he may use Elven swear words or 
interjections in his speech. Many of the humans of tge western 
Principalities learn Riedran, which is fundamentally the language of Old
 Sarlona -- though a Lhazaar accent is quite different from that of an 
Inspired lord. The people of Orgalos have kept Riedran as their primary 
language and consider Common to be the language of Galifar; over the 
course of the last century the princes of Orgalos have formed strong 
ties with the Inspired, and much of the local Riedran trade passes 
through Piritar.</p>
<p align="left">Lhazaar dress varies from principality to principality, 
but it often shows traces of the polyglot heritage of the region. 
Clothing tends to be tough and functional since it's made to resist the 
rough weather of the seas and the bitter cold of the northern winter. 
Lhazaarites take great pride in their hair, and complex braids and 
decorative accessories are common among both men and women.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Feats</b></p>
<p align="left">You can include the following feats in your game; a 
player should work with her DM to ensure that these feats are 
appropriate for the DM's personal campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expert Swimmer</b></p>
<p align="left">You swim like a fish. You can stay underwater far longer than others of your race, and you are at home in the water.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Swim 4 ranks, Endurance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> You can hold your breath for 3 rounds 
per point of Constitution. You gain a +4 bonus on Constitution checks 
made to continue holding your breath. On a successful Swim check, you 
swim your land speed (as a full-round action) or half your land speed 
(as a move action).</p>
<p align="left">Your natural swim speed is increased by 10 feet, if you have a swim speed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Normal:</b> You can hold your breath for a number of 
rounds equal to twice your Constitution before you are at risk of 
drowning. On a successful Swim check, you swim half your land speed as a
 full-round action, or one-quarter your land speed as a move action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Old Salt</b></p>
<p align="left">You are an old hand at shipboard life, having mastered 
the myriad skills that are required of the experienced sailor. 
Additionally, you have an eye for the weather.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Profession (sailor) 5 ranks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> You gain a +1 bonus on Balance, Profession (sailor), and Use Rope checks. </p>
<p align="left">Additionally, you may use a Profession (sailor) check to
 predict the weather (as described under the Survival skill on page 83 
in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Normal:</b> Survival is normally used to predict the weather.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ship's Mage</b></p>
<p align="left">You form a potent supernatural bond with a ship. Your 
spells have a more potent effect when cast aboard this ship. 
Spellcasters who possess this feat are greatly favored as ship crew.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Profession (sailor) 2 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> Add +1 to the caster level of all spells
 cast while you are aboard a ship that is familiar to you. In addition, 
spells you cast while aboard a ship that is familiar to you deal no 
damage to that ship.</p>
<p align="left">It takes one week of living and working aboard a ship to
 become familiar with it. You may be familiar with only one ship at a 
time; the familiarity with a particular ship fades should you become 
familiar with another ship. </p>
<p align="left">Additionally, should you remain away from the ship you are familiar with for more than a month, that familiarity fades as well.</p>
