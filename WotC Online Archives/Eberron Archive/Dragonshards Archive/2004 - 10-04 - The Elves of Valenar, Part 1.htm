<p align="left"><i>The Darguul warlord studied Caerys, slowly spinning 
the chain of his flail. "What could bring you to this place, elf?" His 
tribe gathered around them, forming a wide circle of shadows and 
gleaming red eyes.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Caerys held her double blade in the falcon guard, 
level with her shoulders and spreading out like wings. "I came in search
 of legends. Ten thousand years ago Daealyth of Taeri stood this ground 
and faced your ancestors, and twenty fell before his singing blades. You
 are no Dhakaani of old, and a mere twenty of you will bring no honor to
 the Taeri."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The warlord hissed in fury, and his flail flashed in 
the firelight. The chain wrapped around Caerys' blade but she twisted 
away. The flail flew into the darkness. She spun forward, her double 
blade weaving a circle of fire as she danced toward the chieftain. In a 
moment the song of steel was over. </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Caerys watched as the warlord fell to the ground. 
With a contemptuous snap of her wrist, she flicked the blood from her 
blade into the eyes of the stunned onlookers. She smiled behind her 
spirit veil, counting the blades arrayed against her. </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"But forty will." </i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Heart and History</b></p>
<p align="left">Born in the land of Xen'drik, the elves learned the ways
 of civilization and magic as slaves of the giants. Ultimately Xen'drik 
collapsed in an apocalypse of dragon fire, giant magic, and elven steel.
 The creatures remaining on the continent were reduced to savagery. 
During the final days of Xen'drik, a visionary foresaw the fate of the 
doomed realm. On the eve of destruction, she led a few thousand elves 
across the sea. </p>
<p align="left">Those elves found a home on the island of Aerenal. While
 the elves came from different cultures, they were united by their 
reverence for their ancestors and the heroic deeds of those fallen in 
Xen'drik. The majority of the settlers chose to lay down the sword in 
favor of the book. They studied the art of magic, plumbing the depth of 
the arcane and the divine in their search for a way to preserve their 
heroes. Over the course of twelve thousand years, this effort produced 
the Undying Court and the Aereni. </p>
<p align="left">Until the Last War, few humans knew of the other culture
 of Aerenal: The Tairnadal, "proud warriors." When news reached Aerenal 
of the destruction wrought by the dragons and the downfall of their 
ancient enemies, the Tairnadal refused to lay down their weapons. Some 
cursed the dragons for stealing their rightful victory while others 
blamed the wyrms of Argonnessen for the deaths of elves left behind. 
While the Aereni sought a way to overcome death, Tairnadal priests 
declared that the spirits of departed heroes continued to live on 
through their descendents -- and that the warrior who gains glory in 
battle serves as an avatar for the heroes of the past.</p>
<p align="left">In -25,000 YK, the dragons came to Aerenal. Once again 
all elves joined together against a common foe. The conflict between 
Argonnessen and Aerenal was a fascinating and mysterious struggle but it
 is a subject far too deep for this current work. To the human eye, this
 war continued at a snail's pace, with centuries passing between 
battles. Slowly the emphasis shifted from physical conflict to magical 
warfare, with the greatest burden falling on the Undying Court itself. 
Temporarily freed from battle, the Tairnadal looked elsewhere for glory.
 Their eyes settled on Khorvaire. </p>
<p align="left">In -10,000 YK, Cassael Vadallia led a troop of warriors 
to the southern coast of Khorvaire, where the Tairnadal established a 
presence on the continent. These elves called themselves the Valaes 
Tairn, "warriors of glory." As the elves spread across the southwest, 
they came into contact with the goblinoid empire of Dhakaan. Isolated 
skirmishes soon turned to war. The Valaes Tairn were peerless warriors 
but the Dhakaani had excellent discipline and greater numbers. </p>
<p align="left">At the height of the Dhakaani-Tairn War, the dragons 
struck Aerenal with greater force than ever. The elves rushed to the 
defense of their homeland, and the goblins seized the fortresses left 
behind. The conflict that followed was long and terrible, made worse 
when the Dhakaani launched attacks against Aerenal. The elves could not 
afford to fight two foes. The leaders of the Tairnadal met with the 
Dhakaani, and a treaty was signed; the elves swore never to return to 
Khorvaire unless called upon for aid. </p>
<p align="left">They stood by their word. The Dhakaani were too proud to
 ask for assistance during the Daelkyr incursion, and even when the 
empire collapsed into ruin the Tairnadal remained on their island. For 
thousands of years the Valaes Tairn rebuilt their numbers and honed 
their skills -- until 914 YK, when a summons finally came. </p>
<p align="left">The call came from Queen Mishann of Cyre. The Last War 
was well underway, and the Cyrans were under attack from all sides. 
Intrigued by the queen's plea, war leader Shaeras Vadallia summoned the 
clans of the Valaes Tairn. The warriors agreed that it was time to 
return. </p>
<p align="left">For 42 years the Valaes Tairn spread terror across 
Breland and Karrnath. Then they broke all ties with Cyre. Some say that 
the young Queen Mishala insulted Vadallia, while others believe that the
 war leader simply grew tired of the alliance. Vadallia summoned his 
forces to the southeastern edge of Cyre. He spoke of the ancient claim 
of the elves, a bond to the land older than human civilization. As a 
darkwood crown was placed upon his brow, he swore to restore the lands 
claimed by his ancestor and to give all Tairnadal the chance for glory. 
Sinking his blade into the soil, he declared the foundation of Valenar, 
"the glorious realm." </p>
