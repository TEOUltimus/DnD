<p align="left">The adventure is going well . . . too well. Clever 
tactics and a few lucky critical hits have demolished encounters that 
were supposed to be major challenges, and unless something happens the 
adventure will come to an early and unsatisfying end. Enter the strike 
force. Depending on the needs of the night, these characters can be 
deadly adversaries, invaluable allies, or a way to add color to a scene.
 This article examines the Heirs of Dhakaan -- the elite warriors of 
Darguun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Structure and Tactics</b></p>
<p align="left">The Heirs of Dhakaan are the scions of a martial 
tradition that once dominated Khorvaire. For thousands of years they 
have been in hiding. Now they have returned. Dhakaani troops are among 
the most dangerous soldiers in Khorvaire; they are skilled, disciplined,
 well-equipped, and utterly devoted to their clans. If the clans were to
 come together under one leader, they might threaten Khorvaire itself. 
But for now they remain divided, squabbling among themselves to 
determine the rightful heir of Dhakaan. Some clans are engaged in 
full-scale wars against their brethren. Others comb the continent for 
relics of the ancient empire, believing that the symbolic and magical 
power of these items are the key to victory.</p>
<p align="left">The Dhakaani are far deadlier than their Ghaal'dar 
cousins, and they should prove an unpleasant surprise for a party used 
to savage or undisciplined humanoids. Dhakaani soldiers act with elegant
 precision, shifting targets or formations on a single word from their 
commanders. Dhakaani leaders are seasoned veterans who can analyze any 
situation and determine the most dangerous threats. They seek to 
incapacitate spellcasters as quickly as possible and combine attacks to 
eliminate foes.</p>
<p align="left">The weaknesses of this Dhakaani force include poor Will 
saves and a complete lack of divine magic, due to the agnostic nature of
 Dhakaani culture. The dirge singer can heal, and a taarka'khesh scout 
can attempt to use the Use Magic Device skill to trigger a <i>wand of cure light wounds</i>. But the lack of clerical support can prove a drawback against a well-balanced opponent or an undead foe.</p>
<p align="left">Whenever possible, Dhakaani scout the terrain before 
battle, spreading missile support into key locations and letting snipers
 take advantage of Plunging Shot. Stealthy bugbears draw close to the 
enemy before raging into battle, followed by the hobgoblin troopers. 
While the bugbears are taught to hurl themselves into the foe, the 
troopers use Combat Expertise and Improved Trip to harangue enemies. The
 dirge singer uses <i>hold person</i> or <i>confusion </i>against enemy melee champions and tanglefoot bags against obvious spellcasters, while inspiring her troops with bardic music.</p>
<p align="left">Between the poor Will saving throws of the melee troops and the potential of a <i>fireball</i>
 to devastate a group of soldiers, the rare wizards assigned to Dhakaani
 units generally take defensive roles: an evoker might start the battle 
with a <i>fireball</i>, but on subsequent rounds he'll hold his action 
for counterspelling until he's certain enemy spellcasters have been 
neutralized.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2006%20-%2001-09%20-%20Strike%20Force%20-%20Dhakaan_files/eb0109ds_dragonshards_darguun.jpg" border="1" height="259" width="400"></p>
<p align="left"><b>Dhakaani Encounters</b></p>
<p align="left">You can add a Dhakaani strike force into an adventure in many ways. Consider the following possibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>The party has been sent to plunder a Dhakaani ruin. When they 
arrive, a goblinoid troop is already camped around the entrance and 
exploring the dungeon.</li>
<li>After the party emerges from a dungeon, they are challenged by a 
Dhakaani force: The leader demands that the adventurers hand over a 
Dhakaani relic they have stolen.</li>
<li> A Dhakaani ruin turns out to be occupied by powerful aberrations . .
 . creatures far too powerful for the party to overcome alone. A 
Dhakaani force arrives on the scene, and together they could overcome 
the aberrations. Are they willing to share their loot, giving the 
Dhakaani the artifacts for which they have come?</li>
<li>The party comes upon a battle between Dhakaani goblins and Valenar 
elves. Do they try to avoid it, or do they pick a side? There's no 
telling who's in the right, and either force could become a powerful 
enemy.</li>
<li>The party walks into an inn -- and discovers a troop of Dhakaani 
soldiers in the common room. Are the gobinoids here for a sinister 
reason, or just looking for a hot meal and shelter from the rain? Can 
they pass the night without triggering an incident?</li>
<li>A disguised Dhakaani dirge singer has worked her way into an 
academic institution and is using their resources to help her recover 
treasures of the empire. She could oppose the party, or she could employ
 them.</li>
<li>After dealing with a group of adventurers and coming to respect 
their prowess, a Dhakaani clan could ask the adventurers to help them 
initiate diplomatic relations with one of the Five Nations or 
dragonmarked houses.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>The Soldiers of Dhakaan</b></p>
<p align="left">The composition of a Dhakaani unit varies based on the 
nature of the mission. Seven different characters are provided below, 
providing the basic tools for creating different units. A covert action 
team includes snipers and scouts led by a dirge singer, whereas a shock 
troop relies on bladebreakers, troopers, and an evoker.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dirge Singer</b></p>
<p align="left">The dirge singers are the spiritual leaders of the 
goblinoids, and they are also trained to serve as spies and diplomats. 
Dirge singers are almost always female.</p>
