<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">Eberron draws on pulp adventure for inspiration. In pulp
 tales, the heroes are remarkable people with skills and abilities that 
set them apart from the common populace. Eberron attempts to replicate 
this flavor. In Eberron, an 18th-level character is the stuff of 
legends. If player characters reach this level of power, they will be 
among the greatest heroes in the world. There have been heroes with such
 power in the past, but most have fallen to the passage of time or 
passed away in the long war. The player characters have the potential to
 be the heroes of this age, and should the threat of Xoriat return or 
the Dreaming Dark finally make its move, the party may be the force that
 kings look to for aid. </p>
<p align="left">Action points separate player characters from the 
masses. Aside from player characters, only the greatest villains and 
most important NPCs possess action points. Looking to a novel or movie, 
fortune often seems to favor the main characters, and this is the 
purpose of action points: to allow the party to shine even when facing 
opponents of equivalent power. </p>
<p align="left">Player characters are also distinguished by their PC 
classes. Most nobles are aristocrats, not fighters and wizards. The 
typical soldier uses warrior levels, and a common priest is an expert or
 adept, not a cleric. The PC classes are more versatile and powerful 
than NPC classes: a wizard is far superior to a magewright, and a cleric
 outstrips an adept both in battle and in the ability to use divine 
magic. As a result, even a low-level character with a PC class is a 
remarkable individual. This does not mean that the characters are the 
only fighters and wizards in the world. </p>
<p align="left">Just because the bulk of the population uses NPC classes
 doesn't mean that a DM has to use NPC classes for all of the people who
 challenge or oppose the party. Elite forces such as the warforged 
troops produced in the Last War, the artificers of House Cannith, or the
 assassins of House Thuranni can use PC classes, and there certainly are
 clerics in the Church of the Silver Flame in addition to experts and 
adepts. These people are remarkable individuals in their own right, and 
even at low levels they command respect from those around them. In a 
world where the average soldier is a 2nd-level warrior, a 5th-level 
fighter can be an important individual. This is the case in Eberron. </p>
<p align="left">The important thing is that NPCs do not follow the same 
rules as PCs. They do not acquire experience and advance in levels as 
player characters do. It's perfectly possible for a Brelish soldier to 
spend 20 years fighting in the wars and still be a 2nd or 3rd-level 
warrior. This is not about realism; if it was, you'd never see any 
20th-level characters, when you consider the superhuman level of skill 
this represents. This is about replicating the flavor of movies and 
novels in which heroes and villains stand far above the common folk. The
 supporting cast shouldn't overshadow the main characters. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Challenging Adventurers</b></p>
<p align="left">The relative scarcity of high-level NPCs is something 
that sets Eberron apart from many other published worlds. Some Dungeon 
Masters may feel that no forces can challenge a high-level party or keep
 them in check. In terms of enemies, foes exist that can pose a threat 
to even a 20th-level character. The Chamber can draw on the power of a 
nation of dragons. The Devourer of Dreams can pose a threat to an 
epic-level party. The Lords of Dust are millions of years old and can be
 as powerful as the DM cares to make them. Should a 50-HD daelkyr ever 
escape from the seals of Khyber, it will put a dent in most adventurers'
 days. As described in Chapter Nine of the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>,
 a DM should also consider recurring villains -- opponents who grow in 
power with the party. The Lord of Blades is only 12th-level now, so the 
party has a chance of fighting him and surviving. By the time the party 
members are 12th-level, he may be 15th; by the time they reach 20th 
level, he may be an epic foe. </p>
<p align="left">Beyond mere monsters, it's important to remember that 
there is more to challenge and threat than level numbers. The dragonmark
 houses, Church of the Silver Flame, and royal family have influence and
 resources. Just because the characters are 18th level doesn't mean they
 should make enemies of House Thuranni; a group of 12th-level assassins 
with specialized equipment, careful strategy, and the advantage of 
surprise can wipe out a higher level group. A 1st-level innkeeper can 
put deadly poison in a drink. High-level characters can accomplish 
amazing feats but they should never become complacent about their 
mortality or overconfident of their invulnerability. </p>
<p align="left">The flip side of this is that the PCs may find 
themselves in need of powerful allies. As noted above, level is not 
necessarily the key factor in determining the value of an ally. Even a 
20th-level character can benefit from the magic items provided by House 
Cannith. More importantly, the concept of gray alignment in Eberron 
means that villains themselves may occasionally become allies. The goal 
of restricting powerful, benevolent NPCs in Eberron is to prevent the 
party and the world from relying on NPCs to solve their problems for 
them. If the party needs to forge a temporary alliance with the 
Daughters of Sora Kell or the Lord of Blades, that's good drama. How far
 do you trust your ally, and what happens when you cross paths again? </p>
<p align="left"><b>Determining Class and Level</b></p>
<p align="left">As a result of all of the factors mentioned above, the 
overall demographics of class and level in the world are different from 
those presented in Chapter 5 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i> 
Characters who have more than twelve levels in a PC class are truly 
remarkable, even in the greatest cities of Khorvaire. As a result, when 
you are determining the highest-level character in an Eberron 
settlement, use the following tables in place of the ones in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>

<p align="left">1. In areas where these classes are common, level is 1d8
 + modifier, with a maximum value of 15. Druids are common in the Eldeen
 Reaches and the Shadow Marches. Rangers are typically found in the 
Eldeen Reaches, Shadow Marches, Talenta Plains, and Valenar. Barbarians 
can be found in the Demon Wastes, Darguun, Droaam, Eldeen Reaches, 
Shadow Marches, and Talenta Plains. </p>
<p align="left">2. In Thrane, level is 1d6 + modifier. The culture of 
Thrane is closely tied to the Church of the Silver Flame, and many of 
its citizens hear the call of the Silver Flame. </p>
<p align="left">3. In Aundair, level is 1d6 + modifier. In Karrnath, 
level is 1d4+modifier. Aundair is home to the Arcane Congress and 
celebrates mystics and artificers. The Twelve has its primary campus in 
Karrnath, and this results in a slightly higher level of mystical skill.
 </p>
<p align="left">4. In Karrnath, level is 1d8 + modifier. Karrnath has 
the strongest martial tradition of the Five Nations, and the Rekkenmark 
Academy produces the finest officers in the land. </p>
<p align="left">While high-level npcs and magic-users are rare in 
Eberron, the war and applied study of the arcane arts results in a wider
 spread of lower level characters. For this reason, in communities that 
are centers of commerce and craft, determine the highest-level NPC 
normally. The community will have twice as many characters of that class
 who are two levels below this level (11, 9, 7...), and twice as many 
1st-level characters as 2nd-level characters. The remainder of the 
population should be divided into 1st-level characters as follows: 90% 
commoners, 5% warriors, 3% experts, 1% magewrights, and 1% divided 
equally between adepts and aristocrats.</p>
