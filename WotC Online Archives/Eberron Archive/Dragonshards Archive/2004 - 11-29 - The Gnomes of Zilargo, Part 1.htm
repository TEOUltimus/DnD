<p align="left"><i>Dorilan Del Caroldan sipped his tal and studied the 
map on the table. "The first temple to the Mockery -- just imagine what 
secrets it must hold! But this is one ruin you'll never raid, Solas."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The half-orc roared with laughter. "I'm sure it will 
be dangerous, Dorilan, but we've faced far worse. I've spent more time 
in Xen'drik than I have in the Marches. Don't worry, my little friend --
 we'll keep you safe on the journey."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"It's not my safety that worries me, or the dangers 
of Xen'drik. Bursting into the Preceptor's estate, spilling blood in the
 light of day, beating that merchant for information -- that's not how 
things are done here."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Solas smiled and took a deep draught of his koreshk 
ale. Gnomes and their sense of propriety. The funny little man wouldn't 
last a day in Sharn. "Why not? I haven't seen a guardsman since I 
arrived. I've never seen a softer city." He looked at the door. "What's 
keeping Kyrna and Jaral? It's been nearly an hour."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"They're both dead," Dorilan said. But he wasn't Dorilan any more. </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Solas' hand flew to the hilt of his sword, but his 
muscles turned to ice before he could draw. He strained with all his 
might, but he could not move.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The gnome smiled, revealing the ivory wand she'd kept
 hidden beneath the table. She was younger than Dorilan, and dressed in 
darkweave and leather. "We believe the best guards are those that remain
 unseen." Silvered steel glittered as a dagger appeared in her hand.</i></p>
<p align="left">In a world where halflings ride dinosaurs and elf 
raiders seek glory in battle, few people see the gnomes as a threat. The
 little people are scholars and shipwrights, bards and bookbinders. 
Zilargo is filled with color and cheer, and the common image of the Zil 
gnome is that of a jolly craftsman always ready to lend a hand or an ear
 to those in need.</p>
<p align="left">But those who actually spend time among the gnomes know 
better. Zilargo is far deeper and darker than it appears, and the 
cheerful demeanor of the gnome is a carefully cultivated mask. A gnome 
may be no match for a half-orc barbarian in a fair fight -- but the 
gnomes of Zilargo seldom fight fair. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Jungle Rats</b></p>
<p align="left">The first mention of the gnomes can be found in the 
records of the Empire of Dhakaan. The Ghuurash Codex provides details 
about the first Dhakaani campaign against the "jungle rats" that 
infested the coast between the Howling Peaks and the Seawall Mountains. 
The gnomes of ten thousand years ago were feral and primitive -- a far 
cry from the civilization seen today. The hobgoblin sages believed that 
the gnomes were rodents that had been twisted by a conduit to Thelanis, 
or stunted, thin-blooded wererats that had lost the ability to shift 
forms. Proponents of this theory cited the small size of the gnomes, the
 strong instinctive bond within a family, the gnomish preference for 
burrows, and the racial ability to communicate with burrowing mammals. </p>
<p align="left">The savage gnomes were no match for the disciplined 
armies of Dhakaan, and the empire spread across the region. The gnomes 
were enslaved or forced deeper into the wilds. But conquest was far 
easier than occupation. While primitive, the gnomes were masters of 
their environment and had a particular gift with poisons; they could not
 fight Dhakaani armies, but they could poison wells and ambush supply 
trains. While they never presented a true threat to the empire, the 
gnomes remained a thorn in the side of the goblin invaders for many 
hundreds of years.</p>
<p align="left">The stalemate may have continued to this day, but 
destiny came in the form of the daelkyr. The extraplanar incursion 
crippled the empire, and the gnomes pounced on the weakened foe. In 
addition to physical sabotage and assassination, the gnomes began to 
employ the psychological techniques that would come to define their 
future nation. While the gnomes had yet to master the arts of wizardry, 
magic has always run through the blood of the gnomes. While many gnomes 
could summon a voice from the shadows, a few became full-fledged 
sorcerers, specializing in illusion. Combining magic with mundane arts 
of disguise and forgery, the gnomes took advantage of the shattered 
lines of communication in the empire to sow dissent among the commanders
 in the region, turning goblin against goblin and helping to ignite the 
civil wars that tore Dhakaan asunder. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The City-States Emerge</b></p>
<p align="left">As the goblins pulled back, the gnomes seized cities 
depopulated by the daelkyr, voraciously devouring the knowledge left 
behind and building new civilizations in the ruins of what had come 
before. Slowly families joined together to form the city-states of 
Trolanport, Korranberg, and Zolanberg. They fought goblins in the 
lowlands and kobolds in the mountains, and at times they fought each 
other; but the gnomes always preferred to fight with guile and 
deception, winning conflicts with wits instead of steel. The gnomes 
always numbered few and felt no need to conquer the land -- they 
contentedly held off enemies and maintained the territory they had 
claimed. </p>
<p align="left">But while the gnomes had no interest in expansion and 
colonization, they were always driven by a thirst for knowledge. At its 
deepest level, this is a survival instinct: The gnome knows that 
information is a weapon. The more he knows about an enemy, the more 
power he has -- and everyone is a potential enemy. Gnomes began to 
explore the continent, trade with the emerging cultures of Khorvaire, 
and learn all there was to know about land and water. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Birth of Zilargo</b></p>
<p align="left">The most critical moment in the history of the nation 
was the foundation of the Library of Korranberg. As the dragonmarks 
began to appear in Khorvaire, the loremaster Dorius Alyre Korran swore 
that he would build a fortress of knowledge -- an institute that would 
unlock every mystery of Eberron. This idea fired the imagination of 
gnomes across the region, and slowly this project became a national 
obsession. All three city-states donated resources to the Library, and 
soon the vaults began to fill with Dhakaani scrolls and the records of 
the first gnomes, which were carved on sticks of wood. The Library 
became a point of gnomish pride, and representatives of all of the 
city-states sat on the council of doyens.</p>
<p align="left">Then came the first great wars of the Current Age. 
Malleon the Reaver swept the southern coast, and Karrn the Conqueror 
began the work that Galifar would eventually complete. The gnomes found 
themselves faced with twin dilemmas. Could any of the city-states stand 
alone against humanity? And could they trust the other city-states not 
to betray them? Ultimately, the leaders found one answer to both 
problems: Expand the alliance they'd created with the council of doyens,
 and formally bind the three cities as one. After a few social 
experiments, the city councilors settled on the Triumvirate, and the 
unified nation was born. The gnomes called the new realm Zilargo, "The 
Home of the Wise." </p>
<p align="left">Working as one, the Zil gnomes held their own against 
human and goblin alike. The gnomes were equally adept at working with 
wood and words, and they had uncovered deep deposits of gems in the 
Seawall Mountains. The people of Trolanport and Korranberg gained fame 
as sailors and shipwrights, and gnome merchants, mediators, translators,
 and scribes spread across the Five Nations. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Trust</b></p>
<p align="left">The Zil alliance did not erase the feuds of the past. 
The Triumvirate could not eradicate the competitive nature of the gnomes
 -- and in truth, the cutthroat cunning of the gnomes was a point of 
national pride. But since these feuds began to threaten the interests of
 the new nation, it became clear that something had to be done. Once 
more the nation looked to the Library for inspiration, drawing on the 
example of the syndicate established to enforce honesty among students. 
Each Triumvir was authorized to select agents from her own city to 
create a corps of secret police -- an elite force who could be relied 
upon to place the interests of the nation above all else. Over time, all
 matters of law enforcement and national security were placed in the 
hands of the Trust. In many nations, gnomes serve as barristers and 
advocates, but in Zilargo there is no court of law: the Trust punishes 
the guilty, and its justice is swift and merciless. It is invisible and 
omniscient, staffed with spies, diviners, and assassins. Any Zil citizen
 could be an agent of the Trust. This calling comes above friendship and
 family. Even when you are alone, you might be watched by an invisible 
spy or scrying eyes. The Zil gnomes see this as a virtue; while they 
have little privacy, they also have the lowest crime rate of any nation 
in Khorvaire. The Trust is there when it is needed and invisible when it
 is not; even the members of the organization know only a handful of 
other members. In the eyes of the typical gnome, a loss of privacy is a 
small price to pay for security. </p>
<p align="left">The Trust acts only if something threatens society. The 
Zil gnomes constantly engage in blackmail and intrigue. This is a way of
 life in Zilargo, and the Trust acts only if the intrigues threaten the 
security of the nation or cause laws to be broken. For example, if a 
blackmailer forces jis victim to give him a lucrative shipping contract,
 no harm is done; the wealth still remains in the nation. On the other 
hand, if the blackmailer forces his victim to commit a murder, steal a 
rare book from the Library, or give secrets of elemental binding to 
House Cannith, the Trust intervenes quickly.</p>
<p align="left">This raises the following issue: If the Trust is so 
powerful, how can adventurers get away with anything in Zilargo? First, 
the Trust does not interfere unless Zil citizens are threatened. If a 
party of adventurers is chasing a Brelish fugitive -- well, provided 
that the adventurers don't disrupt the lives of Zil citizens in their 
hunt, they are free to do as they will. Of course, if the fugitive finds
 refuge in the home of a doyen, the adventurers need to find a way to 
extract the target without harming the household. Second, as noted 
earlier, intrigue isn't necessarily a crime. And most importantly, the 
Trust is not as omniscient as it wants people to believe. Anyone could 
be an agent of the Trust -- but not everyone is. Careless criminals and 
adventurers who think that they are above the law may be cut down to 
size by the Trust. But if the party acts carefully and cautiously by 
planning out its steps and taking advantage of disguise and abjuration 
magic, they can escape even the eyes of the Trust. Adventurers still can
 accomplish their goals in Zilargo -- they just need to use their brains
 instead of relying on sword and <i>fireball</i> to solve all their problems. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Galifar to the Present Day</b></p>
<p align="left">The Zil gnomes have never sought to build empires; 
instead, they have always insinuated themselves into the nations of 
others. In the Mror Holds, the gnomes do much of the actual work of the 
banking industry. Gnome merchants and sailors have a strong foothold in 
the Lhazaar Principalities, and they live and work in coastal 
communities across Khorvaire. In Breland, gnome crafters and engineers 
labor closely with the centers of industry. In Aundair, Zil sages hold 
key posts in the Arcane Congress and the University of Wynarn. The 
message stations of House Sivis are the key to international 
communication, and the Korranberg Chronicle is the most trusted source 
of news on the continent. Gnomes are everywhere, and they are almost 
always overlooked. But few realize the tight bonds of family -- and this
 is what gives the gnomes their power. </p>
