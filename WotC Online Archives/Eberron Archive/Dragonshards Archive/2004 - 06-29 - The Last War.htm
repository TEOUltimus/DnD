<p align="LEFT"><i>The stormship dropped from the night sky. The sleek 
longboat's black hull was almost invisible from the ground. A ring of 
elemental air held the ship aloft, only revealed when lightning flashed 
around the ring. A roll of thunder heralded the arrival of the warship, 
and a wave of arrows rained down upon the Cyran army. Sorcerous blasts 
of fire shattered the battlefield, killing friend and enemy alike. 
Within minutes, hundreds of soldiers were dead, and the tide of battle 
had been irrevocably altered. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The kingdom of Galifar ruled the continent of Khorvaire 
for almost 900 years. This peace was far from perfect. The western coast
 was a haven for all manner of beasts and monsters. Hostile goblins and 
kobolds lurked in the high mountains. Lhazaar lords sought profit on the
 seas. Occasionally a prince of Galifar would turn against tradition and
 fight the laws of succession. Such rebellions were rare, however, and 
the royal family always managed to put aside its differences in the face
 of these would-be usurpers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That was the situation in the kingdom for 894 years.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Why, at that point, did three of Jarot's heirs turn 
against centuries of tradition? Perhaps it was merely a matter of time. 
Since the founding of the Kingdom, the five nations had grown apart, 
with national pride and identity growing more pronounced with each 
century. Maybe it was an unfortunate conflict of strong personalities. 
Thalin of Thrane saw a chance to spread his faith; Kaius of Karrnath 
believed his sister lacked the strength to hold the throne; Wroann of 
Breland had long been an agent of change. All three may have acted on 
their own accord ... but perhaps they were the pawns of darker forces 
with a vested interest in the fall of Galifar. The Dreaming Dark has 
always used discord as a weapon. The Lords of Dust love chaos in all 
forms, and the Blood of Vol surely saw war as a way to increase its 
power in Karrnath. The full truth may never be known but the results are
 plain to see.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The conflict lasted far longer than the lives of the 
rulers that began it. Over the course of 102 years, the tides of war 
rose and fell. Alliances formed and collapsed. Nations were torn apart 
by civil strife and betrayal as Valenar, Darguun, and the Eldeen Reaches
 were born. Truces all were temporary, and never was there a time when 
all five nations were at peace; sooner or later the old conflicts would 
flare up again from the glowing coals of resentment. Only the utter 
destruction of Cyre brought all combatants to the table. In 996, the 
twelve nations of Khorvaire were recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold,
 and the Last War officially came to an end. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>War in the World</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Last War is a central element of the <b>Eberron</b><i></i>Campaign Setting<i>. </i>The
 war lasted more than a century and it has been over for less than two 
years. Future Dragonshard articles will focus on specific aspects of the
 conflict: famous battles, legendary heroes, and the techniques of 
warfare developed in the last days of Galifar. For now, here are a few 
brief ideas for tying the theme of the war into your Eberron campaign. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>War Torn Lands</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A century of war has taken its toll on Khorvaire. Any 
time a party travels near the borders of nations -- the old front lines 
-- the signs of conflict should be easy to see. Burnt-out villages are 
choked with ashes and weeds. Shattered bridges lay in heaps. Conductor 
stones that were torn out of the ground prevent use of the lightning 
rail. Magical scorch marks scar the earth. In larger communities, there 
may be signs of occupation or sorcerous attack. Bands of refugees 
seeking to rebuild their lives clog the roads or barely survive in 
squalid camps. Think about ways to drive this point home. Instead of a 
cheerful inn, the party may come upon a charred shell of a tavern, home 
to a ragged band of peasants who have turned to banditry to survive. 
Such brigands are no match for the adventurers, but is there any victory
 to be had from fighting them? </p>
<p align="LEFT">The largest monument to the war is the Mournland, which 
is now one vast dungeon. Its ruins are recent rather than ancient but it
 is still filled with the treasures of a nation, guarded by strange 
monsters and terrible magic. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Psychological Scars</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The psychological effects of the war are more pervasive 
than the physical damage and can be felt across the continent. A general
 aura of pessimism grips the population. Beyond the horror of the war, 
the Mournland casts a pall across the psyche of Khorvaire. No one knows 
what caused the terrible destruction or even whether it could strike 
again. Some Khyber cults and druid sects believe the Mournland is the 
first sign of a coming apocalypse. This fear is coupled with suspicion 
and anger. King Kaius's signature on the Treaty of Thronehold means 
nothing to the former Karrn soldier whose family was slaughtered during a
 Thrane offensive. The people of Thrane hate Karrnath with a passion. 
Aundair has never forgiven the Eldeen Reaches. No one trusts the 
Valenar. A former soldier who advertises his allegiance may receive 
Hostile or Unfriendly reactions in enemy nations but there may be 
smaller touches as well. Perhaps the innkeeper lost his only daughter in
 the battle of Keldan Ridge, and he wants the Karrnish fighter in the 
party to remember her name. Revenge and greed can motivate many 
adventures, as the party investigates the murder of a former general or 
searches for weapon caches hidden on the border of the Mournland. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Conspiracies</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The destruction of Galifar created an immense power 
vacuum across Khorvaire. Some seek to seize this power, while others 
long for a sense of security that no longer flows from the crown. As a 
result, the influence of cults and conspiracies has grown tremendously. 
Even a seemingly simple village may harbor a cult of the Dragon Below or
 a cell of the Emerald Claw, while a town may contain a half-dozen 
competing factions. The campaign setting book describes a number of 
influential organizations but these are merely the beginning. Others 
could form around religious beliefs, military service, or shared blood. 
Royal courts are full of political intrigue. These organizations are 
spread much wider than people expect; everyone is looking for something 
to hold onto, and even the smallest thorp may be home to a secret 
society. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Personal Experience </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When creating a party, players should think about how 
the war affected their characters. Did they fight; if so, who for? Did 
they lose family and friends? Shared military experience can be a strong
 basis for an adventuring party, especially if the PCs fought for the 
nation of Cyre, which no longer exists. If you follow this path, you 
might consider running your first adventure as a "flashback" to the war.
 Playing out a particularly interesting or disturbing military mission 
can clearly establish the effect of the war on the world and set up 
allies or enemies that can appear in future adventures. This also allows
 PCs to enter the post-war world with a little experience under their 
belts.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Mother of Invention</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The warforged, the airship, undead troops, and the 
eternal wand were all developed as weapons of war, and these are only 
the beginning. Future articles will explore magical warfare in more 
detail; until then, enlarge upon your own ideas for weapons or spells 
that were developed for battle. What was House Cannith working on in its
 hidden think tanks in the Mournland? What terrible secrets are waiting 
to be discovered? </p>
<p align="LEFT">These are just a few examples of the impact of the war. 
As you develop adventures or character backgrounds, take a moment to 
think about how the war can be woven into your story! </p>
