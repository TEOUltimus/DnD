<p align="left"><b>National Character</b></p>
<p align="left">The Valenar are a martial culture. Members of a warband 
are always searching for glory. To the Valenar, war is an art and a 
game. The heroes of Xen'drik relied on guerilla tactics in which stealth
 and skill were more important than raw strength. When fighting a weak 
foe, the Valenar may engage in straightforward battle to eliminate the 
enemy quickly before moving on to more challenging enemies. When dealing
 with a challenging opponent, however, the elves take their time, 
stalking, weakening the enemy, and enjoying the game. This is true on 
all levels, including society, which is why wars among the elves can 
last centuries. With their long lifespans, the elves do not see history 
in the same way as humans, and they rarely feel a sense of urgency. </p>
<p align="left">The predatory nature of the Valenar is reflected in all 
aspects of life. Whether a Valenar elf is engaged in a philosophical 
debate, bargaining with a merchant, or searching for an ancient 
treasure, the elf always views the situation from the standpoint of 
hunter and prey. </p>
<p align="left">Valenar are organized into warclans and warbands. These 
are military units that also incorporate strong emotional bonds. A 
Valenar puts his patron ancestor above all things, followed by members 
of his warband, and only then by members of his blood family. </p>
<p align="left">Valenar typically wear loose, silk clothing and light 
armor decorated with elaborate engraving and embroidery. One unusual 
tradition is the use of red or brown patterns mimicking blood spatters 
or stains so that the gore of battle will blend with the elf's clothing.
 A common accoutrement is the <i>zaelta </i>-- "spirit mask." This veil 
is practical in the harsh environment of the Blade Desert, but it also 
helps the wearer submerge his identity within that of his ancestor. A 
Valenar warrior usually wears the sigil of his ancestor on his helmet or
 as a brooch; thus, those looking at the elf see his ancestor, not the 
mortal warrior.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Valenar Religion: The Past in the Present</b></p>
<p align="left">Valenar elves revere their ancestors. Whereas the Aereni
 preserve their ancestors beyond death and rely on their advice, the 
Valenar (indeed, all Tairnadal elves) seek to recreate the glorious 
deeds of their martial ancestors, thus allowing the ancestors' spirits 
to live again in the present age. </p>
<p align="left">When an elf is born, the Keepers of the Past read the 
signs to determine the patron ancestor that will guide the elf through 
life. It is the duty of the child to honor and emulate this particular 
ancestor, though he should also strive to bring glory to his entire 
family. Many elves can share the same patron ancestor. This leads to 
competition among the elves as each strives to be the perfect embodiment
 of the common patron. </p>
<p align="left">The relationship between the Tairnadal and the Undying 
Court varies from elf to elf. The Undying Court played a vital role in 
the battle against the dragons, and the Tairnadal respect these powerful
 and ancient elves. This attitude is common among the older warriors who
 fought side by side with the Aereni. Some younger elves see the Aereni 
as stagnant and cowardly and claim that the councilors of the Undying 
Court are not true heroes. </p>
<p align="left">Keepers of the Past can be clerics or bards. A Valenar bard following this religion may take <i>spirit steed</i>
 as a 4th-level spell. A cleric of the Keepers of the Past can choose 
between the Destruction, Protection, and War domains, substituting <i>spirit steed </i>(4th) and <i>heroes' blade</i>
 (9th) for the corresponding spells on the War domain list. The Spirits 
of the Past are neutral, and the favored weapon of the Keepers is the 
double scimitar. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Valenar in Battle</b></p>
<p align="left">The Valenar are peerless warriors. Sword for sword, they
 have no equals in Eberron. Their low population is the greatest factor 
holding them in check. This skill is represented by the use of PC 
classes and high character levels. Most veteran Valenar soldiers are 
rangers of 4th to 6th level. With this level of skill, even a band of 
eight to twelve elves can pose a significant threat. </p>
<p align="left">Valenar soldiers prefer light armor and rely on speed 
and skill as opposed to pure force. The Valenar are renowned for their 
cavalry; most soldiers possess a deep bond with their mounts. Common 
feats include Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mounted Combat, and all of the 
feats that build on these foundations. </p>
<p align="left">While they are best known for their cavalry, the Valenar
 take great pride in skill with the scimitar and double scimitar -- so 
much so that all Valenar receive their racial Weapon Proficiency bonus 
in scimitar rather than longsword. Foremost among their swordsmen is an 
order of blade specialists known as the <i>Jaeldira</i>, "blade dancers." These are monks who often advance using the dervish prestige class presented in <i>The Complete Warrior</i>.
 Jaeldira monks may take Double Steel Strike as their bonus feat at 2nd 
or 6th level, applying this feat to the double scimitar instead of the 
double-bladed sword. </p>
<p align="left">Magic also plays an important role among the armies of 
the Valenar. The ancient elves took the secrets of magic from their 
giant masters, and many of the heroes of old were wizards. Most Valenar 
warbands include at least one evoker or conjurer. Valenar of other 
classes often take a level or two of wizard. Many Valenar rangers prefer
 <i>mage armor </i>to leather or steel, and <i>mount</i> is an 
invaluable aid to a cavalry master whose steed falls in battle (this 
spell is seen as calling on the spirit of a Valenar warhorse, even 
though the abilities of the shadowy steed are far more limited). Most 
Valenar wizards have birds as familiars because these creatures are so 
useful for scouting fields of battle. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Questions to Ask </b></p>
<p align="left">A Valenar elf's personality is strongly influenced by 
his patron ancestor. The Valenar strive to emulate their ancestors in 
all ways. When constructing a Valenar character or NPC, take some time 
to describe the patron ancestor. What was he known for? Was he a 
legendary archer or a swordsman? A poet? A traitor? What was his 
greatest battle? How did he die? </p>
<p align="left">Another important question is why the elf is away from 
Valenar and his warband. If you start at 1st level, you are less skilled
 than the typical Valenar ranger. Here are a few options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li> In the past, young Tairnadal would spend decades sparring against 
others of their age. At 1st level you are a novice warrior, but you 
believe you will gain glory and skill more quickly in the world than in 
the fortresses of Aerenal and Valenar. Your family may support your 
choice or you may be rebelling against tradition. <br><br></li>
<li>Your ancestor was a paragon of honor and virtue, and you cannot 
support High King Vadallia's betrayal of Cyre. You seek to bring glory 
to your ancestor, but you turned your back on the nation. <br><br></li>
<li>Your patron ancestor was a pioneer in the Khorvaire expedition, 
renowned for making contact with members of other races. By joining a 
group of adventurers and exploring the unknown, you are reenacting the 
life of your ancestor. </li>
</ul>
