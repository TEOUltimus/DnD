<p align="left">Druids are found across Khorvaire, and the Siyal Marrain
 of the Valenar are quite different from the Gatekeepers of the Shadow 
Marches. The <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> and <i>Player's Guide to Eberron</i>
 focus on the druids of the western coast of Khorvaire. This article 
examines one of the druidic traditions of the east: the halflings of the
 Talenta Plains.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mask Weavers</b></p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="290"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>Talenta Spirit Masks</b></p>
<p align="left">The spirit mask serves as the divine focus for a druid 
who follows the mask weaver tradition. Druids have also learned to bind 
the favor of a particular spirit to a mask, creating wondrous items 
holding the power of <i>bull's strength</i>, <i>fox's cunning</i>, <i>cat's grace</i>,
 and similar spells. The halflings believe that once a rider and his 
mount are dead, the mask must be burnt to release the spirits within 
into Dolurrh. This does not prevent <i>raise dead</i> or any other spell
 that interacts with departed spirits from working on the owner or the 
mask. Whether there is any truth to the beliefs of the halflings is up 
to the DM!</p>
<p align="left">The tales of the soul-eaters are stories told to 
frighten children. However, if a DM wants to explore these legends, 
adventurers could encounter halflings whose masks allow them to cast <i>death knell</i>... or worse still, masks that add the <i>Keeper's fang</i> quality to any weapon used by the wearer.</p>
<p align="left">While the spirit mask may be as much a symbol as 
anything else, these masks are vitally important to the Talenta 
halflings. A halfling adventurer could be charged to recover the lost 
mask of a great hero, so that it can be destroyed in accord with the 
proper rituals.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Where the Valenar warrior seeks to channel the spirit of
 his ancestor through his heroic deeds, the Talenta druid believes that 
her ancestors are all around her, affecting every aspect of life. The 
druid serves as the intermediary between the worlds and guides her 
people on the journey of life. The halflings believe that the dead are 
drawn to Dolurrh and must fight their way free to return to the world. A
 halfling possesses two tools to help him in this battle: his mount and 
his mask. The spirit of a halfling's mount joins with him in Dolurrh, 
and it is their combined strength that gives them the chance to return. 
His mask holds his spirit or the spirit of his mount -- whichever dies 
first -- preserving it so that they may be together in the afterlife; 
many say that when a rider bonds with a new mount, the spirit of the old
 will flow from his mask to join with that of the living beast. Some 
whisper of rituals a warrior can use to trap the spirits of his fallen 
enemies in his mask and use their strength as his own, though most say 
that such dark magic will corrupt the caster and transform him into a 
demon after death.</p>
<p align="left">One of the first duties of the druid is to help her 
people craft their spirit masks, and as a result druids are often called
 mask weavers. The druid serves many other crucial roles in her 
community. She heals the sick and injured. She helps to find and train 
clawfeet, fastieths, and the other beasts that the nomadic tribes rely 
on. She serves as a diplomat for the tribe, both when dealing with other
 tribes and with the spirits of nature. And she acts as a storyteller 
and record keeper, preserving the oral traditions of her people and 
passing them down to the next generation.</p>
<p align="left">While mask weavers recognize one another as peers, their
 first loyalty is to the other members of their tribe. Even when a mask 
weaver dies without training a successor, a tribe will not turn to an 
outsider in search of aid; instead they will simply wait, confident that
 the spirits themselves will speak to one of the children of the tribe 
and teach him the secrets of the mask weavers. While it is rare for a 
mask weaver to leave his tribe, there are two ways it can happen. 
Occasionally a young druid is called forth by the spirits and ordered to
 go out into the world, in search of a hidden destiny that is far more 
important than his service to the tribe. The morbid alternative is when a
 tribe is destroyed. Even during feuds, enemy warriors will try to avoid
 harming a mask weaver, since many say this will bring bad luck to the 
slayer. As a result, a mask weaver may find herself the last surviving 
member of her tribe. Most of these orphans leave the Plains, searching 
for a new life in the wider world. Either of these could serve as 
background for an adventurer. Diplomacy, Heal, and Perform (oratory) are
 critical skills for a mask weaver. Talenta druids may take the 
Greensinger Initiate feat, though they have no ties to the Eldeen sect 
or to Thelanis; it is simply a case of parallel development based on the
 values and traditions of the mask weavers.</p>
<p align="left">The druidic path is not the only way to show reverence 
for the spirits. Talenta clerics usually worship the sovereign Balinor, 
although halflings claim that Balinor was once a great hunter of the 
Talenta Plains. If a DM is using <i>Complete Divine</i>, the spirit shaman class is also suitable for Talenta priests.</p>
