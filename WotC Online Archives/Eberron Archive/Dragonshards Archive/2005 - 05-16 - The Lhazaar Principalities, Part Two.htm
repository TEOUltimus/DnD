<p align="left">Over two dozen princes exist in the Lhazaar 
Principalities. Some of the smaller islands -- such as Krag and 
Lastpoint -- are under the dominion of a single prince. The coastline 
and the larger islands are home to multiple princes, each claiming a 
port stronghold and the surrounding hamlets and thorps.</p>
<p align="left">This article examines a few of the more powerful or 
unusual principalities. The Knowledge listing provides the skill check 
required for a player character to know of the principality. It is 
important to understand that leadership among the principalities is not 
based simply on level: While a player character could potentially rise 
to the rank of prince, she would need to win the support of the people 
of the principality and build a fleet of her own, not simply defeat the 
current prince in battle. There is more to leadership than level!</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Seadragons</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Leader: </b>High Prince Rygar ir'Wynarn (LN male human ranger 9)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Seat:</b> Regalport, Greentarn</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge: </b>Geography (DC 20); local (DC 10); nobility and royalty (DC 15)</p>
<p align="left">With a fleet of twenty ships and a host of loyal 
warriors, the Seadragons are the strongest force in the Lhazaar 
Principalities. Under the leadership of High Prince Rygar, they have 
been a stabilizing force in the region. While Rygar has sailed as both 
privateer and pirate, in recent years he has made the city of Regalport a
 center for trade in the eastern sea. The high prince fought for 
recognition at Thronehold, and the Seadragons have been staunch allies 
of Q'barra -- helping this fledging nation while gaining access to 
Q'barran dragonshards.</p>
<p align="left">Rygar is remarkably clever and charismatic, with skills 
in diplomacy as well as the blade. He has earned a reputation as a man 
of his word, though he will not give his word carelessly. However, he is
 a Lhazaarite, and he respects the traditions of his people -- including
 piracy. Merchants who sail the Bitter Sea can pay for the protection of
 the Seadragons, and Rygar will strike at any ship that dares to raid 
near Regalport. But he feels no obligation to hunt down Lhazaarites who 
engage in piracy. </p>
<p align="left">One of Rygar's earliest acts as prince was to grant 
House Thuranni land on Greentarn. This alliance between House Thuranni 
and the Seadragons is one more weapon in the high prince's arsenal. Some
 say that Rygar wanted to bring House Thuranni to the Principalities to 
guard against of the Gray Tide principality; if anyone can counter 
changeling schemes, it's the house of shadow. </p>
<p align="left">Characters of all races and classes can be found among 
the Seadragons, making this a good background choice for PCs from the 
Lhazaar Principalities. Seadragons lean toward lawful or neutral 
alignments.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Cloudreavers</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Leader: </b>Prince Mika Rockface (CE female dwarf barbarian 6)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Seat:</b> Port Krez, Krag </p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge: </b>Geography (DC 25); local (DC 10)</p>
<p align="left">The Cloudreaver principality is based on the island of 
Krag. It is a blend of dwarves, orcs, and half-orcs -- traditionally 
enemies in the Mror Holds, these races have found common cause on the 
seas. The Cloudreavers have always been wild and unpredictable, prone to
 violent feuds and acts of savagery. They never gave up the practice of 
piracy, even during the height of Galifar's power; this has cost them 
dearly over the generations, and their power has waxed and waned with 
the luck of the sea. Currently the Cloudreavers have a fleet of six 
vessels, but these ships are remarkably swift; the Cloudreavers possess a
 number of <i>windsails</i>, which are magic items imbued with a permanent <i>wind's favor</i>.
 These treasures allow the Cloudreavers to range far from their homeland
 and to match the speed of elemental galleons. Typically, the 
Cloudreavers prey on the southeastern shores of Galifar, striking at 
Q'barran, Aereni, Darguun, and Zil vessels and villages; occasionally 
Cloudreaver captains even head into Brelish shipping lanes, attacking 
ships en route to Stormreach or Trolanport. The Cloudreavers prefer to 
strike at night, taking full advantage of the darkvision possessed by 
most of their sailors.</p>
<p align="left">Prince Mika Rockface is an aggressive and boisterous 
woman with remarkable strength and an uncanny ability to inspire terror 
in her enemies. She believes that she has been blessed by the Devourer 
and that she gains strength for every vessel she sends to the bottom of 
the ocean. Whether this is true or simply a delusion remains to be seen!</p>
<p align="left">The Cloudreavers are mostly chaotic dwarves, orcs, and 
half-orcs, with a few humans. Most Cloudreavers are warriors or 
barbarians, with a few fighters and rangers. Many Cloudreavers worship 
the Devourer, and some develop druidic abilities as a result of this 
devotion. The principality takes its name from this practice; tales 
speak of Cloudreaver pirates calling lightning from the sky to shatter 
enemy sails and ships. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Gray Tide</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Leader:</b> Prince Kel (Unknown)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Seat:</b> Lastpoint </p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge: </b>Geography (DC 25); local (DC 15)</p>
<p align="left">Changelings have always been viewed with suspicion by 
most of the people of Khorvaire -- and occasionally that fear has boiled
 over into something worse. Thirteen hundred years ago, the lords of the
 nations now known as Karrnath, Cyre, and Thrane began a campaign of 
extermination against the changeling race. Many changelings fled to 
Breland or Aundair, hiding among humanity. But one among them was not 
satisfied with survival. This changeling was named Kel, and he had a 
vision of a changeling homeland: a realm on the edge of the world, where
 changelings could live away from the fearful scrutiny of humanity. He 
traveled the land, speaking to family after family, and slowly an exodus
 began -- a journey that ended on the island of Lastpoint. There, 
staring into the disturbing wall of the Gray Tide, Kel declared that 
they had found their home.</p>
<p align="left">No outsider knows the full size of the Gray Tide 
principality. Some estimates say that there are over fifty thousand 
changelings in the Lhazaar Principalities, though it is impossible to 
know for certain. Changelings have spread out across the islands, and 
many of the brothels and theaters in the Principalities are run by 
changelings. Lastpoint changelings also serve as guides, interpreters, 
and mediators, serving as hirelings on ships of other princes. Some 
Lhazaarites fear that the changelings have spread far deeper into 
Lhazaar society than anyone knows. But most are willing to see the 
changelings as brothers on the sea, and they are more accepted in this 
region than anywhere else in Khorvaire. </p>
<p align="left">The Gray Tide principality is ruled by Prince Kel, and 
it has been since its founding. Most outsiders believe that this is the 
work of one or more changelings -- a lineage that preserves Kel's image.
 Some say that Last Point is the seat of the secret society known as the
 Cabinet of Faces; if so, this is one more secret hidden on this island.
 </p>
<p align="left">The Gray Tide principality is thought to have four 
ships, and common belief holds that it does participate in piracy. 
However, a host of rumors has circulated about the principality. Some 
say that the changelings can enter the Gray Tide without danger, and 
that they have a fleet hidden within it. Other tales claim that the 
changelings have developed ships that can shift appearance, so that 
their acts of piracy are blamed on others. The truth of these tales is 
in the hands of the DM. </p>
<p align="left">This principality is inhabited almost entirely by 
changelings, most of whom are chaotic or neutral. Characters of any 
class can be found on Gray Tide ships, though experts, rogues, and bards
 are most common.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Bloodsails</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Leader: </b>Prince Shaen Tasil (LE female elf cleric 7 [Blood of Vol])</p>
<p align="left"><b>Seat:</b> Port Cairn, Farlnen </p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge: </b>Geography (DC 25); local (DC 15); religion (DC 30)</p>
<p align="left">When the Undying Court sought to destroy the Mark of 
Death, all elves carrying the blood of the line were slain. But the Line
 of Vol had many allies beyond its blood relatives. The Undying Court 
allowed these elves to surrender, but there was no place for them on 
Aerenal, and they left to find a new home on Khorvaire. Many of these 
refugees found their way to the island of Farlnen, making a new home in 
the long shadow of the Fingerbone Mountains. Today, many elves choose to
 remain in isolated communities deep in the Fingerbones, but others have
 embraced Lhazaar culture and the life of the sea. The largest of these 
is the Bloodsail principality, centered in Port Cairn (a town on the 
central southern coast of Farlnen). </p>
<p align="left">The elves brought extensive knowledge of magic, archery,
 and woodworking to the Principalities; Bloodsail ships are some of the 
finest in the Lhazaar fleets. While the elves are interested in all 
fields of arcane knowledge, necromancy is especially important to them; 
every Bloodsail captain has at least one level in wizard (necromancer) 
or cleric (Blood of Vol). Farlnen is a center for the worship of the 
Blood of Vol, and almost all of the Bloodsails follow this faith. During
 the war, the Bloodsails served as privateers for Karrnath. This changed
 when King Kaius III denounced the Order of the Emerald Claw, and today 
the Bloodsails often raid Karrnathi ships and villages. Recently, the 
Bloodsails have formed an alliance with the Diresharks of Point Verge. </p>
<p align="left">The Bloodsails are one of the most stable 
principalities, and Prince Shaen Tasil has ruled for over a century. 
Shaen is cool and calculating; she has no interest in holding the 
position of high prince, but she keeps a close eye on political 
struggles and has often served as a mediator. The previous leader was 
Prince Moren; according to legend, Moren was cursed for his dark 
practices and now sails the Bitter Sea in a ship of bones. </p>
<p align="left">The Bloodsails currently possess seven ships. Tales say 
that they dye their dark sails with the blood of their victims -- but 
this could be a story spread to inspire terror.</p>
<p align="left">The Bloodsails are largely lawful or evil elves, with a 
few humans, half-elves, and changelings spread throughout the populace. 
While most Bloodsail sailors are warriors, rogues, or swashbucklers, a 
significant number of clerics and wizards live in the principality.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Wind Whisperers</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Leader: </b>Prince Koulton Brightwind (CN male half-elf ranger 4/dragonmarked heir 4) </p>
<p align="left"><b>Seat:</b> Blackrock, Orthoss</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge: </b>Geography (DC 30); local (DC 20), nobility and royalty (DC 30)</p>
<p align="left">Not all of the Aereni refugees sought shelter in the 
shadow of the Fingerbones. Some fully embraced Lhazaar culture, mingling
 with humans and creating a significant population of half-elves. The 
island of Orthoss is a haven for the Khoravar, and half-elves from 
across Khorvaire have found their way to the town of Blackrock. Notably,
 the Lhazaar lifestyle has attracted a number of members of House Medani
 and House Lyrandar over the centuries -- young rebels seeking an escape
 from the smothering traditions of their houses. Their blood has been 
spread across the island, and it has been spread quite thin -- but 
occasionally a child of Orthoss develops a dragonmark. </p>
<p align="left">Those who develop the Mark of Storm generally find their
 way to the Wind Whisperers. Members of this small principality are as 
wild and unpredictable as the wind itself. They often help travelers in 
distress, but are known for raiding or otherwise interfering with 
Lyrandar vessels. </p>
<p align="left">The current prince of the Wind Whisperers is Koulton 
Brightwind. Born Koulton d'Lyrandar, this gifted heir earned his place 
with the whisperers by stealing an airship and bringing it to Orthoss. 
House Lyrandar has put a price on his head, but Prince Brightwind has 
made arrangements with House Thuranni, and so far his head remains 
attached to his shoulders. </p>
<p align="left">The Wind Whisperers have seven ships, including one 
airship and two elemental galleons. The remaining four ships are small 
and fast, and not as powerful as Bloodsail or Seadragon warships.</p>
<p align="left">The Wind Whisperers are primarily chaotic or neutral half-elves, but members of any race or class live in this principality.</p>
