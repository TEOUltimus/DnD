<p align="left">Few outsiders understand the inner workings of House 
Phiarlan and House Thuranni, and these houses of shadow would have it no
 other way. To the world at large the elves of Thuranni and Phiarlan are
 known as entertainers of the highest order. Those who know of the 
secret services these houses offer often assume that this work was 
adopted as a cover for espionage and intelligence, and that the house 
formed only after the Mark of Shadow appeared. Little could be further 
from the truth. The Mark of Shadow served as a rallying point, but the 
tradition of the houses stretches back long before the manifestation of 
the mark -- all the way to Xen'drik itself. </p>
<p align="left">The first and most important thing to know about House 
Phiarlan is that most of the people of Khorvaire have no idea that the 
house is engaged in espionage work. The role of entertainer is not 
simply a cover. It is a tradition that dates back tens of thousands of 
years, and for many members of the houses, it is the only trade that 
they follow. Certainly, rumors state that the elves are spies and 
assassins, but to most people this is an urban legend. Where would the 
virtuoso soprano find the time to be a spy? She's known across Khorvaire
 for her talents -- do you really think she sneaks out and kills people 
during the intermission? In a world of changelings, doppelgangers, and 
rakshasa, the common folk have many other things to worry about. And if 
you walk into a Phiarlan enclave and ask to hire a spy, the coordinator 
will advise you to hire a Tharashk inquisitive. Phiarlan does possess 
one of the finest intelligence networks in Khorvaire, rivaled only by 
the Trust of Zilargo, but these services are available only to 
guildmasters and nobles, which are forces Phiarlan recognizes as players
 in the great game of politics and power.</p>
<p align="left">So how do the twin paths of entertainment and espionage 
converge? Where did Phiarlan begin, and what role does it serve in the 
modern world? What caused the split between Phiarlan and Thuranni? To 
understand the present, let us begin in the past.</p>
<p align="left"><b>In the Beginning </b></p>
<p align="left">The houses of shadow can trace their roots back to the 
Elven Uprising, the ancient war between the giants of Xen'drik and the 
ancestors of the modern elves. Many assume that this was a conflict 
between two monolithic entities, but neither elves nor giants were 
unified forces. Many different giant nations existed, and there were 
dozens of sects of elves, ranging from former slaves to guerillas who 
had fought the giants for millennia. Over the course of the uprising, 
some elves served as liaisons between the many different tribes. These 
travelers saw their role in war as being more spiritual than physical: 
Their task was to uphold morale and maintain the alliances between the 
scattered soldiers. They called themselves <i>phiarlans</i>, or "spirit 
keepers." These phiarlans learned the traditions and customs of all 
elven sects, and a phiarlan bard could inspire warriors from any tribe. 
The phiarlans were not generals or military strategists, but their 
motivational work and the intelligence they carried from place to place 
was an invaluable part of the military effort. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Birth of Aerenal </b></p>
<p align="left">In the end, pride, dragonfire and twisted magic brought 
doom to Xen'drik. In the last days of the war, a visionary leader 
gathered elves from across the continent and arranged an exodus to 
search for a sanctuary across the water. Many of the phiarlans joined 
her cause, and their diplomatic skills and knowledge of the scattered 
tribes played a crucial role in the exodus. The journey was a long one, 
but the songs of the past and tales of glory helped soothe the fears of 
the travelers.</p>
<p align="left">Eventually the elves found a new home in Aerenal, and 
they slowly claimed the land as their own. But in the time before the 
Undying Court, Aerenal was a very different realm from the ordered 
nation seen today. Most of the elves remained isolated in tribal 
communities, which ultimately evolved into the modern elven bloodlines. 
The phiarlans continued to serve as liaisons, working to strengthen the 
bonds between the bloodlines. Phiarlans would travel from court to 
court, performing the traditional arts of fallen Xen'drik and sharing 
news from other parts of the land. They also made an effort to look 
below the surface -- to seek out rivalries and schemes that might 
threaten the peace and balance between the lines. Typically a mediator 
would seek to settle disputes openly, but sometimes a phiarlan would 
quietly pass information to the parties that needed to know. This aspect
 of the phiarlan was well known, but accepted and even respected; a 
phiarlan might spy on your court, but he would only use that information
 for the good of the growing nation. If you had nothing to hide, you had
 nothing to fear; conversely, anyone who refused hospitality to a 
phiarlan clearly had something to hide. The reputation of the phiarlans 
was their shield, and their remarkable skill with song, dance, and other
 arts was the coin with which they paid their hosts. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Rise of the Undying Court</b></p>
<p align="left">Death has always been an obsession of the Aereni. 
Millions of elves died in the fall of Xen'drik, and the elves swore that
 they would never lose their heroes again. But different lines followed 
different paths toward this goal. The Priests of Transition studied ways
 to preserve the spirit beyond the death of the body. The line of Vol 
dabbled in blood magic and dark arts. And the Tairnadal sought to become
 vessels for the fallen through perfection of the martial arts. </p>
<p align="left">In time, the Priests of Transition won the support of 
the majority of the Aereni. The path of the deathless relied on the 
veneration of life, while many saw the work of Vol as preying on the 
living to prolong the life of a few. Over the course of thousands of 
years, the Undying Court took form, and this served as an anchor that 
brought the lines together. The first conflict against the dragons 
cemented this unity. Following this first battle, the councilors of the 
Undying Court selected the first of the Sibling Kings, and modern 
Aerenal was formed. </p>
<p align="left">With the Undying Court in place, laws were established 
to govern the land, and what had previously been a friendly alliance now
 became a true nation. In this era, the phiarlans moved from being pure 
mediators and newsbearers to actual spies. Tensions rose as the nation 
coalesced, and not everyone supported the rule of the Sibling Kings; in 
particular, the line of Vol rejected the teachings of the Priests of 
Transition. The phiarlans continued to carry the ancient forms of art 
and entertainment from court to court. But now family lords and the 
Sibling Kings paid them to monitor enemies, searching for signs of 
dissidence, rebellion, or feuds. While they began to take gold for these
 services, the phiarlans still saw themselves as peacekeepers: They 
brought light to the shadows so justice could find its way. </p>
<p align="left">And then the dragonmarks appeared.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Fall of Vol</b></p>
<p align="left">The phiarlans had always been drawn from three different
 lines: Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi. The Mark of Shadow first appeared
 on a member of Elorrenthi, but these lines had long mixed their blood 
and members of Shol and Tialaen soon manifested the mark.</p>
<p align="left">Some say that the ascendant councilors of the Undying 
Court are among the only humanoids with the age or intellect required to
 study the draconic Prophecy. But living sages had made some study of 
the Prophecy in the wake of the dragon wars, and while the elves did not
 know the significance of the marks, they recognized them as playing a 
role in the schemes of the dragons. The elves first coined the phrase 
dragonmark, though few remember this. Fear followed the appearance of 
the marks. What was their purpose? What was the source of their power, 
and why had certain families been chosen? Given the long conflict 
between Aerenal and Argonnessen, anything tied to the draconic Prophecy 
was viewed with suspicion. This prejudice strengthened the bond between 
the three phiarlan lines, but it also pushed them away from the rest of 
the Aereni. The Sibling Kings quickly established their own security 
forces and relied on the Cairdal Blades and the Deathguard where they 
might have once used the phiarlans. </p>
<p align="left">The rivalry between the Priests of the Transition and 
the followers of Vol had been building for thousands of years, and the 
appearance of the Mark of Death three thousand years ago simply made 
matters worse. The situation finally came to a head when the Cairdal 
Blades uncovered an alliance between Vol and a cabal of dragons. The 
extent and purpose of this alliance was never revealed to the public, 
but the Undying Court launched a full scale assault on the line of Vol. 
The Sibling Kings declared that the Blood of Vol was to be completely 
destroyed, since even a drop could destroy all living things. It was the
 first war between elves -- and the first time that dragons and elves 
sided against a common foe, since the forces of Argonnessen joined the 
Undying Court to destroy Vol and its allies. </p>
<p align="left">This conflict shook Aerenal to its core, but in the end 
the line of Vol was exterminated. Some whispered that a single heir of 
the house, Erandis d'Vol, escaped the destruction -- but Lord Haensu of 
the Cairdal Blades claimed to have faced Erandis in battle and 
vanquished her. Still, the line of Vol had many followers who had no 
actual blood ties to the family, and these elves were given the choice 
of abandoning their vile traditions or leaving Aerenal. Many left, 
though not just the former followers of Vol numbered among them. 
Numerous Aereni believed that the shedding of elven blood had forever 
tainted the land, and those who bore the Mark of Shadow feared that they
 would be the next to suffer the fate of Vol. A handful remained, 
believing that it was their duty to the kingdom; these elves found 
themselves largely absorbed into other lines, and this mingling of blood
 causes the Mark of Shadows to occasionally appear in Aerenal. But most 
of the elves of Tialaen, Shol, and Elorrenthi fled to Khorvaire so that 
they could start anew. To mark their departure from elven society, they 
formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Phiarlan in the Present Day</b></p>
<p align="left">The elves had been uprooted from their home and their 
culture, and they intended to gain a secure position in this new land as
 quickly as possible. That meant amassing power. The people of Khorvaire
 had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents 
of the elves, and this sparked a renaissance in culture across the land.
 Elven entertainers were welcomed into every village and city, and in 
the process they gained knowledge and contacts. The elves of Phiarlan 
had spent over ten thousand years serving as the eyes of the Undying 
Court, and they put these skills to good use. And once they had sunk 
their roots deep into the land, the barons of the house contacted the 
other lords of the land, offering their services in exchange for gold or
 favors in days to come. </p>
<p align="left">Today, Phiarlan's coffers are filled with gold and 
platinum. Its performers entertain viewers on the greatest stages and in
 the humblest taverns, and its eyes are watching even where no elf can 
be seen. Few commoners realize the true reach of the house, but kings 
and queens respect its power, and it is a force even the mightiest 
adventurers should treat with respect.</p>
