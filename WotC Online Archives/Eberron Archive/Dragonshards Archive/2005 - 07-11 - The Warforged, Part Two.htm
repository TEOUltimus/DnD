<p align="left"><b>Warforged Childhood</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2007-11%20-%20The%20Warforged,%20Part%20Two_files/eb20050711a_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="189" width="265">A
 warforged emerges from the creation forge with only the most basic 
knowledge of the world, drawn from a template bound into the creation 
forge. It can speak the Common tongue, and it recognizes the humans of 
House Cannith as its creators and instructors. It is not born with skill
 at arms, or the power of magic. Yet somehow, over the course of a few 
short months, the trainers of House Cannith transform this newborn into 
an elite soldier capable of facing the undead strength of a Karrnathi 
zombie or the skill of a Thrane knight.</p>
<p align="left">House Cannith is the House of Making, not a military 
powerhouse. How did it mold the warforged to produce fighters, wizards, 
and other classes so rarely found among the general populace?</p>
<p align="left">The warforged is born a blank slate, but it possesses a 
voracious appetite for knowledge. Just as the mind of a human child is 
more flexible than that of an adult, in its first few months a warforged
 possesses an astonishing ability to learn and adapt. A warforged may 
begin with no knowledge of the battlefield. But many Cannith instructors
 claim that the knowledge seems to be hidden beneath the surface, just 
waiting to be unlocked -- that within a few months of training, a 
warforged soldier may outstrip the skills of his teacher. The warforged 
must be shown the path to walk, but after taking its first steps, a 
warforged often picks up speed, learning skills in mere months that a 
human might take years to master.</p>
<p align="left">After the first few months, however, the warforged's 
thought patterns crystallize, fixing on the path it has chosen. At this 
point, it is essentially an adult: It possesses the skills it needs to 
perform its chosen task, and while it can still learn new skills, this 
takes just as much time as it would for a human or an elf.</p>
<p align="left">A side effect of this focused study is that warforged 
tend to frame their lives around their military specialties. A warforged
 may have the same skills as a human warrior, but that human had a life 
beyond war. He has memories of his parents, his lovers, his children, of
 songs and stories, of tears and joy. The warforged soldier knows only 
war -- and now he must learn of the world that exists beyond the 
battlefield. More information about this soldier mindset can be found in
 <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/177450000">Races of Eberron</a>. </i></p>
<p align="left">In the last years of the war, some forgeholds sought to 
take maximum advantage of this early "savant stage." Since constructs 
have no need of sleep, the warforged could train for 24 hours each day. 
Some facilities would use rotating shifts of human instructors; others 
turned to warforged instructors, using tireless constructs to train 
constructs. Most of these programs produced exceptionally skilled 
warforged soldiers. However, some artificers claim that the products of 
this path were typically more independent and less reliable. Some say 
that the Lord of Blades was one of these warforged instructors -- and 
that his most loyal followers are the students he trained at the Cannith
 forgehold.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cults and Religions</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Races of Eberron</i> presents many of the most common
 beliefs of religious warforged. But warforged follow as many different 
paths as humans do, so take a look at more options to consider when 
creating player characters or NPCs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Silver Flame: </b>The Church of the Silver Flame 
has much to offer the warforged. The Flame itself is not an 
anthropomorphic deity, and it is not supposed to have created or shaped 
human civilization. Instead, it can guide a warrior and empower her in 
the battle against evil. Warforged that fear death may take comfort in 
the concept of immortality through the Flame, since noble souls are said
 to bond with the Flame after death. Most importantly, the church is a 
militant order, and for the warforged soldier who feels lost without a 
war, the Church of the Silver Flame offers an anchor and a chance to 
take part in a battle that will never end -- the struggle against evil 
itself.</p>
<p align="left">Many in the church still feel that the warforged do not 
have souls and are not the equals of the true servants of the Flame. 
However, as more warforged join the church, cardinals, ministers, and 
templars alike are being impressed with the dedication and good works 
performed by these tireless servants of the light.</p>
<p align="left">One of the most prominent warforged followers of the 
Silver Flame is a warforged soldier named Brightspear (LG male 
personality warforged fighter 1/paladin 8). Built to serve Aundair in 
the Last War, Brightspear was rendered inert in a battle on the Eldeen 
border, but he was restored by a group of Silver Flame priests. 
Brightspear claimed to have heard the voice of the Flame while inert, 
calling him to serve, and he subsequently proved able to channel the 
power of the Flame to perform miracles. Over the past decade, he has 
battled undead, aberrations, and a host of other monsters; he is best 
known for uncovering a rakshasa assassin and killing the fiend in 
Aurala's court. Brightspear uses the warforged paladin substitution 
levels outlined in <i>Races of Eberron</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Traveler: </b>Many know that Onatar is the 
sovereign lord of the forge. Far fewer know of the role of the shifty 
Traveler and why this trickster is a deity of artifice. Some say Onatar 
guides the hands of the smith, but the Traveler is the source of new 
ideas -- of inspiration that can lead an artificer to entirely new paths
 of knowledge. The danger is that one never knows where these paths will
 lead: What seems like a good idea may have disastrous consequences down
 the road. While Onatar is the official patron of House Cannith, many in
 the house make secret sacrifices to the Traveler. Today a growing cult 
among the warforged has members who believe that this mysterious deity 
is the true creator of the warforged. This belief has even spread among 
the followers of the Lord of Blades, some of whom say that the Lord of 
Blades is a vessel for a spark of the Traveler itself. Warforged 
followers of the Traveler believe that the Cannith artificers were 
tricked into creating the warforged and were guided by the hand of the 
Traveler. Their true purpose is yet to be revealed, but humanity may 
learn to beware the gifts of the Traveler.</p>
<p align="left">The most powerful warforged advocate of the Traveler is 
not a cleric, but rather an artificer. Wheel (CN female personality 
warforged artificer 10) is an ally of the Lord of Blades, and she has 
used her talents to create many of his weapons. She believes that the 
Lord of Blades is a tool of the Traveler, but her first loyalty is to 
her god, and she may prove to be an unexpected ally of the party when 
things are at their worst. She uses the warforged artificer substitution
 levels from <i>Races of Eberron.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Blood of Vol:</b> While some warforged turn to 
the Blood of Vol in hopes of escaping death, others join the cult for 
exactly the opposite reason. Many of the followers of the Blood believe 
that life is a battle against the curse of death. For mortals, the only 
escape is undeath. But warforged are already immune to hunger, disease, 
age, exhaustion, and many of the other plagues of mortality. As a 
result, some Blood evangelists have convinced warforged soldiers that 
they are the perfect champions of the church -- that they will fight at 
the side of the vampire lords in the final battle against death itself. 
These warforged soldiers are often haughty and arrogant in their 
newfound sense of immortality.</p>
<p align="left">One of most dangerous servants of Vol calls himself 
Thirst (NE male personality warforged scout 5/assassin 3). While not a 
vampire, Thirst takes pleasure in spilling the blood of the enemies of 
Vol.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Warforged Senses </b></p>
<p align="left">The warforged possess the same five senses that human 
beings do: sight, smell, hearing, touch, and even taste. They do not 
perceive the world in precisely the same way as humans do, and many of 
these senses are fairly dull in comparison to those of creatures of 
flesh and blood. But a warforged can smell smoke in the air and can 
gauge the extent of an injury by the pain that it feels. Many warforged 
value the magical component known as the <i>tracker mask</i> because it 
expands their sense of smell, allowing them to experience the world in a
 new way. But a warforged can still smell strong odors without the mask.
 </p>
<p align="left">The warforged sense of taste is one of the mysteries of 
the race. It has little value to a soldier and creature that has no need
 of food. In fact, this is not something that was designed by the 
artificers of House Cannith. Warforged are not automatons, and not every
 aspect of the warforged is the result of human planning: They are 
creatures of magic that defy natural law. A warforged is a creature of 
stone and wood, yet it can feel love and hate. Is it any stranger that 
it should be able to smell and taste?</p>
