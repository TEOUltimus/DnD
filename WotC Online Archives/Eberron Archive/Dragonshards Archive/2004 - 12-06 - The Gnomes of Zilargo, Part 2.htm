<p align="left"><i>"Five words can defeat a thousand swords."</i></p>
<p align="left">-- Zil proverb</p>
<p align="left"><b>National Character</b></p>
<p align="left">Some have compared the Zil gnomes to social rodents. The
 gnomes are happiest in groups. They are energetic and highly 
industrious, and they prefer to avoid conflict with larger creatures. 
But like rats, gnomes are survivors. Stealth, deception, and pure 
tenacity are the tools of the gnome -- and when cornered, a gnome can be
 a surprisingly dangerous foe. </p>
<p align="left">The streets of Zilargo are bright and cheerful. The 
gnomes are helpful, attentive, and usually willing to lend an ear to the
 troubles of a traveler and a hand to those in need. Sometimes this is 
just what it seems. But the Zil gnomes are schooled in deception from 
childhood, and, all too often, their good cheer and friendly demeanor is
 an illusion. The Zil character has a paranoid streak, and the helpful 
nature of the Zil gnomes is rarely altruistic. While the gnomes are 
curious by nature, that curiosity is often fueled by the desire to gain 
leverage over every possible enemy. If you tell a gnome your problems, 
he may or may not help you. If he does, you owe him a favor. If he 
doesn't, he has learned about your weaknesses -- and in the eyes of the 
Zil, all information has value.</p>
<p align="left">It would be an exaggeration to say that every Zil gnome 
is a ruthless schemer. While cunning and cautious, the Zil are people 
like any other. While some are cold-blooded opportunists, others do 
enjoy helping others. But even a goodhearted gnome may rely on 
manipulation and deception to accomplish his goals.</p>
<p align="left">While energetic and cheerful, the gnomes are not 
childish or foolish. They are masterful merchants and negotiators, and 
they are adept at setting others at ease and weaving words into a 
pleasing tapestry. The people of Zilargo see language as an art, so Zil 
gnomes are typically well-spoken and sophisticated. Even a gnome farmer 
or miner has training in conversation and debate. The typical gnome is 
not a clown or a source of comic relief -- unless it suits her purposes 
to have others see her that way. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Games of Wit and Wisdom</b></p>
<p align="left">The Zil gnomes love games of strategy, but their 
favorite pastime is intrigue. The seemingly dull farmer could be 
involved in a dozen plots. Often these plots are tied to a local 
community: feuds to shift the balance of power between families, 
attempts to influence local romances, or economic schemes. Two gnomes 
may engage in a shadow war to acquire a certain rare book, not because 
either truly cares about the book, but as a game -- a test of cunning 
and wit. But beyond these innocent pastimes, the waiter at the bar could
 be working for the Trust, the Aurum, the Korranberg Chronicle, or any 
number of other cabals with international goals. </p>
<p align="left">Beyond his personal schemes, every Zil gnome has a bond 
to his family and his clan, and each has its own economic and political 
goals. Business contracts, mining rights, government positions, 
influence within a trade guild -- in Zilargo, all of these things are 
determined by cunning and manipulation. As noted in Part One, the Trust 
intervenes only if the security of the land is threatened or if actual 
laws are broken. If the Lorridans and the Lyrrimans are feuding to see 
who will get the rights to Blackhowl Mine, the Trust doesn't care -- as 
long as no one is killed and the resources of the mine ultimately 
benefit gnomes. If the Lorridans started murdering the Lyrrimans, or the
 Lyrrimans made arrangements to sell the mine to House Cannith . . . 
that's when the Trust may get involved. </p>
<p align="left">Family loyalty is immensely important in Zilargo. In a 
society that thrives on deception, the gnomes find it extremely 
important to have someone they can trust without reservation, and for 
the Zil this is the bond of blood. While families may fight one another 
for position within a clan, betrayal of a direct family member is almost
 unheard of and would call for bitter and vicious vengeance. Likewise, 
favors and debts are a serious matter in the Land of the Wise. A web of 
secrets, favors, and debts binds this nation together, and a gnome may 
be called on at any time to repay a personal favor or a debt owed by her
 family. Failure to comply with a reasonable request threatens the 
entire system and can have grave consequences. Of course, this is a 
two-way street; a gnome PC is expected to repay her debts, but she can 
also call in favors from the people she helps during her adventures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Role of the Bard</b></p>
<p align="left">The Zil use the standard gnome statistics presented in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 Their unusual culture is reflected by the fact that many gnomes who 
would be commoners in other nations instead possess a single level of 
expert, with training in Sense Motive, Bluff, Diplomacy, and a number of
 languages in addition to the Craft or Profession skills they use to 
earn a living. </p>
<p align="left">A surprising number of gnomes rise above the level of 
expert to become bards. While gnomish entertainers are celebrated across
 Khorvaire, not all bards are entertainers, and many Zil bards do not 
have any ranks of Perform. But even without the powers of bardic music, 
the class reflects many things common to Zil culture. The skill 
selection is highly appropriate for the Zil, who focus on social, 
knowledge, and language skills. Bardic knowledge represents the gnomish 
fascination with knowledge in all forms. And the magic of the bard is an
 extension of the innate racial gifts of the gnome -- magic that lies 
latent in the blood of the race. Thus Zil chroniclers, politicians, 
mediators, and barristers are just as likely to have bard levels as 
actual entertainers.</p>
<p align="left">When it comes to entertainment, the Zil gnomes love 
story and song above mere music, and skilled performers illustrate their
 tales with phantasmal forces. Musically, small hand drums and woodwinds
 are the most common instruments. But the trademark of the Zil master 
musician is the <i>Thurimbar rod</i> -- a wondrous item that enhances a gnome's innate talent for <i>ghost sound</i>, allowing him to produce any sound he can imagine. Due to the high price of the <i>Thurimbar rod </i>(2,800 gp), these instruments are usually seen only in the hands of the finest bards or as treasured heirlooms.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Zil Style and Customs</b></p>
<p align="left">Zil spellweavers bind illusion into cloth, and the 
finest glamerweave comes from this land. Some tailors specialize in 
hypnotic abstract patterns while others weave clear images into their 
outfits: an evening gown might hold a breathtaking rendition of a sunset
 over the Seawall Mountains. Magical or no, most Zil gnomes prefer 
bright colors and loose, flowing designs. Hats are also popular, and a 
typical Zil street has gnomes wearing a plethora of different styles of 
headgear. Jewelry bearing both precious and semiprecious stones 
accentuates clothing; a gnome who cannot afford gold and gemstones sees 
no shame in wearing finely crafted ornaments of copper and glass. </p>
<p align="left">Zil architecture is as beautiful as the clothing of the 
gnomes. Multiple types of wood and stone blend together to form pleasing
 patterns. Even the smallest communities are lit with <i>continual flame, </i>and,
 in large cities and metropolises, bound elementals provide heat, light,
 and other amenities. The gnomes go to great lengths to make their homes
 accessible to foreigners; in cities and towns every building have doors
 and furniture sized for Medium creatures as well as Small ones, and 
even in the villages at least one building is designed to accommodate 
Medium visitors. Zil houses are often filled with trappings from foreign
 lands -- Aereni woodwork, Sarlonan tapestries, and exotic plants from 
Xen'drik or Q'barra. Traditionally a guest brings a small gift to repay a
 host for his hospitality, and this often becomes a form of competition.
 A wealthy gnome might send a party of adventurers to Xen'drik to 
recover a piece of art from the Age of Giants, purely because she wants 
to present it at a party. </p>
<p align="left">Gnomes use <i>prestidigitation</i> to maintain their 
personal appearance and to keep property clean; as a result, the streets
 are unnaturally bright, colors remain remarkably vivid, and the gnomes 
themselves have impeccable hygiene. Even in filthy foreign cities, a 
gnome takes pains to maintain her appearance, and a dirty gnome probably
 isn't from Zilargo. Likewise, ragged adventurers may be barred from 
certain Zil establishments and events unless they are properly groomed 
and attired. Gnomes also have a keen sense of smell, and scent plays a 
significant role in Zil fashion; men and women alike make use of 
perfumes and oils, many so subtle that humans can't even smell them. A 
social "language of scent" allows a gnome to indicate her current status
 -- seeking companionship, conversation, solitude, help, and so on. A 
gnome can recognize the intent of a scent by making a DC 10 Wisdom check
 and a DC 15 Knowledge (local) check. Other creatures with enhanced 
senses -- such as a shifter with the Wildhunt ability -- can identify 
these scents, but unless raised among gnomes they cannot deduce the 
social meaning of the smell. </p>
<p align="left">The gnomish sense of smell and talent for <i>prestidigitation </i>are
 also reflected in Zil cuisine. The Zil gnomes make use of a wide 
variety of subtle spices, including certain flavors that can be produced
 only through <i>prestidigitation</i>. One of the most common beverages 
in the land is maleko, which is chilled water infused with faint traces 
of flavor; visitors are often baffled by the gnome who passes up a 
tankard of ale to savor a glass of water.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Artifice, Alchemy, and the Arcane </b></p>
<p align="left">Magic runs through the blood of the gnomes -- a faint 
gift of illusion that some attribute to the distant touch of Thelanis. 
Many gnomes develop this talent without formal training. Levels of bard 
or sorcerer reflect this, and the gnomes typically focus their studying 
on enchantment, illusion, and conjuration spells. The insatiable 
curiosity of the gnomes has led to the pursuit of artifice and arcane 
magic. Zil artificers are justly famed, but House Cannith possesses the 
most gifted artificers in Khorvaire, and Arcanix is still the greatest 
seat of wizardry. But Zil gnomes are unsurpassed in two fields: alchemy 
and elemental binding. Some say that the Zil wrested the secrets of 
elemental binding from the ruins of Xen'drik, and they jealously guard 
this secret. No rule in the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i> book stops a
 PC of any race from taking the Bind Elemental feat. However, a DM may 
require a PC to acquire this feat in Zilargo or Xen'drik. In addition, 
the Zil gnomes consider this knowledge to be a national resource. An 
adventurer producing an occasional suit of elemental-bound armor is left
 alone, but if a PC starts producing airships and thus threatening the 
Zil monopoly on the art, he may be targeted by agents of the Trust.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Questions to Ask </b></p>
<p align="left">When you play a Zil gnome PC or NPC, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your relationship with your family? </li>
<li>Are you involved in any long-term intrigues? Who are your enemies and rivals?</li>
<li>What form does your curiosity take? Are you trying to gain 
influence? Arcane knowledge? Or do you simply want to visit new lands 
and meet interesting people?</li>
<li>Conceal your feelings from all but your closest friends. Feign 
whatever emotions suit the needs of the moment -- but only your most 
trusted allies should ever see your true face. </li>
<li>A Zil gnome almost always seeks to avoid direct physical combat. Is 
there a way to resolve a conflict without resorting to violence? If not,
 how can you maximize your advantages against the enemy? To the Zilfolk,
 a fair fight is a fool's game. </li>
<li>Language is an art. Never use one word when you could use two, provided those two are clever and witty. </li>
</ul>
