<p align="left">The <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000"><i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i></a>
 adds a number of options for druids, including mechanical benefits and a
 nation driven largely by druidic beliefs. However, these options raise 
additional questions. How far are the sects spread across the land? Do 
you have to be a member of a sect to be a druid? What happens to your 
dragonmark when you use wild shape? This three-part article will examine
 a host of issues tied to the druids of Eberron and take a closer look 
at druids beyond the Eldeen Reaches, from the blood guardians of the 
Valenar to the savage druids of the Demon Wastes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Role of the Sect</b></p>
<p align="left">The <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i> presents five 
druidic sects: the Wardens of the Wood, the Ashbound, the Children of 
Winter, the Gatekeepers, and the Greensingers. Each sect has unique 
goals, traditions, and beliefs. The Gatekeepers seek to protect the 
natural world from unnatural horrors, while the Children of Winter 
believe that nature will soon scour the world with plague and disaster. 
Each group has one or more feats that provide a druid with unique 
abilities associated with the teachings of his sect. You do not have to 
be a member of a sect to be a druid, and you don't have to take the 
associated feat to be a member of a sect. Being a member of a sect is a 
matter of belief and backstory, and as long as you and your Dungeon 
Master can come to an agreement on your story, you can have a tie to any
 sect... or none at all. You may believe that Eberron sees through the 
eyes of all living things, and the thunder is her voice. That Eberron 
slumbers, and when she wakes she will shatter every city. That 
civilization is part of Eberron's plan for the world, and just as the 
rabbit digs a burrow, a human is expected to build a city. Like any 
cleric, you should have a central pillar for your faith, but like a 
cleric, you don't have to adhere to one of the major religions.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="290"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>The Shadows of the Forest</b></p>
<p align="left">The King's Forest fills southeastern Breland. This rain 
forest spans hundreds of square miles and provides a home to a wide 
array of fantastic creatures. However, over the course of centuries, 
logging and industry have diminished it. The Knight Rangers of Breland 
patrol the borders and do their best to counter the actions of poachers 
and brigands, but the forest is vast and the Brelish rangers rarely 
venture into its depths. The deep forest has other defenders: druids and
 rangers who slip through the shadows, as stealthy as the displacer 
beasts that accompany them. These are the Shadows of the Forest.</p>
<p align="left">The Shadows of the Forest act to control the dangerous 
beasts, doing what they can to keep such monsters from venturing near 
the fringes of the forest and the trade roads. But the Shadows have also
 fought loggers and laid snares for legitimate hunters, including the 
royal party of the King's Hunt. Many of the Knight Rangers are grateful 
for the aid of the Shadows, but by the laws of the land, these druids 
are trespassers and poachers: A knight is duty-bound to bring Shadows to
 justice.</p>
<p align="left">Five bands of Shadows are in the King's Forest, each 
with approximately twenty-five members. They remain in constant motion, 
using Survival to forage for food and shelter. The Shadows of the Forest
 claim to hear the whispers of the wild, a call that guides them in 
their travels. Occasionally this pulls a Shadow away from his band; it 
may even draw him out of the King's Forest and onto the path of the 
adventurer.</p>
<p align="left">Most of the Shadows are humans and shifters, though one 
of the five bands is comprised entirely of gnomes. The Shadows have a 
close affinity with displacer beasts, represented by the Beast Totem, 
Beast Shape, and Beast Companion feats. They are masters of stealth, and
 many Shadow druids take the Guerilla Warrior feat (from <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/860900000"><i>Heroes of Battle</i></a>)
 or a level or two in the ranger class to enhance their skill with Hide 
and Move Silently. The techniques of the sect are similar to those of 
the Wardens of the Wood, and at the DM's discretion a Shadow character 
may take the Warden Initiate feat.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> presents 
feats that are not tied to a specific druid sect: Beast Totem, Beast 
Shape, and Beast Companion. In addition, a DM can always choose to 
provide access to an appropriate feat to members of a new sect he has 
created. For example, the King's Forest of Breland is home to a small 
band of druids and rangers known as the Shadows of the Forest, which is 
described in more detail below. While the Shadows have no ties to the 
Wardens of the Wood, their goals and methods are very similar and the DM
 may allow a Shadow druid to take the Warden Initiate feat... with a 
clear understanding between DM and player that this doesn't represent a 
tie to the Wardens, and that the Wardens will not recognize the druid or
 her order if she travels to the Reaches. A sect feat represents a 
particular style of druidic training and should be reserved for members 
of an organized group. However, that group can certainly have developed 
in parallel to the Eldeen sects, instead of being part of them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Druidic Language</b></p>
<p align="left">All druids have one thing in common: knowledge of the 
Druidic language, which druids receive as a bonus language upon taking 
their first level of the class. What does this mean? Why would an Eldeen
 Greensinger and a Talenta mask-weaver speak the same language, not to 
mention the hermit who has never encountered another druid? If the 
Gatekeepers were trained by a dragon, why do they know Druidic instead 
of Draconic?</p>
<p align="left">Druidic is not a normal language. You don't learn 
Druidic in the same way that you'd study Sylvan, and even if you know 
it, you can't teach it to a friend any more than you could teach her to 
cast <i>detect snares and pits</i>. As you master your first level of 
druid, you learn many magical mysteries. You learn how to speak with 
animals, how to calm them, and how to hide from them. You unlock the 
secrets of fire. You learn to mend flesh with a touch, and how to ask 
the plants to entangle and trap your enemies. These are just a few of 
your secrets, and the Druidic tongue is another. Many druids believe 
that it is the first language -- the primal language of Eberron herself.
 Some claim to have found Druidic inscriptions carved in the sides of 
mountains or written in the drifting clouds; the DM will have to decide 
if these tales are truth or fancy.</p>
<p align="left">Since only druids can learn Druidic, speaking this 
language is a way to identify yourself to other druids you may 
encounter. If you're about to be boiled alive by kobolds, an appeal to 
the kobold druid spoken in Druidic could save your life. However, not 
all druids are allies. A peaceful hermit may despise the violent actions
 of the Ashbound or the doom-driven work of the Children of Winter. 
Speaking in Druidic will establish a basic bond, but if you just killed 
the opposing druid's totem companion, it's not going to get you off the 
hook.</p>
