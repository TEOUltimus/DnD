<p align="left">Sharn is a vertical city, and over the course of 
centuries the people of Sharn have developed a variety of sporting 
events that take advantage of the unique architecture of their home. 
Windchasers dart around the towers following elaborate racing paths, 
while skyblades joust far above the ground. But one event overshadows 
the rest: the Race of Eight Winds, which is held on the 23rd day of 
Lharvion. This event draws spectators and gamblers from across 
Khorvaire. Part race, part aerial battle, this stunning spectacle has 
shaped the culture of the Dura Ward -- and this event can present many 
opportunities for adventurers.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>History and Structure</b></p>
<p align="left">According to legend, King Galifar II was fascinated by 
the use of aerial scouts and cavalry. Some say that he used Sharn as a 
testing ground to judge the merits of different flying beasts, granting 
land and gold to exceptional cavaliers. Over the centuries, this evolved
 into an exotic race involving different sorts of magical and fantastic 
beasts. For purposes of the race, Dura is divided into eight regions, 
each of which is represented by a different creature. To this day, the 
name of the creature is often used as a slang term for the inhabitant of
 one of these areas; when someone talks about "that treacherous owl," 
he's probably referring to a resident of Rattlestone or the Bazaar. </p>
<p align="left">The race itself is a test of speed and skill, 
challenging the reflexes and combat skills of both beast and rider. From
 the starting point in Hareth's Folly, the race takes competitors on an 
intricate course that weaves in and around the towers of Sharn -- and 
since contact is allowed between riders and beasts, the racers can 
always try to win by eliminating the competition.</p>
<p align="left">The race is older than most of Sharn, which explains why
 much of Upper Dura is not represented; it literally didn't exist when 
the tradition began. Hareth's Folly and Hostelhome have always been 
neutral ground where people gather to watch the race.</p>
<p align="left">While not everyone takes an interest, many of the 
inhabitants of Lower and Middle Dura are avid followers of the Race of 
Eight Winds. It brings people of all races and professions together, and
 those directly involved with the race are the heroes of their 
districts. This includes the riders and handlers, along with the Wind 
Guard -- a committee appointed to manage the interests of the region. 
While this is a great honor, it carries considerable responsibility: 
there is far more to the Race of Eight Winds than just skill in the air.
 The Wind Guard has to raise funds to acquire, maintain, and train the 
exotic beasts used in the competition. Usually local merchants donate a 
share of their profits to support the race, but it is up to the Wind 
Guard to make up for any shortfall. In addition to finances, the members
 of the Wind Guard engage in a never-ending series of schemes and 
negotiations on behalf of their region. Alliances and networks of favors
 stretch back for centuries, making the race as much a match of politics
 as of speed. The owl is one of the slowest creatures in the race, but 
the Bazaar has a powerful economic position and often uses bribery and 
graft to get ahead. The griffon rarely tries to win, instead using its 
physical power as a bargaining chip throughout the period between races;
 even if the griffon can't win, it can usually take another creature out
 of the race. Of course, it may be that the hawk owes a favor to the 
owl, and repays that favor by asking the griffon to cripple the pegasus 
-- and this is a fairly simple example.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Rules</b></p>
<p align="left">Traditionally, each region enters a single beast and 
rider in the race. However, if a region makes a 250 gp donation (which 
goes into a general treasury to offset the cost of the land grant), it 
may enter a second contestant. While this is rarely done, it is the 
primary way for outsiders -- such as player characters -- to enter the 
race. A would-be contestant would need to negotiate with the Wind Guard 
and find a region that willingly lets her participate under their 
banner. </p>
<p align="left">The race itself is a dangerous event. Full contact is 
allowed between beasts and riders, and beasts can use any natural 
weapons that they possess. Riders cannot use spells, psionic 
disciplines, dragonmarks, magic devices, or alchemical items, and anyone
 who breaks these rules is immediately disqualified and exposed to mob 
violence. A rider is allowed to carry a sporting crossbow and a dozen 
quarrels; this is similar to a light crossbow, but it has an 80-foot 
range increment and deals only 1d3/1d4 damage. This allows for 
entertaining conflict while preventing swift kills.</p>
<p align="left">The victorious rider receives a 500 gp purse and a small
 parcel of land -- while the Wind Guard of the winning region lays claim
 to the <i>Rod of Eight Winds</i>. This mysterious item is a major 
artifact recovered from the depths of the city long ago; some say it is 
linked to Syrania and projects the effects of a manifest zone within a 
short distance. However, few of the people of Dura have any interest in 
the rod's history or powers. What matters is its current role as the 
symbol of Dura's pride -- and each district is desperate to claim it.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Using the Race of Eight Winds</b></p>
<p align="left">The Race of Eight Winds is a massive sporting event that
 draws interest from across the continent. It could impact an adventure 
in a number of ways.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Local Color: </b>Each creature is associated with a 
particular region within Dura. As the race draws near, visitors see 
banners displayed across Dura, and people dress in the colors of their 
beast. Passing adventurers may be invited to a meal and called upon to 
toast the health of the local beast, or an adventurer who coincidentally
 happens to be wearing the wrong colors may spark a brawl. This can 
provide a way to introduce new NPC enemies or allies, or simply add 
depth to the description of a scene.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Participation: </b>A skilled rider may want to enter 
the race himself. The character needs to gain the sponsorship of one of 
the regions; he is more likely to gain the acceptance of one of the 
slower beasts than the hippogriff or pegasus, who win all the time and 
want to preserve the fame of their local riders. Winning the race makes 
the character a landowner, which could be interesting; it also makes him
 a local celebrity in Sharn, which could open the door to many other 
opportunities. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Troubleshooting:</b> Someone has poisoned the local 
griffons, and the Wind Guard of Precarious have only three weeks to find
 a replacement: Can the party find a wild griffon in time? The race is 
in one week, but the <i>Rod of Eight Winds</i> has been stolen; can the 
adventurers recover the lost artifact? The PCs are asked to provide 
security for the pegasus -- which seems like an easy task until Daask 
gets involved. A friend of the party loses a fortune gambling on the 
race, and the Boromar Clan is threatening her life: Can the PCs help? If
 the characters are unscrupulous enough, they may even be hired to 
cripple racing beasts to skew the odds!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Beasts</b></p>
<p align="left">Looking to add a little color to Dura? Here are the 
eight beasts traditionally used in the race, along with the districts 
they represent. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Eagle: </b>The districts of Broken Arch and 
Stormhold support the giant eagle, whose colors are brown and gold. 
Stormholders are especially passionate about the race, even though the 
eagle rarely wins. Many Stormholders take pride in being fierce and 
noble like the eagle, and they rarely participate in the politics and 
intrigue that often affect the final outcome of the race. They are 
especially dismissive of the other birds of Middle Dura; the hawk is a 
lesser eagle, while the owl is treacherous and far too clever.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Gargoyle: </b>Fallen and Malleon's Gate were 
originally represented by the dire bat. As immigrants from Droaam came 
to Sharn, most settled in the Cogs or Malleon's Gate. Twelve years ago, 
the region of the bat made an unprecedented change and shifted their 
regional beast to the gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. 
Currently, the region is represented by Carralag (N male gargoyle rogue 
4), a remarkably clever gargoyle with the Manifest Flight feat.</p>
<p align="left">The people of Malleon's Gate are fiercely dedicated to 
the event. The violence appeals to the Darguuls, while the city goblins 
love the chance to compete against the elitist folk of the upper levels.
 While the gargoyle has yet to win the race, it has had greater success 
than the bat, and this has brought increased support for Daask and the 
Droaamites within the district. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Glidewing:</b> This flying dinosaur represents 
the districts of Gate of Gold and the Stores, and its colors are gray 
and green. The glidewing is extremely popular among the halflings of 
Sharn, and some say that the Boromar Clan is the financial force behind 
the Glidewing Wind Guard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Griffon: </b>This powerful beast represents 
Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. During the 
race, red ribbons are usually tied to the forelegs of the griffon, 
giving the impression of streams of blood coming from its claws. The 
people of Precarious are fanatically (and often violently) devoted to 
the race, although many don't care if they win or lose; as long as the 
griffon brings down one of the other beasts, they consider it to be a 
victory.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Hawk:</b> Tumbledown and Underlook are 
represented by the dire hawk, whose colors are light brown and dark 
brown. The hawk rarely wins, but Underlook makes considerable profits 
off the tourist trade and most Tumbledowners are devoted followers of 
their underdog champion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Hippogriff: </b>Daggerwatch and Overlook are 
represented by the hippogriff, whose colors are white and gold. The 
Goldwings (the aerial division of the Sharn Watch) are based in 
Daggerwatch, and a Goldwing officer typically represents the district in
 the race. The hippogriff has one of the best records in the race, 
rivaled only by the pegasus.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Owl:</b> The giant owl is the beast of 
Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. While it 
is one of the slowest creatures in the race, the owl is famous for 
manipulating the outcome of the race with intrigue and diplomacy. While 
many of the inhabitants of Dura speak dismissively of "two-faced owls," 
the merchants, con artists, and pickpockets of the region take pride in 
their mascot's cunning, and a strong streak of carefree pragmatism runs 
through these districts. A few former racing owls are now merchants 
themselves, which can lead to unusual encounters in the Bazaar. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Pegasus:</b> Highwater was the last district to 
join the Race of Eight Winds. Thanks to House Vadalis, Highwater is 
represented by the pegasus, whose colors are white and silver. The 
pegasus is the swiftest creature in the race, and it has brought 
Highwater to victory time and again. The people of Highwater are proud 
folk and are always willing to discuss the ways in which a pegasus is 
superior to the other beasts. However, success has its price. The other 
districts often team up to bring down the pegasus at the start of the 
race. And outside of the race, many of the inhabitants of the lower 
wards despise the people of Highwater; thieves and bullies will go out 
of their way to target a snooty pegasus supporter. </p>
