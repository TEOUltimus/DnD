<p align="left"><b>Ministers and Priests</b></p>
<p align="left">The Church of the Silver Flame is highly structured. 
Someone who seeks to enter the order of friars or ministers first serves
 as an apprentice within his local community, learning the basic 
teachings of the Flame. When he receives the blessing of the local 
minister, he can enter one of the seminaries of the Flame. </p>
<p align="left">Most initiates progress as experts, learning mundane 
skills that will help them serve their communities. Knowledge 
(religion), Heal, and Diplomacy are vital skills, and Knowledge (the 
planes) and Sense Motive are encouraged. In addition, most initiates 
have ranks in Craft or Profession. Various challenges test an initiate's
 potential to channel divine magic; those who possess this talent are 
called to the Great Seminary of Flamekeep, where the wisest adepts of 
the church teach them. The cardinals occasionally visit the Great 
Seminary, and on rare occasions the Keeper herself will speak to the 
young adepts. A character's backstory could incorporate this, giving a 
PC a pre-existing connection with a high-ranking patron in the church. 
But is the cardinal in question faithful to the Flame, or is she a 
corrupt schemer?</p>
<p align="left">At the end of this training, a minister usually possesses two NPC levels (expert, adept, or one of each) or one level of cleric.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Paladins and Templars</b></p>
<p align="left">The templars learn their trade in one of the fortress 
monasteries scattered across Khorvaire. While monasteries exist 
throughout Thrane, Breland, and Aundair, the three largest fortresses 
are located in Thrane: the massive monastery of Kloijnir, which watches 
over Flamekeep; Tira's Watch, on the southeastern border of Thrane and 
Breland; and Morningcrest to the west. Templars live an austere life, 
and they dedicate themselves to combat training and religious studies. 
The majority of templars become warriors, while the most gifted become 
fighters or monks. A cleric typically travels to a fortress monastery 
after completing spiritual training in Flamekeep, and here he learns the
 use of weapons and armor. These monasteries also serve as garrisons, 
and most templars remain at the monastery even after completing their 
training. Occasionally a templar accompanies a friar or serves as a 
pilgrim; this calling is a matter between the templar and the abbot. </p>
<p align="left">Paladins are a special case. You cannot train to be a 
paladin: it is a spiritual calling. Many paladins learn basic skills 
outside of the Church, since the Voice of the Flame guides them. 
Ministers and friars who discover a potential paladin send her to a 
monastery for full training, though some paladins have risen to 
significant levels before officially joining the church. A paladin must 
undergo tests at Flamekeep before she can act as an official 
representative of the Church. Some then take up residence at the templar
 monasteries, but many serve as pilgrims or serve in secular 
organizations, such as the Knights of Thrane or the King's Citadel; 
their calling draws them out to the world, and they find monastic life 
stifling.</p>
<p align="left">Eberron is a place where alignments are blurred, but the
 paladin is held to a higher standard. A paladin embodies good, and the 
Flame itself calls her to serve as a champion of the light. A paladin's 
powers are the result of her faith, her purity, and her destiny. If a 
player wants to be a corrupt warrior with divine powers or a holy 
warrior who doubts her cause, she shouldn't be a paladin -- she should 
play a fighter/cleric, or something similar. With that said, the moral 
ambiguity of Eberron makes life challenging for the paladin who expects 
everything to be black and white. In a crowd of ten commoners, odds are 
good that three will be evil. But that doesn't mean they are monsters or
 even killers -- each is just a greedy, selfish person who willingly 
watches others suffer. The sword is no answer here; the paladin is 
charged to protect these people. Oratory, virtue, and inspiration are 
the weapons of the paladin -- though intimidation may have its place. A 
paladin who meets this challenge and lives up to the ideals of the Flame
 should be treated with respect by the faithful; a paladin in good 
standing should find shelter and support among any community of the 
Flame.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Friars and Pilgrims</b></p>
<p align="left">Ministers and templars are assigned to specific regions.
 Friars and pilgrims take the light of the Flame into dark places. A 
friar goes through the same training as a minister, but instead of 
settling in a single community, he is charged with the task of 
missionary work. A friar travels across Khorvaire preaching the virtues 
of the Silver Flame and attempting to win converts to the church. Friars
 also serve as the eyes of the Church; a friar will search every new 
village for signs of possession, cult activity, or other foulness, and 
then he can report his findings back to the nearest Church official. The
 majority of friars are experts; a few remarkable individuals possess 
adept levels.</p>
<p align="left">The role of the pilgrim is less strictly defined. A 
pilgrim wanders the world. She is not required to perform missionary 
work, but she is expected to lead by example wherever she goes, to 
oppose evil in all its forms. This is the lowest rank in the hierarchy 
of the church, but it still represents a commitment -- a vow to serve 
and protect. Pilgrims are not as well received as paladins, but the 
faithful will still support a passing pilgrim in exchange for a sermon 
or tales of her bold deeds. This is the most likely role for a PC cleric
 to fill: As a pilgrim, she is free to go on any adventure she sees fit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Corruption</b></p>
<p align="left">In Eberron, the alignment of a priest does not have to 
match that of his deity. As a result, corruption is a major concern in 
the Church of the Silver Flame. However, corruption can take many forms,
 and each can have a vastly different impact on a campaign. </p>
<p align="left">The most common form of corruption is when zealous 
devotion causes a priest to set aside mercy and compassion. Such a 
priest may be a pillar of his community and an admirable man who has 
absolute dedication to the Church. But if he must sacrifice the innocent
 in pursuit of the greater good, he will. He will torture and kill 
without remorse. He will not glorify these actions, and will not torture
 needlessly -- but he will not shirk from using dark methods to win the 
battle against evil.</p>
<p align="left">A second form of corruption is greed. The clerics and 
adepts of the Silver Flame are not supposed to sell divine spells; these
 miracles are to be saved for the protection of the faithful. But some 
clerics use their spells to gain gold or influence. Some just want to 
live lives of luxury, but others believe that there are many ways to 
fight evil -- and that political power is a more effective weapon than a
 paladin's sword. While these priests have an evil alignment, they may 
still be working in the interests of the greater good -- at least, as 
they see it. </p>
<p align="left">These two types of priests both have their redeeming 
features. They do not see themselves as evil and may aid the cause of 
good. But then there is the third category -- the priest who knowingly 
embraces the darkness. A second voice whispers in the Silver Flame -- 
that of the terrible demon that Tira bound in battle. Occasionally a 
good priest is led astray by this false flame. However, a few seek out 
this quiet voice and serve the interests of the Lords of Dust from the 
heart of the church. Some believe they will gain immortality or fiendish
 power in exchange for their devotion. Others have been driven mad by 
the horrors of the Last War and believe that the light has forsaken the 
world. Either way, these heretics are cunning and dangerous. </p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately, dealing with corruption is a tricky 
business. The Church does not define evil as "that which can be detected
 with <i>detect evil</i>"; as noted earlier, someone with an evil 
alignment may serve the greater good. Furthermore, a cleric of a good 
deity always possesses a good aura, regardless of her personal 
alignment. Rank within the church hierarchy is another complication: a 
pilgrim can't kill a cardinal and expect to get away with it because "he
 was evil." She will need proof of actions that went against church 
doctrine and harmed the innocent. Thus, a paladin's ability to <i>detect evil</i> allows her to judge the character of those around her -- but it's in no way a license to kill. </p>
<p align="left">When dealing with this sort of situation, a DM should 
bear in mind that a significant difference exists between rank and 
character level. A cardinal may be a high-level cleric. He could also be
 a low-level expert. A high-ranking church official may not be able to 
physically challenge a high-level PC -- but he has the many resources of
 the church and the Templars behind him, and lower-ranking members of 
the Church are expected to defer to his judgment or face sanction and 
excommunication.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Quests</b></p>
<p align="left">The Silver Flame has a simple goal: Abolish evil. There 
are hundreds of options: venturing into Droaam to strike against an 
enclave of monsters; sneaking into Karrnath to destroy a temple of the 
Blood of Vol; battling lurking fiends or possessing demons in the cities
 of Khorvaire; recovering a cursed object and then traveling to the 
Demon Wastes to destroy it; and so on.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prayers</b></p>
<p align="left">Appeals to the Silver Flame are short and direct; this 
religion is born of war, and prayers must be called out in the midst of 
battle. References to light and flame are extremely common. "Light of 
the Flame, guide my arm." </p>
<p align="left"><b>Temples</b></p>
<p align="left">Temples of the Silver Flame always are heavily fortified
 and capable of providing shelter to the innocent. Furnishings are 
typically austere, but elaborate carvings displaying intertwining flames
 and heroes of the church often cover the walls. A brazier filled with 
silver <i>continual flame </i>is set before the altar.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rites</b></p>
<p align="left">Priests of the Silver Flame perform many services. While
 some of these are practical -- ranging from marriage to military 
training (specifically, archery) -- the tasks of the priest also include
 offering guidance and inspiration to the community. Daily services 
provide the faithful with the chance to hear the words of the priest and
 to present their troubles. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Heralds and Allies</b></p>
<p align="left">Tira Miron is the voice of the Silver Flame, and her spirit responds to <i>commune</i>, <i>augury</i>,
 or similar entreaties -- or so it appears. Tira has never manifested 
physically since her sacrifice, and in all likelihood she cannot; she is
 a conduit that allows the Flame to speak to the common races, not an 
avatar to fight its battles. Its primary allies are the couatl, but over
 the millennia a number of noble celestials have heard the call of the 
Flame and chosen to serve its cause. Thus, a cleric's call for aid could
 be answered by an archon, an angel, or something stranger and more 
exotic.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Favored Weapon</b></p>
<p align="left">The favored weapon of the Church of the Silver Flame is 
the longbow. Many believe that this dates back to the battle against the
 rakshasas, who are most vulnerable to piercing weapons. Furthermore, a 
quiver of arrows can include shafts with a wide range of enchantments or
 arrowhead materials, allowing a templar to operate at peak efficiency 
against all manner of beasts and fiends. Priests also encourage archery 
as a form of meditation, and in many communities the faithful can come 
to train at the local church of the Flame. This can result in an 
unusually high number of 1st-level warriors or commoners with Martial 
Weapon Proficiency (longbow) in areas devoted to the Flame.</p>
