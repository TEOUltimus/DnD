<p align="LEFT">You're walking down the street when you encounter a dwarf wearing eight copper rings, one on each finger. You've read the <b>Eberron</b><i> Campaign Setting</i>, and you immediately think, "Hey, I'll bet that guy is a member of the Aurum!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unfortunately, your <i>character</i> hasn't read the 
campaign setting book. Just because a man is wearing eight rings doesn't
 mean he's a member of the Aurum. There's the question of the style of 
the rings, the manner in which he folds his hands when he greets you. Is
 your character capable of reading these signs? This is the role of the 
Knowledge skill -- to determine the things that your character knows, 
regardless of whether you know it. Sometimes it can be difficult to 
determine where a particular fact falls. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Ultimately, the use of Knowledge skills is in the hands 
of the DM. You may have no problem assigning a skill and difficulty to a
 particular Knowledge check. If you find yourself at a loss, here are a 
few pointers to set you on the right path.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Geography</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Chapter Seven of the <b>Eberron</b><i> Campaign Setting </i>includes
 details on a variety of important cities and sites. Has your character 
ever heard of the Torlaac Moor or the Black Pit? For the most part, this
 falls under -- shocking as this may be -- Knowledge (geography). </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Knowledge DC</b></td>

<td valign="BOTTOM"> Hamlet or thorp, obscure fortress or feature (Ringbriar, The Dragon's Crown)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A successful skill check means that you can point to the
 location on the map and that you know basic details about it: primary 
industries, size, most common race among the population, form of law. 
More detailed information may require a higher difficulty check, as 
described later in this article -- or it might require Knowledge 
(local). </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>History</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">With Knowledge (geography) serving your geographical 
needs, it should come as no surprise that Knowledge (history) is the 
source for information about the past. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Knowledge DC</b></td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"><b>Information about...</b></td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td align="center" valign="top"> 5</td>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> 30</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> The Age of Dragons</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">At the DM's discretion, a character could pick a 
specific era (other than the Current Age) as a specialty. The DC for 
checks relating to the chosen era should begin at 5, but checks 
concerning other eras should be bumped up by 5. For example, a scholar 
who specializes in the Age of Monsters needs only a DC 5 check to 
remember a major event, but it's a DC 10 check for him to recall a major
 event of the last 5 years. Needless to say, there is very little 
information available about the Age of Dragons or the Age of Demons; 
even a specialized scholar won't be able to come up with much of value. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Knowledge (history) also is useful for recognizing 
relics of a particular era. If the DM allows a character to specialize 
in an era and the character has at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (history),
 he can choose to forego the usual bonus to Bardic Knowledge and instead
 gain a +2 synergy bonus to Appraise, Forgery, and Decipher Languages 
checks specifically related to the specialty age. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Religion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Can you recognize the symbol of the Emerald Claw? Do you
 know anything about the Cults of the Dragon Below? Knowledge (religion)
 is the relevant skill, but each religion has its own difficulty. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Knowledge DC</b></td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"><b>Information about...</b></td>

<td valign="BOTTOM"> The Cults of the Dragon Below, the Path of Light, the Undying Court, the Druidic sects</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A character always makes checks about his own religion 
at a base DC of 5. In addition, a DM could choose to provide a character
 with a +5 bonus if his region of origin is closely linked to a 
particular region; someone who grew up in the Eldeen Reaches should know
 something about the druids even if he doesn't share their beliefs. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Organizations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>Eberron</b><i> Campaign Setting </i>provides 
details on 28 organizations. How much of that information should be 
available to a player character? What skill should be used to acquire 
that information? </p>
<p align="LEFT">This is not an easy question to answer. House Jorasco is
 a household name, and it hides few secrets. The Dreaming Dark is 
virtually unknown outside of the kalashtar and the Inspired, and it 
could be difficult to prove that the organization even exists. Between 
these is a wide range of groups with multiple levels of secrecy. Most 
people have heard of House Phiarlan, but far fewer know that it trades 
in information or how to properly contact a Phiarlan intelligence 
broker. Many members of the upper crust know about the existence of the 
four concords of the Aurum but the existence of the Shadow Cabinet is a 
secret even to members of the concords. Consider the following when 
determining base difficulty.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="BOTTOM"><b>Knowledge DC</b></td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"><b>Level of Secrecy...</b></td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td align="center" valign="top"> 5</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> Character is a member of the organization</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> 10</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> None (most Dragonmark houses, Morgrave University)</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td align="center" valign="top"> 15</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> Low (The Aurum, the Order of the Emerald Claw)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> 20</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> Medium (The Chamber, the Shadow Cabinet)</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td align="center" valign="top"> 30</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> High (The Dreaming Dark, the Lords of Dust)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">In this case, even choosing the appropriate skill can be
 difficult. Knowledge (nobility) is the default skill for obtaining 
information about the dragonmark houses, and it also makes sense for the
 Aurum, the royal families, and other groups that are centered in court.
 The Lords of Dust would typically fall under Knowledge (arcana) while 
the Dreaming Dark would come under the heading of Knowledge (psionics). 
If a character is a conspiracy buff, the DM might allow him to take 
Knowledge (organizations); 5 ranks in such a skill would provide a +2 
synergy bonus to Gather Information checks when seeking information 
about an organization. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Knowledge (local)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Knowledge (local) is a somewhat mysterious skill. What 
does it mean to have "local" knowledge about the entire world? The DM 
can interpret this skill in several different ways, depending on how 
challenging he wants to make things for a player. </p>
<p align="LEFT">At the broadest, most generous end of the spectrum, 
Knowledge (local) can be used in any location. This represents an 
amazing memory for trivia and a general ability to pick up local customs
 and gossip subconsciously without the need for a Gather Information 
check. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If the DM wants to sacrifice utility in the name of 
realism, he can make a character choose a country to associate with the 
skill -- Knowledge (local/Breland). </p>
<p align="LEFT">As a compromise, the DM could allow a character to 
choose one country for each rank in the skill. This way, a character 
with five ranks in Knowledge (local) could be familiar with all of the 
Five Nations. Whenever she gains a new rank, she can choose a new 
country. Ideally, it should be a place where she's spent time recently.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Knowledge (local) is more versatile than its 
counterparts and may overlap with them. Knowledge (nobility) can provide
 general information about a dragonmark house and its international 
alliances but Knowledge (local) can tell you about the size of the local
 enclave, the name of the local baron, and his personal feud with House 
Kundarak. Likewise, Knowledge (nobility) or Knowledge (geography) can 
provide you with the name of a nation's king but Knowledge (local) is 
more likely to tell you about his rumored taste for virgin blood. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The DM needs to decide how to limit local knowledge. A 
simple, straightforward (but more restrictive) approach is to treat it 
as an extension of the character's other Knowledge skills. Thus, unless 
the character has at least one rank in Knowledge (nobility), for 
example, he can't use Knowledge (local) for checks specifically 
involving aristocrats.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Modifying Difficulty</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The checks described above provide you with the 
difficulty for acquiring the most basic knowledge about a subject. It's 
only a DC 5 check to point to Sharn on a map. If you want to know the 
name of the Captain of the Guard in Lower Dura, that's an entirely 
different question. The DM should apply the following modifiers, as she 
sees fit. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="BOTTOM"><b>DC Modifier</b></td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"><b>Information is...</b></td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td align="center" valign="top"> 0</td>
<td valign="BOTTOM"> Trivial (the name of a city)</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Identifying the seal of a dragonmark house is a trivial 
task. Recognizing the dress clothing of a house is slightly difficult, 
while identifying an incognito heir's house by her facial features, 
style of speech, and manner of dress would be extremely obscure, if it's
 even possible. </p>
