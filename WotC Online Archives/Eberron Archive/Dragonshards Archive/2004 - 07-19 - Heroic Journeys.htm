<p align="LEFT"><i>The thin man pulled back his left sleeve. The mark of
 Passage was spread across his forearm, a complex pattern that seemed to
 be painted with blue light. For a moment it burned with a deeper light,
 and a haze of heat surrounded the mark. Then a vibration rumbled 
through the ground. Seconds later, a bizarre contrivance rose out of the
 earth. Roughly the size and shape of a small stagecoach, it was crusted
 with quartz, volcanic glass, and semiprecious stones. It had wheels, 
yet both the wheels and the base of the carriage were merged with the 
ground. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Well, go on, get in," the man said, opening the door
 to the rear compartment. "We need to be off if we're to reach Marguul 
Pass by nightfall." </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Eberron is a world of pulp adventure. One of the common 
themes of the pulps is travel. In a long-forgotten Lizardfolk temple in 
the jungles of Q'barra, a cryptic inscription leads an explorer across 
the ocean to the unknown wilds of Xen'drik and then down to a sunken 
city in the depths of Shargon's Teeth. But what's involved in travel? </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Riding the Red Line</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">While travel is a staple of pulp adventure, it is rarely
 a significant part of a story. In the Indiana Jones movies, travel 
across the world is represented with only a few seconds of screen time, 
as a red line swiftly connects the hero's starting point to his 
destination. If an adventure begins in Valenar and the next crucial 
piece occurs in the Shadow Marches, it would be fairly dull to spend six
 game sessions covering the trip: what's important to the story is what 
happens at the end of the journey. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In this case, a little description can go a long way. 
"In Taer Vaelestas, you bargain with a Lhazaarite air privateer who 
agrees to fly you to Varna. There, the local Wayfinders supply you with 
magebred steeds and you speed down the great road, exchanging horses at 
Delethorn and Erlaskar. Eventually you find yourself in the town of 
Sylbaran, poised on the very edge of the Shadow Marches." There's no 
need for trouble on the road; the focus of the adventure is on the evil 
that waits in the Shadow Marches. People travel between Varna and 
Sylbaran every day -- that doesn't need to be part of the adventure. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>It's All About the Journey</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In <i>The Three Musketeers, </i>the quest to regain the diamond studs is a series of ambushes and traveling encounters. Much of <i>The Fellowship of the Rings </i>is
 one big journey. If the party is racing against the Emerald Claw to 
claim the Orb of Dol Azur, an occasional ambush or scheme involving 
agents of the Emerald Claw helps to set the tone of the story. Even if 
there is no clear enemy to face, many scenarios that can make travel 
interesting and entertaining if the DM isn't in a hurry. Is the party 
traveling on a lightning rail? Perhaps a band of rogue Oriens teleport 
aboard and hijack the caravan. An airship could come under attack by 
harpies, rocs, or bandits on hippogriffs, or it might crash land in the 
middle of the Mournland. Traveling overland, an encounter with 
hobgoblins in Darguun, zealous Thrane customs officials, a Karrnathi 
undead patrol, or Talenta raiders on dinosaurs can help to establish the
 unique flavor of the different regions of Eberron. It's all a matter of
 balance. If the adventure were a movie, would travel occur in the blink
 of an eye, or would you be willing to sacrifice a fifth of your running
 time to the voyage?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Keeping Track of Time</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Whether the DM uses the red line or the extended 
journey, a critical question is whether he keeps track of time. Eberron 
is a large world; by the maps, it can take an Orien caravan 100 days to 
cross from one end of Breland to the other. Eberron is also a world of 
cinematic action and adventure, so realism is optional. If the DM 
doesn't want to deal with the passage of significant amounts of time 
during the course of the adventure, he has a few options. The first is 
to look at the additional modes of transportation listed below. If the 
party has a patron prepared to provide them with tickets on the Orien 
express, speed is not a concern. The second is to simply ignore time. In
 <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark, </i>how long does it take Indiana Jones to 
get to Tibet? No one knows. It's not relevant to the story, and there's 
no need to worry about it. All that matters is that eventually he gets 
there and the story begins again. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If the DM wants a more realistic game, he probably wants
 to consider how the passage of time affects the rest of the world. If 
the party leaves Sharn and comes back after a round trip of 200 days, 
things may have shifted in their absence. The balance of power in the 
criminal underworld might have changed. An ally of the party might have 
been murdered, providing fuel for a future investigation. Political 
tensions may have flared up: a border skirmish between Thrane and 
Karrnath might threaten to start the Last War anew. This can also 
explain how the Lord of Blades can be back with a new scheme when the 
party defeated him only two real weeks ago: on Eberron, it's been half a
 year, and the Lord of Blades has had plenty of time to plan his 
revenge! Each approach has advantages. The final choice is up to the DM.
 </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Airships, Lightning Rails, and... Horses. </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Eberron offers a few basic modes of travel. </p>
<ul>
<li><img src="2004%20-%2007-19%20-%20Heroic%20Journeys_files/eb_rail_med.jpg" alt="The Lightning Rail by John Avon" title="The Lightning Rail by John Avon" border="0" align="right" height="446" width="199">Characters
 can travel on foot or horseback, just as in any other setting. This 
follows the standard rules for travel as described on page 164 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 Add +1 miles/hour to the unencumbered overland speed of a magebred 
horse, allowing a magebred light horse to travel 56 miles in a day. A 
Valenar riding horse has a base overland speed of 8 miles/hour and can 
travel 64 miles in a day. <br><br></li>
<li>Sea travel follows the overland rules, but most vessels are built 
from soarwood and travel at twice the standard speed. In addition, the 
elemental galleons of House Lyrandar can travel at speeds of up to 20 
miles/hour -- 480 miles/day -- at only twice the standard cost for sea 
travel. When going from Sharn to any port, the elemental galleon 
provides the best balance of speed to gold. <br><br></li>
<li>The lightning rail travels at a rate of 30 miles/hour and can travel
 straight through the night, up to 720 miles/day. However, it too has 
its limitations. It only connects major cities, and the war destroyed 
many rail lines -- notably the path through the Mournland. In addition, 
Orien charges a high price for independent passengers. <br><br></li>
<li>Airships are the latest form of transportation. The typical airship 
travels 20 miles/hour and can cover 480 miles in a day. Airships require
 special docks, and there are relatively few in the Lyrandar fleet. As a
 result, airship travel is very expensive and only connects major 
cities. </li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Low-level groups are not going to have the gold to 
afford the faster forms of travel. The Wayfinder Foundation, Library of 
Korranberg, and similar groups have special arrangements with Lyrandar 
and Orien. If the party is working for such an organization, the boss 
will pick up travel expenses. This can even be a form of treasure: a 
carte blanche providing one month of free use of the services of House 
Orien. Beyond that, adventurers can always try to stow away or engage 
the services of air privateers or rogue artificers who have constructed 
"lightning jumpers," small vehicles that make use of the lightning rail.
 Without a true heir of the house at the reins, such vessels can be 
quite unreliable!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>When You Absolutely, Positively Must Get There ...</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Travel in Eberron will be explored in greater detail in 
future products. If a story requires speed above all else, the DM could 
use any of the following ideas. </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Horseshoes of speed </i>increase a horse's base overland speed by
 3 miles/hour (24 miles/day). There are rumors that House Orien has 
developed a dragonshard focus item that doubles the speed of a horse, 
provided an heir of the mark is within 30 feet. It's said that the 
Valenar elves also have spells and magic items that further enhance the 
speed and endurance of a horse. <br><br></li>
<li>If money is truly no object, an heir of the Greater Mark of Passage 
can teleport you in the blink of an eye. Of course, as a rule this 
service can only be found in the largest cities of Khorvaire. <br><br></li>
<li> Some say that House Orien has developed a small, fast vehicle that 
uses the lightning rail system and is just as safe as the standard rail.
 Similar in size to a stagecoach, these <i>Orien Express</i> cars travel
 at speeds up to 60 miles/hour, or 1,440 miles/day. There are also 
rumors about vehicles using bound earth elementals which can travel 
without the need for rails. However, both of these are theoretical and 
available for use only at the DM's discretion -- most likely, only when 
working for a patron with a considerable amount of pull, or for Orien 
itself. <br><br></li>
<li>Similarly, rumors say that House Lyrandar and the Zil shipwrights 
have produced a small, experimental airship capable of traveling 50 
miles/hour and landing without a full dock. </li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Ultimately, travel should add to the game experience, 
not detract from it. The DM needs to decide when to track travel and 
when it's best to let it slip by in the scene break. </p>
