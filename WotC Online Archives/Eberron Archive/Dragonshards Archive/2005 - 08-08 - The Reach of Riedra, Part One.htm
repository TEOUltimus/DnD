<p align="left">Mysteries surround the nation of Riedra. Most people of 
Khorvaire have heard only vague and contradictory stories of Riedra: All
 wizards and sorcerers are put to death. Sorcerers rule the land. Demons
 rule the land. Gold covers the streets and no one ever goes hungry... 
or the people starve in huts of mud and straw.</p>
<p align="left">If you've read the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>,
 you know the true nature of the Inspired and the goals of the Dreaming 
Dark. But that puts you far ahead of the average citizen of Khorvaire. 
So, what do people know about Riedra? What roles can Riedrans play in 
your campaign? And given the supreme subtlety of the Dreaming Dark, how 
can you actually USE it?</p>

<p align="center"><b>What Do You Know?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (geography)</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 10:</b> Riedra is the largest nation on the continent of Sarlona. Riedra is a sprawling realm that includes all types of terrain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 15:</b> The Riedrans are xenophobes who avoid 
contact with the outside world. Riedra has recently sent ambassadors to 
Khorvaire, but foreigners are still unwelcome in Riedra.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 20:</b> Members of the ruling class of Riedra are 
known as the Inspired. The Riedrans believe that the Inspired are guided
 by divine powers, and these princes are treated as living gods.</p>
<p align="left"><i>This information is also available with a DC 25 
Knowledge (nobility and royalty) check, which will also reveal the name 
of the local Inspired ambassador.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (history)</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 15:</b> Human civilization began in Sarlona. 
Humanity began to explore Khorvaire approximately three thousand years 
ago, led by the pioneer Lhazaar.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 25:</b> Many kingdoms and empires once covered Sarlona. About 1,500 years ago, the Inspired unified these warring states.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (psionics)</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 10:</b> The continent of Sarlona is the center of 
psionic knowledge. Both the kalashtar and the Inspired have a natural 
talent for psionics, and many of the psions of Khorvaire have learned 
the art from a Sarlonan teacher.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 20:</b> The Sarlonans use relatively little magic 
in everyday life, but psionics are used to accomplish many of the same 
tasks that magic is used for in Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (the planes)</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 15:</b> The quori are the natives of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. Quori spirits cannot manifest physically on the Material Plane.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 20:</b> Quori spirits typically possess mental 
powers relating to a specific emotion, such as fear or rage. They can 
interfere with the dreams of mortals, creating horrible nightmares.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 25:</b> While quori spirits cannot manifest physically on Eberron, they can possess willing humans.</p>
<p align="left"><b>DC 25:</b> The Inspired have a strong connection to 
Dal Quor. Some believe that they deal regularly with quori spirits -- or
 even allow these spirits to possess their bodies in exchange for power.</p>

<p align="left">When the Inspired rose to power in Riedra, they cut off 
all contact between Sarlona and Khorvaire. For a thousand years Riedra 
has been hidden from the outside world. To this day, most civilized 
regions are shielded from divination. An adventurer who researches the 
matter will find that a surprising number of wizards and inquisitives 
who sought to pierce the mysteries of Riedra have gone mad -- typically 
driven to distraction by terrible nightmares. Ships that sought harbor 
at Riedra were turned away. Explorers who sought to pierce the veil of 
secrecy never returned. The Riedrans took no aggressive action, but they
 wanted no part of the outside world.</p>
<p align="left">Centuries later, ships of House Lyrandar and the Galifar
 navy encountered Riedran vessels in the Thunder Sea and the Barren Sea.
 The Riedrans established settlements on Xen'drik long before the people
 of Khorvaire, and the pirates who built the foundations of Stormreach 
preyed on Riedran shipping. Through Stormreach, they established the 
first basis of trade, dealing in spices, alchemical solutions, fine 
textiles, and other exotic goods. Foreigners could not set foot in 
Riedra, and the Inspired did not send ambassadors to the court of 
Galifar. But a few small Riedran communities appeared in the major port 
cities of Galifar, managing the shipping trade for their homeland.</p>
<p align="left">It took the Last War and the fall of Galifar to bring 
the Inspired to Khorvaire. When the war had passed its first decade, 
delegations of Inspired appeared in the courts of the newly independent 
Five Nations. Beautiful and charming, these strangers offered their aid 
to the war-torn kingdoms. The medicines supplied (for a fair price, of 
course) by Riedra helped to ease the strain on House Jorasco. The 
Inspired often served as neutral mediators, impressing kings and queens 
with their wisdom and charisma. Foodstuffs from Riedra helped limit the 
impact of Karrnath's famine. Slowly but surely, the Inspired and their 
servants spread across Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Riedrans in the Modern World</b></p>
<p align="left">Today, Inspired ambassadors live in every metropolis and
 in many of the large cities of Khorvaire. Most ports have small Riedran
 communities. Cityfolk see Riedrans on the streets and the docks, 
dressed in the simple clothing of their homeland and speaking in the 
Riedran tongue. As a rule the Riedrans are quiet and insular, keeping to
 themselves and abstaining from most vices. Riedran goods are becoming 
more common on the streets. Virin is a beverage made from Sarlonan roots
 that eases fatigue. Jorasco houses often make use of Riedran healing 
herbs. And on the more sordid side of things, the sale of dreamlily -- 
an addictive narcotic originally brought over for medicinal purposes -- 
has become a major industry in the underworld of Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="left">In the upper echelons of society, the Riedrans have been
 gaining influence. The Inspired have access to vast mineral and 
agricultural resources, along with the prosperity that comes from a 
thousand years of order. The Riedrans have been providing generous 
material aid to all of the Five Nations, helping repair the terrible 
damages of the Last War. This also allows the rulers of the nations to 
maintain their pride: It's easier for Kaius to get grain from the 
Inspired than to have to beg Aundair for assistance. King Sebastes of 
Q'barra is currently receiving military support from Riedra; the 
Inspired have established garrisons in the region around Newthrone to 
help defend the settlers from lizardfolk attacks. Other leaders may be 
considering this; if war looms anew, Aundair could seek Riedran aid to 
defend itself from the larger armies of Thrane or Karrnath -- a 
desperate move, perhaps, but Aurala may be swayed by dreams of the power
 such an alliance might bring!</p>
<p align="left">Kings and queens are not the only people who deal with 
the Inspired. While the Riedran community tends to stay out of sight, 
Inspired ambassadors and their staff are active in their communities; 
exotic and clever, these beautiful strangers fascinate the upper crust 
of Khorvaire. In the city of Sharn, Ambassador Jorasesh often gives 
impromptu lectures at Morgrave University; both Jorasesh and his aide 
Helkashtai attend all of the major galas and social events of the city. 
The Inspired are seen as impartial outsiders, but also respected for 
their apparent wisdom and empathy, and they often provide advice or 
serve as mediators in local disputes.</p>
