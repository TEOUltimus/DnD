<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">In the Age of Demons, the couatls and the dragons joined
 forces to defeat the fiends of Khyber. The couatls sacrificed 
themselves to end this conflict, trapping the immortal demons beneath 
the world and leaving the dragons to rule supreme. The dragons are the 
last children of this first age and are the oldest civilization on 
Eberron. Their knowledge and power is beyond mortal measure. Few people 
ever encounter a dragon -- knowingly, at least. Most of the dragons have
 withdrawn to the continent of Argonnessen to study the Prophecy, sleep,
 and scheme. However, they remain aware of the world around them by 
relying on spies and spells to keep abreast of events on their home 
continent as well as the continents of Khorvaire, Sarlona, Aerenal, and 
Xen'drik. A handful of dragons do travel abroad, but they are usually 
disguised or well hidden.</p>
<p align="left">The dragons of Argonnessen are a nation, not random 
monsters hoarding treasure and waiting for gold-hungry adventurers to 
seek them out. Given the dragons' secretive and reclusive nature, 
finding ways to introduce them into your game can be a challenge. The 
name of the game is <i><b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b></i>, so players may
 come to expect the occasional dragon encounter! This article examines a
 few ways in which player characters may deal with dragons in Eberron.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Chamber </b></p>
<p align="left">The dragons of the Chamber take an active role in the 
world. An adventurer in Sharn could rub shoulders with a silver dragon 
in a tavern -- but most likely, she would never know about this brush 
with draconic majesty. The Chamber is a subtle organization, and it 
prefers to pull strings and act through cat's-paws. The precise 
operations of the Chamber will be examined in more detail in a future 
Dragonshards article. But for now, the important thing is that while the
 Chamber is one of the simplest ways for heroes to cross paths with a 
dragon, they may never know the true nature of the encounter -- and 
thus, the desire to finally encounter a dragon will remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ancient Guardians</b></p>
<p align="left">The dragons battled the children of Khyber in the first 
age of the world. At the end of that battle, the greatest of the fiends 
were imprisoned using powerful magic. But no prison is foolproof, so the
 couatls and dragons placed guardians around these prisons to prevent 
others from knowingly or unknowingly releasing them. Unlike the demonic 
outsiders, dragons are not immortal, but over the millennia generations 
of dragons have continued to carry out the duties of their forebears. 
This could serve as one way for a party of adventurers to encounter a 
dragon in the wilds: a dragon in an ancient ruin, brooding over an 
ancient battleground and taking comfort in a vast hoard of rakshasa 
relics. Such a dragon may offer a warning to adventurers, but then 
again, it may not. The influence of a trapped demon or rakshasa rajah 
sometimes reaches beyond its prison, and many guardians become corrupted
 by their service; even though they continue to maintain their vigils, 
these sentinels become darker and more aggressive toward outsiders.</p>
<p align="left">By their nature, guardian dragons cannot leave the 
regions that they are protecting. They rarely call attention to their 
presence or threaten the local populace. However, there are exceptions 
to every rule.</p>
<p align="left">A number of guardian dragons have been mentioned in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>.
 The most obvious is Rhashaak, who watches the city of Haka'torvhak in 
Q'barra. The local lizardfolk have come to view dragon guardians as 
gods, and Rhashaak has embraced this. As a result, he does wield a 
considerable amount of power in the region because of his lizardfolk 
followers. In the past he has used this influence to gain tribute and 
reverence, but it's possible that he will decide to do something about 
the growing human presence in Q'barra. Rhashaak, like many dragons his 
age, doesn't have much patience for expansionists or curious explorers.</p>
<p align="left">The <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting </i>hints at the 
presence of other guardians. Some say that a brood of blue dragons live 
on the cliffs of Adar, and that these powerful wyrms help those who seek
 refuge in the mountains. And then there is the Lair of the Keeper in 
the Demon Wastes. Stories say that the Keeper -- the lord of death and 
greed -- snatches souls on their way to Dolurrh. Certainly some deadly 
power lurks within this deep chasm, but many sages say that it is no 
god; rather, it is a dracolich, the remains of a dragon guardian infused
 with the power of Khyber.</p>
<p align="left">A guardian dragon could lurk in any ruin or ancient 
site. Only bardic knowledge or ancient lore can provide a party with the
 tools to tell whether a dragon is a guardian that should be left to her
 post or a rogue wyrm that can be struck with impunity. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Rogue Wyrms </b></p>
<p align="left">Not all dragons have an interest in the Prophecy or in 
fighting demons. Dragons are free-willed creatures, and they possess all
 of the myriad personality traits that can be found in humanity. While 
most are content to live in Argonnessen, a few reject the society of 
their own kind. Some simply wish to be alone, far from the watchful eyes
 of the dragon elders. Others may wish to pursue arcane experiments 
forbidden by the rulers of Argonnessen, or to enjoy pleasures that can 
be found only in human lands. Whatever their reasons, such dragons exist
 across Eberron. Here is the lone dragon the adventurers may seek -- the
 deadly creature lurking in its hidden lair, gathering a hoard in the 
darkness.</p>
<p align="left">While the rogue wyrm may fill the image of the isolated 
dragon, remember the cunning and genius of dragons. A rogue wyrm not 
only has to worry about adventurers; it has to beware of the Chamber and
 other agents of Argonnessen. As long as the rogue dragon doesn't draw 
too much attention to itself or its activities, it is usually left 
alone.</p>
<p align="left">Adventurers might stumble onto a rogue wyrm by accident;
 battling a thieves' guild, they could be taken by surprise when they 
discover the true power behind the organization. They could discover its
 hidden lair while searching for ruins. Or they could be sent after the 
beast, knowingly or not. Argonnessen disapproves of rogue wyrms -- and a
 party of adventurers could be the tool they use to eliminate an 
embarrassing fugitive.</p>
<p align="left">A rogue wyrm is the best choice for a traditional 
draconic villain. No tears will be shed or demons unleashed if the 
creature is destroyed. But both DM and party should always consider the 
cunning of the dragon. Part of the creature's power is its intelligence,
 and a dragon rarely allows itself to be taken by surprise. Dragons are 
not simply monsters: They are the children of sky and earth -- the 
legacy of the first age of Eberron. An encounter with a dragon -- rogue 
or not -- should always establish the power and majesty of these 
creatures, and it should always be a significant event.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ten Draconic Encounters </b></p>
<p align="left">1. A group of NPC adventurers finds a green dragon egg 
in a nearby forest and return with it to the city. After selling the 
egg, the adventurers are murdered one by one in grisly fashion. The sole
 survivor, a gnome rogue, hires the heroes to protect him as he tries to
 retrieve the cursed egg.</p>
<p align="left">2. An elf among the party is visited by Cael Vendaelis, a
 distant relative. Cael is a warrior of the Silaes Tairn, a Tairnadal 
sect that has been fighting dragons since the elves left Xen'drik. Cael 
has discovered the location of a rogue blue dragon that slew one of the 
adventurer's ancestors -- and Silaes tradition demands that the 
character avenge this murder.</p>
<p align="left">3. House Phiarlan's Carnival of Shadows has acquired a 
remarkable attraction -- a bronze wyrmling. The elders of Argonnessen 
will not allow the mother to take direct action against House Phiarlan, 
and she asks the party to rescue her child. </p>
<p align="left">4. A patron and friend of the party summons the 
adventurers to an inn to discuss business. As the characters arrive, 
this patron is assassinated -- and his corpse expands to reveal his true
 form: that of a gold dragon. The party never knew his true nature, but 
now they must find out who killed him -- and if whether they themselves 
are in danger. </p>
<p align="left">5. During the Age of Demons, the war against the fiends 
brought dragons to all corners of the globe. While exploring the 
dungeons under a ruined castle in Thrane, the heroes find a tribe of 
kobolds living inside a dragon's skeleton, led by a powerful kobold 
sorcerer.</p>
<p align="left">6. The heroes are assigned to spy on a noblewoman, and 
their patron tells them that he thinks that she is a silver dragon in 
disguise. Although she is interested in acquiring some artifacts from 
Xen'drik and wears a silver dragon-shaped ring, the woman is indeed 
human -- although her intentions may be far from benign.</p>
<p align="left">7. The heroes are hired by a Mror dwarf merchant to 
explore some ancient caves discovered after a recent earthquake. In one 
of the caves, they find a crystal prison containing a trapped demon, 
guarded by a pair of red dragon zombies.</p>
<p align="left">8. While traveling through a manifest zone in Aerenal, 
the adventurers are caught in a bubble of slow time -- and suddenly they
 are in the midst of an all-out draconic assault on the island of the 
elves. </p>
<p align="left">9. While exploring the Mournland, the adventurers 
encounter the warped remains of a Chamber observer. Once a red dragon, 
it is now a skeleton wreathed in an aura of living flame.</p>
<p align="left">10. Long ago, a rogue gold dragon formed an alliance 
with a clan of Dhakaani hobgoblins. Now this Kech Draguus has emerged 
from hiding. With a corps of half-dragon goblinoids and a few 
full-blooded dragons at its disposal, the Kech Draguus are poised to 
reshape Darguun. Will the party act to counter this threat, or will they
 let the blood of dragons seize the throne of Darguun?</p>
