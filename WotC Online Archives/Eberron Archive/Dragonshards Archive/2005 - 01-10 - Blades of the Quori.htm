<p align="left"><i>The Inspired assassin faced Silhareth in the shadowy 
chamber. Her mind blade glittered in the darkness -- a focused shaft of 
pure malevolence. "Surrender, kalashtar," she said. "You are not to 
blame for the folly of your ancestors. Surrender, and let your shattered
 spirit return to the welcoming dark."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Silhareth brought his blade up into the kal jilash 
guard. "You underestimate the kalashtar, souleater. My union gives me 
strength." He concentrated, reshaping his mind blade and shifting to a 
two-handed grip.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"An impressive trick from so flawed a vessel. But you
 have only begun to touch the power of your quori spirit, renegade." As 
she spoke, her blade twisted and grew, becoming a gnarled, glittering 
flail formed from links of razor-sharp chain. In the blink of an eye, 
the thoughtstealer had wrapped the chain around Silhareth's blade and 
pulled it from his grasp; the sword vanished as it left his hands. "And 
it seems you have much to learn." </i></p>
<p align="left">War is the legacy of the kalashtar. The Inspired will 
not rest until the traitorous spirits have been destroyed, and to 
accomplish this goal they must kill every last kalashtar. The people of 
Adar face this struggle every day by fighting a never-ending battle 
against the vast armies of Riedra. In Khorvaire the power of the 
Inspired is limited, and this means that they must use stealth and 
intrigue to accomplish their goals. A Brelish kalashtar may not need to 
fear the Riedran army -- but anyone could be an agent of the Dreaming 
Dark. </p>
<p align="left">This struggle has stretched out for over a thousand 
years, and it has no end in sight. And so those touched by the quori -- 
the kalashtar and the vessels of the Inspired -- are always preparing 
for the next round of battle. </p>
<p align="left">Most quori consider weapons of steel and wood to be 
hopelessly crude. When the children of Dal Quor do battle, they fight 
with deadly thoughts. Most learn the pure arts of the psion, where they 
shape reality as one might mold a lucid dream. But some focus on 
physical combat and fight with fist, foot, or solid thought. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Quori Monk: the Path of Shadows</b></p>
<p align="left">Many kalashtar practice a martial art called <i>sheshan talarash dasyannah -- </i>which
 roughly translates to "dancing with the shadows on the path to light," 
or more commonly "the path of shadows." This serves as a form of 
exercise, meditation, combat training, and artistic expression. The path
 of shadows is a fluid art, full of smooth, sweeping motions that are 
both beautiful and hypnotic. A character that focuses on the pure 
movement of the dance is said to be "staying in the light," while one 
who trains for battle is "facing the shadows." While many who walk this 
path begin as monks, anyone who possesses the appropriate skills and 
feats can be said to be skilled in this art. Balance, Tumble, and 
Perform (dance) are the key skills of the path of shadows, while 
Improved Unarmed Strike, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, and Cloak 
Dance (from the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>) are critical feats. 
Kalashtar monks often take the Monastic Training feat, which allows the 
character to continue to advance on the path of shadows while studying 
other skills.</p>
<p align="left">The Inspired do not follow the path of shadows, but they
 have their own monastic traditions. Different martial arts reflect the 
nature of each class of quori spirit -- the raw power of the du'ulora, 
the sly cunning of the tsucora -- and an empty vessel who trains as a 
monk will usually follow the path of the spirit he will one day embody. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Quori Soulknife</b></p>
<p align="left">The quori are spirits of dream and nightmare. Steel, 
stone, and wood are dull and inert; a quori prefers to work with thought
 and emotion. As a result, kalashtar and Inspired who embrace a martial 
path often take up the mantle of the soulknife.</p>
<p align="left">When creating a kalashtar or Inspired soulknife, think 
about the appearance of his mind blade. For many soulknives, a mind 
blade is simply a shaft of energy. But for a quori-linked character, the
 weapon is an expression of the spirit within, and it should reflect on 
the personality and inner nature of the character. A mind blade is not 
bound by the laws of physics; as a weapon of pure thought it can take 
the appearance of a stream of razor shards, a blade of black glass, or 
bolt of brilliant white light. These cosmetic changes do not affect the 
abilities of the mind blade in any way, but they can add color to a 
character by helping to set the assassin of the Dreaming Dark apart from
 the bold paladin of the Path of Light. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Blended Paths</b></p>
<p align="left">Soldiers of the quori typically draw on three different 
classes: the monk, the soulknife, and the psychic warrior. While a 
quori-touched character may devote herself to a single class, three 
traditions bind these paths together: the jilashtora, ojilashta, and 
tashalantora. These traditions can be found among both the kalashtar and
 the Inspired, and while they are bitter enemies, quori-touched 
characters who follow the same tradition often show a grudging respect 
for their foes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Jilashtora: "Flowing Blades"</b></p>
<p align="left">The majority of the quori warriors are jilashtora, 
"flowing blades." For one of the jilashtora, thought and fist are as 
one, and this path combines levels of soulknife and monk. Mobility, 
Dodge, and Combat Expertise are common among the jilashtora, along with 
the Flowing Blade feat described at the end of this article. Fluid 
motion is the hallmark of the jilashtora, and Tumble and Perform (dance)
 are important skills to those who follow this tradition.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Ojilashta: "Bladeshapers"</b></p>
<p align="left">The ojilashta combine the disciplines of the soulknife 
and the psychic warrior. An ojilashta uses her psionic powers to enhance
 her mind blade, and she reshapes her weapon to suit the needs of the 
moment. An ojilashta wields a blade of dreams, which performs in ways a 
sword of steel never could.</p>
<p align="left">While a soulknife is limited in the shape her mindblade 
can take, a level of psychic warrior will give the character access to 
the <i>call weaponry</i> power. This allows her to produce whatever 
weapon suits the needs of the moment -- a bow for striking a distant 
foe, a flail for disarming or tripping the enemy, or even a sap when a 
victim needs to be subdued. When an ojilashta uses <i>call weaponry,</i>
 it can be described as a reshaping of her mind blade for purposes of 
adding color to the scene, but bear in mind that the new weapon is <i>not </i>a mind blade for purposes of feats or class abilities. </p>
<p align="left">Beyond <i>call weaponry</i>, ojilashta typically manifest powers that enhance weaponry or provide psionic armor. Common powers include <i>dissolving weapon, inertial armor, force screen, metaphysical weapon, prevenom weapon, </i>and <i>vampiric blade</i>. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Tashalantora: "Fists of Fluid Thought"</b></p>
<p align="left">The rarest tradition is that of the <i>tashalantora</i>,
 a path combining the physical art of the monk with the mental power of 
the psychic warrior. Mechanically, this is identical to the Fist of 
Zuoken prestige class presented in the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>.
 While the ojilashta typically focus on combat powers, tashalantora 
often manifest powers that aid in stealth and infiltration, such as <i>burst, chameleon, </i>and <i>conceal thoughts.</i></p>

<p align="left">The most common martial path among the quori is that of 
the jilashtora, in which the discipline of monk and soulknife are woven 
together. At the discretion of the DM, the following feat can be used to
 represent this tradition.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Flowing Blade [General]</b></p>
<p align="left">Your mind blade is an extension of your body and soul, and you wield it with the same grace as your foot or fist.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ability to generate a mind blade, Weapon Focus (mind blade), flurry of blows class feature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> You can treat your mind blade as a special monk weapon so that you can perform a flurry of blows with it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special: </b>A kalashtar or Inspired monk can select 
this as a bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level, in addition to the normal 
options available at those levels. They must still meet all 
prerequisites for the feat.</p>
