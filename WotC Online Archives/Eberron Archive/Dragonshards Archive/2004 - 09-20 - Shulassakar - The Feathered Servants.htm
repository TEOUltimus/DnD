<p align="left"><i>The windows were shuttered against the sun, and the 
room was shrouded in shadow. Daine could barely see the figure in the 
corner of the library. The tall, slender stranger was wrapped in a 
cloak, its deep cowl pulled down over her features.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"You have seen the evil lurking in this place." Her 
voice was a sibilant whisper, low but clear. "Its power increases with 
every soul it corrupts. I cannot move among the people to find the fiend
 Kazalak. You must follow the trail of Kazalak's poisoned touch, battle 
those consumed by the darkness, and find this font of horror. You are 
human, warm and weak, and you cannot stand against Kazalak alone. 
Together, perhaps we can stop this ancient evil before it spreads beyond
 this village."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Daine scowled. "So we corner a demon and hope you'll 
show up to save the day? That's a plan, all right. Why should I believe 
you can stop this thing?"</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"I cannot defeat Kazalak."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"Oh. Great."</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"I am a vessel for the force that will save us all, a force beyond your comprehension." </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Dalassa stepped forward and threw back her cloak. 
Beneath the shadoweave, she wore a robe that seemed to be formed from 
pure white fire. This flared up to fill the room with light and 
illuminate a serpent's head covered with a rainbow of brilliant plumage.
 The feathers rose up around her, seeming to glow with inner fire. </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"I am Dalassakash'alyntar, servant of the flame that 
binds, the light that will not die. Kazalak escaped his bonds but as 
long as the flame flows within me, he shall fall at my hand." </i></p>
<p align="left">In the dawn of this world, the first children of Khyber 
rose from the darkness to dominate the lands of Eberron. For a time it 
seemed that no force could stand against the horrors of Khyber. It took 
an alliance between the mighty dragons and the noble couatl to challenge
 the spawn of Khyber, and this conflict shook the foundations of the 
world. It was a war beyond mortal understanding, a struggle that is said
 to have lasted for a million years. Some say the echoes of the war can 
still be heard in the plane of Shavarath. To break the stalemate, the 
couatl made the ultimate sacrifice; they combined the souls of their 
race into a spiritual force, a silver flame that could bind even the 
greatest of fiends. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Ruins of Krezent</b></p>
<p align="left">The couatl were born on the continent of Sarlona. The 
majority of their ancient ruins lie hidden in the realm of the Inspired.
 As they fought the fiends, they established outposts across the length 
of Eberron. The greatest of these was the fortress-citadel of Krezent, 
located in the heart of what is now the Talenta Plains. The city extends
 down into the depths of Khyber, and by the end of the war, terrible 
forces had been bound in its foundations. A handful of couatl remained 
to watch over the world but they were too few to guard every seal, so 
they sought out helpers among the younger races. According to legends, a
 small group of loyal humans from Sarlona dedicated their lives to the 
service of the couatl. Over the course of thousands of years, this 
devotion changed them in body and soul. By the time the Empire of 
Dhakaan rose to power, the guardians of Krezent were no longer human. 
They had become shulassakar -- the feathered servants. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Children of the Silver Flame</b></p>
<p align="left">The people of Krezent are a wondrous sight: humans 
blended with couatl, with serpentine features and feathers that glow 
with an inner light. The shulassakar are dedicated servants of the 
Silver Flame and will give their lives without a moment's thought to 
combat the forces of darkness. </p>
<p align="left">If these serpent guardians are so noble and wise, why do
 the halflings fear them? Why do the tribes of the Talenta Plains avoid 
the ruins of Krezent and whisper tales of the serpentfolk on moonless 
nights?</p>
<p align="left">The Silver Flame is a force for good but its followers 
are often blinded by its light, and the shulassakar are no exception. 
They fight against darkness with ruthless efficiency and will make <i>any sacrifice necessary</i>
 for the greater good, including the lives of innocents. No one can 
jeopardize the seals of Krezent. The shulassakar seek to repel outsiders
 peacefully before they venture too deeply into the ruins but those who 
persist are dealt with swiftly and harshly. </p>
<p align="left">The shulassakar have considerable racial pride. The 
feathered servants do not believe that any other creature can truly 
touch the light of the couatl. The Church of the Silver Flame, the 
Keeper of the Flame -- these are inherently flawed. While they may mean 
well, they are tampering with forces they do not understand. A 
shulassakar is more inclined to work with a follower of the Flame than 
with any other creature but she will still treat the character as an 
underling or a child. As far as she is concerned, the physical form of 
the shulassakar is proof of spiritual superiority.</p>
<p align="left">The shulassakar consider their serpentine 
characteristics to be a blessing and a sign of their bond with the 
couatl. They believe that a shulassakar goes through cycles of 
reincarnation and that the three different forms of shulassakar 
represent this spiritual growth. Thus, when referring to themselves, the
 shulassakar refer to purebloods as "servants," halfbloods as 
"flametouched," and abominations as "transcendent." </p>
<p align="left"><b>Fighting the Darkness</b></p>
<p align="left">The shulassakar devote their energy to guarding Krezent 
and other couatl ruins scattered across Eberron. They are aware of the 
rising darkness -- the Lords of Dust that have escaped from their bonds,
 the Cults of the Dragon Below, the lurking threat of the Dreaming Dark.
 The shulassakar face these forces directly when possible. A handful of 
shulassakar bloodsworn (purebloods) have hidden themselves among 
humanity, watching for signs of the rising darkness. A shulassakar 
always prefers to solve a problem on its own or to call in a more 
powerful servant to handle the problem. At the same time, the 
shulassakar recognize that victory is more important than pride. </p>
<p align="left">A shulassakar may approach adventurers openly, 
especially if one or more members of the party follow the Silver Flame. 
Because shulassakar have little respect for the young races, however, it
 is more likely that one will attempt to manipulate or trick a party 
into serving its purposes, believing that humans cannot be trusted to do
 the right thing simply because it is right. </p>
<p align="left">If a character earns the respect of the shulassakar, 
they can be valuable allies. Aside from the vast knowledge they possess,
 they have access to treasures from the Age of Dragons and the wisdom of
 the couatl. It is possible that a shulassakar mystic could teach new 
spells to a cleric or paladin of the Silver Flame, showing ways to 
channel the flame that humanity has never discovered. The shulassakar 
also have a close bond with the remaining couatl, and noble shulassakar 
may be able to channel one of these celestials. A human who earns the 
trust of a feathered servant may also earn the favor of its couatl 
patron, which could allow him to channel the serpent himself!</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Shulassakar and the Yuan-Ti</b></p>
<p align="left">Physically, the shulassakar are similar to the yuan-ti. 
There is one major difference between the two races: where the 
shulassakar have serpentine characteristics, their scales are hidden 
beneath brilliantly colored feathers. The mightiest of the shulassakar 
also possess powerful wings. Bloodsworn shulassakar do not have feathers
 but often possess colorful markings on their skin. These are easily 
mistaken for tattoos but they are magical in nature and can shift color 
and shape in response to the mood of the bearer. The extent of these 
markings varies from shulassakar to shulassakar, and generally they will
 not prevent the pureblood from disguising itself as human. </p>
<p align="left">Despite their physical similarities, shulassakar and 
yuan-ti cultures have little in common. The shulassakar claim that the 
ancestors of the yuan-ti were chosen of the couatl who broke their vows 
to the flame and who have since slipped into decadence. As a result, the
 shulassakar despise the yuan-ti. If the yuan-ti shared these legends, 
they abandoned them long ago, and they have no interest in the 
shulassakar. Driven from Sarlona by the Inspired, the yuan-ti lurk in 
the shadows of Xen'drik and the shores of Argonnessen, plotting 
vengeance against the Lords of Riedra and searching for ways to use the 
Draconic Prophecy to gain power. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Using the Shulassakar</b></p>
<p align="left">When dealing with the shulassakar, bear in mind that 
they are highly intelligent and devoted to the cause of good, but also 
proud, arrogant, and ruthless. They will give up their own lives for the
 flame and have no compunctions about sacrificing the lives of humans or
 other lesser creatures. Shulassakar seek to maintain an aura of 
serenity at all times; the only emotion they reveal is cold, focused 
fury against the forces of darkness. </p>
<p align="left">Shulassakar should be treated as yuan-ti, with the following modifications. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">The culture of the shulassakar tends to produce people 
of lawful good alignment. A shulassakar who turns to evil will be 
outcast and hunted by the others. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">All transcendent shulassakar (abominations) possess wings and can fly at a speed of 60 ft (good). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">Flametouched shulassakar (halfbloods) who roll 21-40 on 
the variant table possess wings and can fly at a speed of 60 ft (good). 
For a winged shulassakar to wear armor, it needs to be specially 
designed to accommodate the wings. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">All shulassakar are proficient in the use of the longbow and composite longbow, the favored weapons of the Silver Flame. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">All shulassakar receive Knightly Training as a bonus 
feat, allowing a shulassakar to multiclass as a paladin without penalty.
 Bloodsworn shulassakar (purebloods) are generally ranger/paladins. A 
shulassakar paladin can take the Ranged Smite feat in order to channel 
their power through their bows. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">The favored class for a bloodsworn shulassakar is 
ranger. The favored class for flametouched and transcendent shulassakar 
is cleric. Virtually all shulassakar worship the Silver Flame, and 
skilled shulassakar may take levels in the Exorcist of the Silver Flame 
prestige class. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>What Do You Know?</b></p>
<p align="left">Most people have never heard of the shulassakar. The following skill checks indicate what a character may have heard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (dungeoneering)</b> (DC 15) or <b>bardic knowledge </b>(DC
 15): The character has heard of the yuan-ti, deadly serpentfolk said to
 live in Xen'drik. He recognizes the shulassakar as being similar to the
 yuan-ti, but has not heard of the subculture.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (geography)</b> (DC 25): The character has 
heard tales of Krezent, a ruined city inhabited by serpentfolk, but 
knows nothing of their beliefs or abilities. A character from the 
Talenta Plains receives a +5 bonus to this check. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Knowledge (religion) </b>(DC 25) or <b>bardic knowledge </b>(DC
 30): The character has heard specific tales of the shulassakar, a sect 
of serpent folk who revere the couatl and the Silver Flame. He knows 
that there are exorcists and paladins among the shulassakar and has a 
general sense of their abilities. A follower of the Silver Flame 
receives a +5 bonus to this check. </p>
