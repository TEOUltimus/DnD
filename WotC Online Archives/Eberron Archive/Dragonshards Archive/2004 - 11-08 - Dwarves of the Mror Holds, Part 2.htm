<p align="right"><i>It takes an anvil to forge an axe. </i></p>
<p align="RIGHT"><i>-- </i>Mror proverb</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>National Character</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Mror dwarves are a passionate people. They are 
driven by pride, clan loyalty, and a fierce love of life -- food, drink,
 battle, and all the myriad experiences the world has to offer. Among 
strangers, a Mror dwarf often hides his true thoughts and feelings 
behind a grim mask. But in the company of friends, dwarves embrace life 
with unparalleled zest. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Mror dwarves are fierce negotiators, favoring 
intimidation over subtle diplomacy. Most hold honor in high regard, and 
the oath of a Mror lord is said to be as unbreakable as adamantine. 
Nothing is ever reliable in Eberron, however, and while the Mror may on 
the whole be more honorable than humanity, the word of an Aurum 
concordian is often worth little more than the wind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Mror dwarves have been merchants for centuries, but 
they have been warriors for millennia. Even when Karrn enforced the 
peace of Galifar, the dwarves continued to train their children in the 
art of war. While the Mror Holds were largely isolated from the Last 
War, the orc raiders of the Jhorash'tar remain a constant threat, and 
the crags and chasms are home to ogres, trolls, and far worse things. 
The greatest heroes of the Holds hunt in the depths of Khyber, stalking 
runehounds, umber hulks, and other aberrations in the shadows below the 
mountains. Some assume that because the Mror are wealthy, they are soft 
-- while in fact they are harder than stone and sharper than steel. Gold
 is a new weapon for the Mror dwarves; they have never forgotten the way
 of the axe.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While the Mror dwarves are proud of their young nation 
and the power that they wield, old feuds and rivalries still remain, and
 the dwarves are extremely competitive. Generally these conflicts are 
out in the open; two teamsters will race to reach a destination, two 
merchants will undercut one another; two nobles will back different 
hawks in a hunt. Members of the Aurum are known for pursuing secret 
vendettas with darker and deadlier consequences. Some say that the Aurum
 is a clan in its own right, that its power is greater than any of the 
families of old. Most of the honorable lords feel that the Aurum 
represents a corruption of clan virtues. They say that true Mror are 
iron and gold, but those who serve the Aurum are gold alone -- 
influential but soft and unreliable. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mror Fashion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Humans often see the Mror dwarves as greedy and vain. 
The truth is more complicated. Most Mror dwarves appreciate fine 
workmanship in a way that few others can comprehend; the dwarves will 
literally fall in love with objects. Looking at a beautiful goblet, a 
dwarf sees the toast he will share with his wife (when he finds her). A 
Mror dwarf can tell stories about every valuable object he owns, either 
looking to the past he has shared with his treasure or the future he 
expects to have.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond this, the Mror see personal appearance as far 
more than simple vanity. A dwarf's accoutrements reflect his wealth and 
thus, his power, but they also indicate his appreciation of beauty, his 
judgment, and his intelligence. A poorly dressed merchant has a hard 
time in business. If he cannot judge the worth of his own clothes, who 
will trust his merchandise? As a result, a Mror dwarf may spend more on 
his clothing, armor, jewelry, and weapons than on his home. The Mror are
 stoic and content to endure physical discomfort and hardship. Sleeping 
on stone is preferable to wearing drab clothing. </p>
<p align="LEFT">As a result of this, a troop of Mror soldiers are a 
colorful sight. Dwarven armor is typically coated with enamel or covered
 with complex engraving. Weapons are equally striking; in addition to 
colorful hafts and gilded blades, many are made in unusual designs 
personalized to the warrior. Jewelry is very important to the Mror and 
often carries special significance, indicating rank within a clan, 
military honor, or civic office. A Mror dwarf can recognize the 
significance of another dwarf's jewelry by making an Intelligence check 
(DC 5); any character can recognize the relevance of the jewels with a 
Knowledge (nobility) check (DC 20). </p>
<p align="LEFT">In contrast, Mror architecture is stark and functional. 
Possessing darkvision, dwarves have little need for windows, though most
 buildings are lit out of deference to gnome and human immigrants. The 
Mror dwarves derive pleasure from good company, fine food, strong drink,
 and physical activity. They rarely bother with soft cushions or similar
 comforts. A wealthy merchant is more likely to spend his profits on 
beautiful clothes or finely crafted weapons than on lush carpeting and 
feather comforters. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Mror Dwarves in Battle</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When Prince Karrn led his forces into the Ironroot 
Mountains, he found a culture engaged in constant warfare. The dwarves 
placed more value on weapons and armor than home and hearth, and the 
Mror villages were pale shadows of the cities of Galifar. This was but 
one of the factors that led Karrn to call the dwarves "barbarians." 
While the Mror find joy in battle, they are not raging berserkers. Most 
Mror soldiers have warrior levels, and there are many fighters among the
 Mror Holds. Other combat classes are uncommon, though Clan Droranath is
 noteworthy for having true barbarians.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most Mror soldiers prefer heavy armor and close combat, 
and typically focus on Power Attack and its related feats. Mror warriors
 traditionally name weapons and shields. When a dwarf tells a story 
about one of his many battles, he will refer to his axe as if it were 
another warrior standing at his side. Battlecries are an important part 
of Mror culture. A dwarf may develop his own, or he may adopt the battle
 call of an honored ancestor. Dwarves wish to be remembered on the 
battlefield, and their colorful armor and mighty cries reflect this 
fact. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Elite Mror troops generally follow the path of the 
fighter. Because honor and military skill are both held in high regard 
by the dwarves, kensai and knight protectors can also be found in the 
service of the clan lords. Dwarven defenders guard the vaults of House 
Kundarak, and there are a few frenzied berserkers in Clan Droranath. The
 dwarf fighter substitution level presented in <i>Races of Stone</i> is appropriate for Mror characters. </p>
<p align="LEFT">While Mror smiths constantly improve their skills, they do not possess the uncanny skills of their ancestors. If you use <i>Races of Stone</i>,
 Mror dwarves do not have the ability to produce dwarfcraft items or 
dwarven armor, and they cannot create magic forges. Such items might be 
found as relics of the first age, however, and a DM could choose to 
introduce a smith who has mastered these ancient techniques and learned 
to produce improved armor or weaponry. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Magic among the Mror Dwarves</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">While priests of Kol Korran and Onatar have always had a
 place in the mountains, prior to Karrn's Conquest there was no 
tradition of arcane magic among the dwarves of the Ironroot Mountains. 
It is clear that the dwarves of the first kingdom possessed runesmiths 
and artificers of considerable skill, but this knowledge was lost when 
the clans were exiled from the depths. In recent centuries, the Mror 
dwarves have learned much from working with gnomish immigrants. Some 
clans are beginning to reclaim the secrets of the first age. Wizards are
 still uncommon, but a handful of artificers work in the depths, and 
most holdfasts contain magewright smiths and other simple spellworkers. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mror Gnomes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Many outsiders have trouble with the image of dwarf 
bankers; they see dwarves as warriors, not bean-counters. In fact, the 
dwarves have little interest in book-keeping. The dwarves have the gold.
 They take pride in their ability to protect their vaults. They know how
 to drive a hard bargain. But the paperwork? That's where the gnomes 
come in. </p>
<p align="LEFT">When Karrn brought order to the Ironroot Mountains, he 
paved the way for a massive gnomish immigration. The gnomes of Zilargo 
were inquisitive, diplomatic, and skilled miners in their own right. 
Karrn initially brought gnomes to the mountains to serve as translators,
 mediators, and advisors. The dwarves were more comfortable dealing with
 gnomes than with humans, because clan lords disliked looking up at the 
invaders. For their part, the gnomes saw a tremendous amount of 
potential in the mountains, and many of the gnomish families sent envoys
 east. These immigrants played a major role in shaping the mercantile 
culture of the emerging nation. Most clans have a close relationship 
with one or more of the gnomish clans. House Sivis and House Kundarak 
have very strong ties. Sivis gnomes uncovered the full potential of the 
Mark of Warding and helped Clan Kundarak find its place among the 
dragonmark houses, and Sivis notaries and stonesenders play a crucial 
role in the Kundarak banking guild. Most gnomes in the Mror Holds 
maintain ties with their families in Zilargo, but a few have broken ties
 with the homeland and fully embraced Mror culture. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Because the dwarves place great importance on personal 
appearance, the number of gnome tailors and estheticians in the Mror 
Holds is growing. Gnome <i>prestidigitation</i> experts excel at keeping colors fresh, and wealthy Mror pay good platinum for the latest gnome <i>glamerweave</i> designs. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Clans</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Mror exiled twelve heroes from the deep kingdom and set 
the line of Kundarak to watch them. The great clans are the direct 
descendants of these heroes, and the holds bear their names. Each hero 
was accompanied by a host of loyal followers and servants. As a result, 
there are dozens of different family lines in the Mror Holds. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The great clans are Mroranon, Doldarun, Droranath, 
Kolkarun, Kundarak, Laranak, Londurak, Narathun, Noldrun, Soldorak, 
Soranath, Toldorath, and Tordannon. Kundarak, however, has never been a 
part of the council of clans, and Clan Noldrun was completely destroyed 
(see page 193 of the <b>Eberron</b><i>Campaign Setting</i> for more information). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Questions to Ask </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> When you play a Mror PC or NPC, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is distinctive about your appearance? What image are you trying to project?<br><br></li>
<li>Are you pursuing a feud with a member of another clan? What wrong has been done to you? How serious is the conflict?<br><br></li>
<li>What is the name of your weapon? Do you have a personal battlecry?<br><br></li>
<li>Mror dwarves often collect a particular type of object: jewels, 
goblets, daggers, and so on. Do you follow this tradition? What do you 
collect?<br><br></li>
<li>If you are from the Mror Holds, there's probably a family business you could settle into. Why have you left the holds?<br><br></li>
<li>Will you try to keep your word? If so, be very careful about making 
promises. A known oathbreaker is held in low regard in the Mror Holds. </li>
</ul>
