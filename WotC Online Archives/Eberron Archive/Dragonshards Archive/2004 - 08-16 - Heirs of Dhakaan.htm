<p align="LEFT"><i>"The Crown of Lhesh Dhakaan..." Halas whispered. He'd
 been hunting the relic for months, and now it lay before him. He moved 
forward, reaching toward the priceless treasure. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Defile the crown with your touch, and I will make 
you eat your fingers." The voice was soft yet harsh, filled with a smoky
 music. Halas spun around with his blade already in hand. The speaker 
was a hobgoblin female dressed in black leather armor with silver studs.
 A massive bugbear towered over her, brandishing a great flail. To the 
side, Halas noted a flash of motion and spotted a second hobgoblin, 
dressed in a finely-crafted suit of black platemail that seemed to blend
 into the shadows. That warrior wielded a long chain studded with 
razor-sharp spikes, and before Halas could react, the chain wrapped 
around his blade. A moment later, he was disarmed. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>The hobgoblin woman lifted the crown and turned to 
Halas. "This circlet is older than your race, half-elf. It is the legacy
 of my people, a sign of our dominion over Khorvaire. The time has come 
for it to be worn once more."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The <b>Eberron </b><i>Campaign Setting Book</i> provides
 information about 28 organizations that play a role in the world. Many 
more are mentioned in passing: the Ashbound druids, the Cabinet of 
Faces, and the Trust of Zilargo, to name just three. In time, each of 
these groups will be addressed in <i>Dragonshards</i>, providing you 
with greater insight into the forces that shape the world. This week we 
examine a powerful force hiding in the shadows of Darguun: The Heirs of 
Dhakaan. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>History</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Empire of Dhakaan was built on a foundation of 
martial skill. For thousands of years it dominated Khorvaire, until the 
coming of the Daelkyr. For all of their skill, the Dhakaani goblinoids 
could not stand against the might and madness of the Lords of Xoriat. By
 the time the Gatekeeper druids bound the Daelkyr and their servants in 
the depths of Khyber, the empire was a shadow of its former glory. Over 
the course of millennia it collapsed into savagery, and by the time 
humanity arrived on Khorvaire, all that was left of the empire was 
ruins.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Or so it seemed. As the empire crumbled, a few of the 
greatest generals and leaders took their clans into hiding, determined 
to preserve the knowledge of the Dhakaani through the darkness they saw 
coming. </p>
<p align="LEFT">With the rise of Darguun, the clans have emerged once 
more. If they united behind a single ruler, the Dhakaani clans could 
easily unseat the Lhesh Haruuc, and if they conquered Darguun, the 
Dhakaani could pose a threat to the other nations of Khorvaire. </p>
<p align="LEFT">There is one huge obstacle -- none of the clans agree 
who should be emperor. Who is the true heir of Dhakaan? This issue has 
led to endless conflicts between the modern-day Dhakaani clans that so 
far have kept them from posing a threat to the wider world. </p>
<p align="LEFT">One of the major differences between the Dhakaani and 
the other goblinoids of Khorvaire is the degree of interracial 
cooperation within a clan. Among the Ghaal'dar and the Marguul, the 
strong rule the weak. Leadership is founded on fear, and the weaker 
races hate the stronger tyrants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Among the Dhakaani goblinoids, this is not the case. 
Each species has a role to serve in society, and each embraces this 
role. The hobgoblins rule not through force of arms but because the 
goblins and bugbears respect their ability to maintain structure and 
discipline. The strength of the bugbears is turned against the enemies 
of the clan. These racial roles are examined below. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dhakaani Hobgoblins</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2008-16%20-%20Heirs%20of%20Dhakaan_files/eb20040816a_hobgoblin.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="263" width="200">Hobgoblins
 have always formed the foundation of Dhakaani society, from its 
beginnings to the present day. They are the most disciplined of the 
goblinoids, both in battle and in court. The hobgoblins rule Dhakaani 
society, and their power is rarely contested; their leadership skills 
have been proven over the centuries so that the bugbears and goblins 
accept their respective roles in society. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Hobgoblin soldiers receive highly specialized training 
to serve as infantry, archers, or cavalry. The typical Dhakaani soldier 
is a 2nd level fighter, and all of his feats will be focused on his 
military specialty. An archer will have Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, 
and either Far Shot or Rapid Shot. A cavalry trooper will possess 
Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, and either Trample or Spirited Charge. 
The feats of an infantry soldier vary based on attribute scores. The 
fighting style of the Dhakaani infantry emphasizes speed over strength, 
so Power Attack and its related feats are rarely seen. Common feats 
include Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm, Dodge, Mobility, and Weapon 
Focus. Elite soldiers are renowned for their use of Spring Attack and 
Whirlwind Strike. The Dhakaani are also known for their use of chain 
weapons -- flails and spiked chains. Chain masters enjoy displaying 
their skills with trip and disarm attacks. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A Dhakaani army is both tightly structured and 
surprisingly flexible. The military is based around small units of 
infantry that can quickly adapt tactics and formations to evolving 
combat conditions. Hobgoblins are trained to work together, using 
techniques like Aid Another and flanking to maximize their effectiveness
 against powerful opponents. Dhakaani hobgoblins do not adhere to any 
sort of code of honor in battle, nor do they seek glory like the bugbear
 berserkers. A hobgoblin soldier takes pride in his skills but in battle
 his only goal is to achieve an objective as quickly and efficiently as 
possible, whether it is killing the enemy, seizing a gate, or scouting a
 location. </p>
<p align="LEFT">While there are a few exceptions in folklore, military 
service is traditionally seen as a role for male hobgoblins. Females, 
however, have many important roles in society. The most common form of 
magic among the Dhakaani is that of the bard, and this talent typically 
manifests only among the females of the clans. Dhakaani bards are known 
as <i>duur'kala</i>, "dirge singers"; they are treasured both for their 
abilities to inspire troops and to perform healing magic. The duur'kala 
are the spiritual leaders of the Dhakaani. They use tales of past glory 
and ancestral deeds to bind communities together and inspire them to a 
greater future.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alchemy, healing, and diplomacy are also seen as female 
arts; the male hobgoblins fight battles, and the females heal the 
wounds, both physical and political. While bardic talent is very rare, 
many female hobgoblins have levels in expert, reflecting intense 
training in these advanced arts. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dhakaani Bugbears</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">From an early age, bugbears are raised to think of 
themselves as the heroes and martyrs of Dhakaani civilization. They are 
taught to believe that their strength is the single greatest weapon of 
the Empire. Most are eager to prove their mettle and worth in battle. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Virtually all adult bugbears, both male and female, are 
barbarians of at least 1st level. Dhakaani barbarians are not 
stereotypical savages; instead, the barbarian class represents a 
specialized form of combat training, with the Rage ability reflecting a 
consciously cultivated state of battle fury. In combat, bugbear 
barbarians serve as skirmishers and shock troops, smashing into the 
ranks of their enemies and using their immense strength to scatter and 
break formations while the strictly disciplined hobgoblin ranks move up 
behind them. The favored class of the Dhakaani bugbear is barbarian. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dhakaani Goblins</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">With their prolific rate of reproduction, goblins form 
the largest segment of any Dhakaani community. Dhakaani goblins receive 
far more respect than their counterparts in other goblinoid cultures; 
most fill the roles of peasants and tradesmen, performing noncombat 
tasks that support the hobgoblin and bugbear soldiers. Recently, a few 
goblins have explored the modern arts of arcane magic and artifice, 
especially among the Kech Volaar clan (see page 154 of the <b>Eberron </b><i>Campaign Setting</i>).
 These goblin wizards and artificers are slowly winning respect among 
the clans and becoming an important part of the culture. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Two Dhakaani clans are formed entirely of goblins. Both are renowned for their impressive skills. The <i>taarka'khesh </i>("silent
 wolves") is a corps of goblin scouts trained to provide intelligence in
 the field during military operations; taarka'khesh scouts take rogue 
and ranger levels. The <i>shaarat'khesh </i>("silent blades") are an 
elite order of spies and assassins. The shaarat'khesh have long 
practiced a martial art designed to transform an unarmed goblin into a 
living weapon. As a result, shaarat'khesh goblins pursue both rogue and 
monk levels, using the Monastic Training feat. By ancient tradition, the
 Silent Clans do not take sides in any conflict. Instead, they act as 
mercenaries, providing their services to all sides and fighting their 
brothers when they face one another on the battlefield. This reputation 
for complete impartiality and reliability has kept the khesh alive for 
thousands of years. Its own clan will execute a goblin that betrays the 
secrets of a client. Generally speaking, one must be born into a khesh 
clan to learn its ways, but on rare occasions skilled goblins from other
 clans have gained admission to one of the Silent Clans. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using the Heirs of Dhakaan</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Heirs of Dhakaan have two primary roles in an 
Eberron campaign. The first is as a source of goblinoid opponents that 
can provide unexpected challenges for high-level adventurers. Parties 
that think of goblinoids as pushovers are in for a surprise when they 
encounter the Dhakaani; these goblinoids can have significant PC class 
levels and excellent equipment, and they should respond with the finest 
tactics that the DM could devise. Just like the Lord of Blades, Dhakaani
 NPCs scale up in power as the adventurers rise in skill; Tuura Dhakaan 
and Ruus Dhakaan are heroes of their people and will become more 
powerful in time. Adventurers may encounter Dhakaani treasure hunters 
seeking to reclaim the relics of their empire. If the DM wishes, he can 
play up the fact that these artifacts, by rights, do belong to the 
Dhakaani. An adventurer who lays claim to the <i>Breastplate of Khamvuul Norek </i>and refuses to relinquish it to the Heirs of Dhakaan is, from their perspective, a common grave robber. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Another way to use the Heirs of Dhakaan is to have the 
PCs become actively involved in the struggles between the Dhakaani 
clans. If the Kech Sharaat gain power over the other clans, they will 
eventually pose a threat to the people of the Five Nations. Perhaps the 
Kech Volaar are more reasonable, and the party needs to help Tuura 
Dhakaan deal with her enemies to maintain the balance of power. Perhaps 
Lhesh Haruuc of Darguun hires the party; the hobgoblin king wants the 
characters to weaken all of the Dhakaani clans, to prevent them from 
undermining his newborn nation. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Dhakaani clans are also a good source of goblinoid 
player characters. A member of the Kech Volaar might join with a party 
of humans and demihumans in hope of finding lost Dhakaani treasures to 
return to her clan. For a change of pace, the players could make an 
entire party of goblinoids. Why not see what it's like to play on the 
other side for a while? </p>
<p align="LEFT">Because of their emphasis on the arts of war, the Heirs 
of Dhakaan can be a good way to bring exotic prestige classes into 
Eberron. Perhaps the sharaat'khesh goblins use the ninja class, while 
the most gifted swordsmen of the Kech Sharaat follow a tradition similar
 to that of the samurai. Exotic weapon masters, kensai, bladesingers, 
marshals, and tactical soldiers could all find a place in the clans. If a
 nongoblinoid character wants to pursue one of these traditions, he 
needs to establish a connection to the clan. Perhaps his family was 
enslaved during the Last War, and he earned his freedom through display 
of martial skill. Perhaps he can earn the friendship of a clan by 
finding Dhakaani artifacts and returning them to one of the chiefs!</p>
