<p align="right"><i>Gold is the gift of the mountains, but iron comes from blood and bone. </i></p>
<p align="RIGHT"><i>-- </i>Mror proverb</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Heart and History</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Mror Holds are founded on iron and gold. The 
Ironroot Mountains hold vast deposits of precious metals and rare ore, 
and the dwarf lords have used these resources to create a mercantile 
empire that stretches across Khorvaire. But there is steel beneath the 
jewels and finery of a Mror dwarf -- the heart of a warrior whose 
ancestors engaged in constant battle for almost seven thousand years.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Much of the early history of the Mror dwarves is based 
on fragments passed down through oral tradition and scattered across the
 clans. It is generally accepted that the dwarves first appeared on 
Khorvaire approximately twelve thousand years ago, but beyond this, 
stories differ. Some tales say that the dwarves came from a land of ice 
and snow, which most modern scholars deem to be the Frostfell -- 
although to date, those few, brave souls who have explored this frigid 
land have found no evidence of a dwarven civilization. Others claim that
 the dwarves rose up from the earth itself, that Kol Korran and Onatar 
forged them from the stone of the mountains or that Eberron created them
 to battle the aberrations of Khyber. Every clan and every dwarf has his
 own opinion, and most are ready to fight with anyone who challenges it.
 </p>
<p align="LEFT">Regardless of their origin, it is clear that the dwarves
 were a mighty power long before the present day. Dhakaani dirges speak 
of battles with the "stonefolk of the mountains," and the Dhakaani were 
repelled from the Ironroot Mountains by a unified, disciplined dwarvish 
nation. Even today, scholars observe that Mror battle tactics are 
ideally suited to counter the traditional techniques used by the 
Dhakaani and their Darguul descendents. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The dwarves themselves have many tales from this age of 
glory, though it is difficult to separate fact from myth. Tales speak of
 Stone Kings and Dragon Keepers, of runesmiths forging mighty blades in 
the depths. This age came to an end in the reign of Lord Kordran Mror. A
 number of warriors and heroes had stirred up unrest in the deep realm, 
and Mror banished twelve of the leaders plus their followers to the 
surface of the mountains. The depths were sealed off with magical wards 
and a clan of wardens sent to the lands above to ensure that the seals 
remained until the others "proved themselves to be worthy of the kingdom
 below." </p>
<p align="LEFT">The dwarf lords took many steps to prove their worth. It
 is said that the great stone face of Lord Mror was produced at this 
time, though this is itself a point of some debate. Korranberg sages 
claim that the dwarves simply didn't have the skills to produce such an 
artifact, and argue that they must have sculpted down a larger image. 
For evidence, they point to obscure references to "the face of Eberron,"
 and suggest that "Dragon Keeper" may have referred to a draconic 
monument dating back to the dawn of time. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In any case, when none of these efforts produced 
results, the banishe dwarves fell to fighting among themselve. The 
culture slowly devolved, and while the surface dwarves clung to the 
secrets of iron, they embraced the grim joy of battle. For thousands of 
years the clans fought one another, each seeking to prove its ultimate 
superiority and earn the keys to the kingdom of stone. </p>
<p align="LEFT">When humans first came to Khorvaire, they ignored the 
feuding clans of the Ironroot Mountains. The dwarves were too busy 
fighting one another to take an interest in the world beyond the 
mountains, and the ancient battles continued unabated until Karrn cast 
his eyes toward the region. The young prince guessed at the wealth that 
might be hidden in the mountains, and he wanted his share. With his 
father's permission, he led an army to subjugate the "mountain 
barbarians." Though (or perhaps because) they had been fighting for 
millennia, the dwarves were ill prepared to face an unfamiliar foe. 
Together the clans could have easily expelled the invader, but Karrn 
played on their feuds to divide and conquer the clans. Within a decade, 
the clan lords had bent the knee to the prince of Karrnath. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Having freed the goblins in his conquest of the Five 
Nations, King Galifar was not about to condone dwarvish slavery. Karrn 
was instructed to bring the King's Peace to this savage land. The 
dwarves were forced to stop their warring ways and encouraged to develop
 a new nation based on the model of Galifar, providing tribute to 
Karrnath and the old kingdom. The Karrns surveyed the mountains, but 
they could not pierce the ancient wards, and they drew their conclusions
 from the veins of ore they could reach. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Decades passed. Many dwarves abandoned their old ways 
and spread across Khorvaire. Those who remained in the mountains 
grumbled under the burden of tax and tribute, and slowly their 
discontent pushed them together. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Then came the summons. The dwarves of Kundarak were the 
keepers of the wards, and they called the lords of the twelve clans to 
their hold. In the halls of Korunda Gate the clan lords met in peace, 
discussed their plans for the nation, and expressed concern about their 
future in the Kingdom of Galifar. After a few days of talk, the 
Patriarch of Kundarak led the leaders down beneath the holdfast to one 
of the ancient wards. "At long last, you have set aside your 
differences," he said. "Step forward, and open the gate to the kingdom 
below." As twelve dwarves touched the seal, it faded away, and the path 
to the past was revealed. </p>
<p align="LEFT">What lay below was a shock to all. While the clan lords 
battled on the surface of the mountain, the descendants of Mror had 
fought the Daelkyr in the depths -- and lost. There was no glorious 
kingdom of noble dwarves awaiting their return, only ruins and shadow, 
with terrible monsters lurking in the darkness. Ancient treasures 
remained in these desolate fortresses, and mines still dripped with all 
manner of ore. Slowly the dwarves reclaimed the ancient fortresses and 
the fortune hidden below. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Now that its ancient duty was discharged, clan Kundarak 
-- which had long possessed the Dragonmark of Warding -- was drawn into 
the greater community of dragonmark houses. With the aid of the Zil 
gnomes, the dwarves of House Kundarak established themselves as the 
foremost bankers of Khorvaire. Many of the other clans worked with 
Kundarak, selling their ores and jewels through the bank or serving as 
guards and enforcers. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Through all this, the dwarves remained citizens of the 
crown of Galifar. The dwarves were patient, and most placed great stock 
in their word and the honor of their ancestors; the clan lords of the 
past had sworn an oath to Galifar, and it was not the place of their 
children to break that vow. Even though Karrnath raised taxes, the 
wealth of the deep mines far outstripped this tribute. Many of the dwarf
 lords called for rebellion, but the clans could never come to an 
agreement, and no single clan wanted to act on its own. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Then came the Last War. The dwarves had sworn an oath to
 Galifar, but that kingdom no longer existed. Never again would the 
dwarves submit to the rule of a single king, not even a dwarf. They 
declared the birth of a new nation, a formal alliance of the clans that 
would one day rival the kingdom of old: The Mror Holds. </p>
