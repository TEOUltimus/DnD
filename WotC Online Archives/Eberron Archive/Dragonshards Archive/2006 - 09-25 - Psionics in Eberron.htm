<p align="LEFT">Psionics have been a part of <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b><i></i>for
 decades. But how do psychic abilities actually fit into a world of 
swords and sorcery? What can be done to make them feel integral to the 
setting, and not entirely alien? This article examines some of the 
theories behind psychic powers, and it discusses ways in which a Dungeon
 Master can increase or reduce the presence of psionics in his game.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dal Quor and Xoriat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2009-25%20-%20Psionics%20in%20Eberron_files/eb0925ds_kalashtar.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="339" width="200">The
 nature of the Outer Planes is a subject hotly debated by the sages of 
Eberron. One school of thought claims that the planes are interwoven 
aspects of a single greater reality. Every battle on Eberron has its 
reflection on Shavarath, and even the smallest flame touches Fernia. 
According to this theory, all living creatures have innate spiritual 
connections to many of the planes. These threads are what draw the soul 
to Dal Quor to dream, or to Dolurrh after death.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some think that two planes in particular touch the minds
 of mortals. Dal Quor, the region of dreams, supposedly binds itself 
deeply to the imagination of mortal creatures. Xoriat, the source of 
madness, also serves as a font for all powerful emotions: Some believe 
that overwhelming rage, sorrow, and even joy all flow from the boiling 
well of Xoriat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If this is true, psionic power is the energy of the 
planes channeled and focused through the lens of the mortal mind. The 
psychic surge of the wilder draws on the raw emotions of Xoriat, while 
the focused abilities of the psion are dreams forced upon reality.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sarlona: The Kingdom of the Mind</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sarlona is the seat of psionic power in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>.
 This is the homeland of the Inspired and the kalashtar, and duergar, 
dromites, elans, maenads, and half-giants are all said to live on or 
under Sarlona. The elders of Adar believe that the continent once was 
tied closely to Dal Quor, and that this explains the plethora of psionic
 creatures. However, all manifest zones linked to Dal Quor faded when 
the plane was thrown out of alignment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Regardless of the reason, Sarlona is home to many 
psionic creatures, and it is the simplest place to introduce material 
from the <i>Expanded Psionic Handbook </i>or <i>Complete Psionic</i>. A 
Dungeon Master who wishes to restrict the role of psionics in her 
adventures can insist that psionics have some tie to Sarlona; a 
changeling who wishes to become a telepath may have to find a kalashtar 
teacher in Adar, just as the Shadow (of pulp fame, not the Dark Six!) 
had to travel to Tibet to learn to cloud men's minds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The realms of Sarlona and the powers of its inhabitants will be explored in greater detail in the upcoming sourcebook, <i>Secrets of Sarlona</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Psionics in Khorvaire</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If Sarlona has ties to Dal Quor, Khorvaire has a long 
history with Xoriat. The mind flayers are iconic figures of the realm of
 madness, and the psionic powers of these aberrations are legendary. The
 illithids employed psionic tools and weapons in the war against the 
Empire of Dhakaan, and these treasures could surface in the present day.
 Both daelkyr and mind flayers enjoy corrupting other creatures, and the
 fruits of these experiments can be seen in the illithid heritage traits
 that can appear in almost any creature. Cults of the Dragon Below 
produce wilders and ardents who draw their power from madness and raw 
emotion. Manifest zones could affect psionics just as they do magic; as 
such, a zone linked to Xoriat would be an excellent place to find a 
caller in darkness, and wilders of the Dragon Below would build their 
holy sites in these fortresses of terror.</p>
<p align="LEFT">These ties to Xoriat allow psionics to appear in the 
wilds of Khorvaire . . . but what about its civilizations? If a DM wants
 to give psionics a deeper role in his campaign, here are a few paths to
 explore.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Lhazaar Principalities. </b>The people of the 
Lhazaar Principalities cling to many traditions of old Sarlona -- 
traditions long forgotten by the citizens of the Five Nations. Psionics 
weren't common in Sarlona before the coming of the Inspired, but a few 
kingdoms explored the psionic arts, and a few of the principalities may 
have preserved these techniques, albeit hidden from prying eyes. If a DM
 is using <i>Complete Psionic</i>, the Six Hidden Houses easily could be spread across the inland region of the Lhazaar Principalities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Quori Inspiration. </b>The Inspired and the kalashtar
 are gifted psions, and either group could choose to share their 
techniques with the people of Khorvaire. In the case of the kalashtar, 
this would likely be a purely benevolent action, combined with teaching 
the principles of the Path of Light. On the other side of the coin, if 
the Dreaming Dark begins training psions, it probably has a hidden 
agenda . . . for example, creating a cell that will eventually be 
tricked into serving as host bodies for Quori spirits. The Dreaming Dark
 can hide its hand easily by using possessed humans, so people won't 
realize they are being trained by the Inspired. While the kalashtar are 
likely to focus on powers with peaceful applications, the Dreaming Dark 
may create more sinister forces -- a guild of soulknife assassins, 
mercenary psychic warriors, or telepathic spies, who might not even 
realize the role they are playing in the great game of the Quori.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Optional Rule: Kalashtar and Inspired Without Psionics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you choose not to use psionics in a campaign, make the following changes to kalashtar racial traits.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Favored Class:</b> Sorcerer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Natural Sorcerer: </b>When determining the bonus 
spells received for any spontaneous arcane spellcasting class (such as 
bard or sorcerer), a kalashtar receives a +2 bonus to his effective 
Charisma. This bonus has no effect on the saving throw DC of spells, and
 it does not allow the kalashtar to cast spells of a higher level than 
he would normally have access to. This takes the place of the Naturally 
Psionic racial trait.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b><i>Mindlink </i>(1/day). Use the description of the ability as described in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>. This takes the place of the psi-like <i>mindlink </i>ability.</p>
<p align="LEFT">These same modifications should be applied to Inspired empty vessels, although they do not receive the <i>mindlink </i>spell-like ability.</p>
</td>

<p align="LEFT"><b>National Security. </b>In a time of war, nations are 
always searching for new weapons. With the increasing level of commerce 
between Sarlona and Khorvaire, the leaders of the Five Nations are 
slowly learning about the potential of psionic powers. Many may ignore 
these foreign traditions. Aundair places its trust in arcane magic, 
while Thrane relies on the divine might of the Silver Flame. However, 
Karrnath and Breland may choose to explore the psionic arts, either to 
find ways to counter telepathic spies or to create their own psychic 
operatives. The King's Dark Lanterns of Breland may be training a unit 
of lurks, while the Karrns are exploring the battlefield potential of 
kineticists. Of course, what happens if the top psions in the agency 
turn out to be Quori sleeper agents?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Removing Psionics from Eberron</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This article focuses on ways to expand the role of psionics in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>.
 However, some Dungeon Masters may prefer to remove these powers 
entirely, creating a world in which magic is the sole source of 
supernatural power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">By default, the primary vector for psionics are the 
kalashtar, Inspired, and land of Sarlona. If a DM wants to ignore 
psionics, the simplest answer is to strip these elements from the game. 
It's easy enough to say that the Quori remain trapped in Dal Quor and 
never touched the minds of mortals; all that remains is for the DM to 
decide what new force dominates Sarlona. The Lords of Dust could be the 
masters of Riedra. It might be a kingdom of aberrations, ruled by 
illithid tyrants and vile aboleths. Or it might be a mundane human 
nation, maintaining traditions abandoned by the settlers of Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a DM doesn't want to use psionics, but still enjoys 
the story of the kalashtar and their struggle against the Dreaming Dark,
 there are other options. Instead of psychic power, the kalashtar and 
Inspired could be natural sorcerers, with an innate talent for shaping 
arcane energy. A DM who takes this approach may wish to create an arcane
 equivalent of the <i>mind seed </i>power, as this is a critical tool 
for the Quori agenda; if such a spell exists, it will be a closely 
guarded treasure of the Dreaming Dark.</p>
