<p align="left"><b>The Dead and the Deathless</b></p>
<p align="left">The Aereni elves care for all of their dead. The elves 
have perfected the art of embalming, and some practice this trade in the
 great cities of Khorvaire. As an elf's body is prepared for burial, two
 chronicles of her life are made. One copy is buried with her body and 
one kept in the great library of Shae Mordai; thus she will never be 
forgotten, and anyone who finds her body in a future age will know of 
her deeds. The bodies of the fallen are preserved in catacombs that 
stretch deep beneath the cities of Aerenal, filled with the assembled 
dead of thirty thousand years. Grave robbing is considered a heinous 
crime in Aerenal, and someone who knowingly transgresses against the 
fallen may be killed and cremated, with no record made of his death.</p>
<p align="left">The elves reserve the gift of immortality for their 
greatest heroes. The Aereni respect knowledge and wisdom as well as 
martial skill, and the Undying Court includes sages and artists and well
 as warriors and wizards. But most elves are consigned to the catacombs 
after death. Traditionally an elf can become deathless only after she 
has lived three centuries. The Priests of Transition view life as a 
journey, with undeath as a destination; even those worthy of the honor 
must experience a full life to appreciate what comes next. However, an 
elf who shows great promise may be raised from the dead, so that she can
 continue on the path of life.</p>
<p align="left">A deathless elf does not automatically become a member 
of the Undying Court. Military heroes usually become undying soldiers; 
they continue to defend of the nation and exist in the catacombs and all
 of the major cities of Aerenal. Newly raised undying councilors serve 
as sages and administrators -- although the living perform the most 
vital tasks, so that they may complete the journey of life and avoid 
becoming dependant on the Undying. After a thousand years, a councilor 
is considered for admittance into the court, where she will tend the 
ascendant councilors and study with the elders. What happens next is a 
mystery the mortal mind cannot understand; the ascendant councilors are 
truly alien beings who are thousands of years old and charged with the 
energy of Irian.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Magic of Aerenal</b></p>
<p align="left">The elves of Aerenal were using <i>continual flame </i>while
 humans were struggling with fire. Each generation has added new 
enchantments and artifacts to the great cities of the island, and Pylas 
Talaer has magical wonders that outshine even Sharn. Many cities contain
 buried orbs enchanted with a powerful form of <i>prestidigitation; </i>people
 passing through an Aereni city may hear ghostly music, and they will 
find that their clothing, hair, and skin remains perfectly clean. Rumors
 claim that the nobles maintain a network of teleportation gates that 
connect the great cities, but if these tales are true, the gates are 
reserved for the important business of the nobility.</p>
<p align="left">The elves of Aerenal consider arcane magic to be both a 
science and an art. Most elves have a natural gift for wizardry and find
 it far easier to follow this path than humans do. While most of the 
inhabitants of Aerenal are commoners or experts, many possess a level or
 two of wizard, and professional wizards are as common on Aerenal as 
magewrights are in Khorvaire. While there is a general interest in 
necromancy, most of these wizards focus on practical magic -- <i>Tenser's floating disk, unseen servant, prestidigitation, magecraft, </i>and similar spells.</p>
<p align="left">While many consider necromancy to be the magic of death,
 for the Aereni it is far more. In studying death, the Aereni wizard 
learns about life. In studying fear, he learns about hope. To the elves 
of Aerenal, the study of necromancy is as much a philosophical voyage as
 a quest for power; the wizard's ability to strike down his enemy with a
 <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>is a side benefit of his work, not the point
 of it. The one path that the Aereni avoid is the creation of negatively
 charged undead: vampires, liches, wraiths, and the like. The Aereni 
believe that these creatures are anathema to life. According to Aereni 
lore, the deathless are sustained by the energy of Irian and the 
devotion of their descendents -- energy that is freely given. Negative 
undead take the energy they need to survive -- siphoning away the life 
energy of Eberron itself. Karrnathi necromancers scoff at this belief, 
but the Aereni take it very seriously.</p>
<p align="left">Aerenal contains a number of manifest zones that are 
closely linked to Mabar and Irian. These empower necromantic spells, and
 Aereni wizards and clerics have developed a number of necromantic 
rituals that can be performed only in these areas. While deathless can 
leave the island, the Aereni believe that the Undying Court relies on 
the energy of Irian to maintain its bond to this plane of existence; as a
 result, the ascendant councilors of the court rarely venture from Shae 
Mordai, which is the site of the largest of the Irian zones.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Style and Customs </b></p>
<p align="left">The Aereni seek perfection in everything that they do. 
Elven clothing is beautiful, typically involving interwoven patterns in 
two or three different colors. But beyond appearance, Aereni clothing is
 designed for function: An elven shirt may last its wearer for twenty or
 thirty years, holding its colors to the end. The elves put equal care 
into architecture, and some buildings in Shae Mordai are over twenty 
thousand years old. The elves build their cities from densewood and 
livewood, creating wooden structures that are just as tough and enduring
 as buildings of stone.</p>
<p align="left">While the elves take great pleasure in crafting things 
of beauty, they have unusual ideas about physical beauty. To a follower 
of the Undying Court, the body is a temporary vessel. Aging and even 
death are not things to fear -- they are part of the journey of life. 
The deathless do slowly decompose, and to an elf who plans to spend 
eternity as one of the undying, physical beauty is a trivial thing. To a
 large degree, this simply means that the Aereni do not concern 
themselves with cosmetics to the degree that many other humanoids do. 
Masks are a common fashion accessory among the elves, and the holy 
symbol of the Undying Court is a golden mask. Some elves take things a 
step farther and actually disfigure themselves in life -- abandoning 
physical beauty to be better prepared for what is to come.</p>
<p align="left">While the Aereni place more importance on mystical 
knowledge than military might, they still respect the martial traditions
 of their ancestors. Every elf learns to use sword and bow as a child, 
and archery and stylized duels are a common form of recreation. For the 
average elf, this is as much a mental exercise as it is physical. Much 
like their Tairnadal cousins, the Aereni see war as an art. Aereni 
soldiers usually rely on speed and skill as opposed to brute force. 
Swashbucklers and scouts are common among the Aereni, but the island has
 its fair share of fighters -- deadly warriors focused in the paths of 
archery or Combat Expertise.</p>
<p align="left">To an outsider, Aereni often seem cold and repressed. 
This is not actually the case; the elves feel emotions as strongly as 
any other race. They simply don't display their feelings as blatantly as
 members of the younger races, and they rarely reveal their thoughts to 
strangers. Aereni do possess a sense of humor, but it is quite 
sophisticated; an Aereni joke may take an hour or day to come to 
fruition. Humans generally find Aereni humor to be dull or confusing, 
while the elves consider the culture of the Five Nations to be 
simplistic and crass -- though it can be excused on account of youth.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Questions to Ask</b></p>
<p align="left">As an elf from Aerenal, a critical question you need to 
answer is why you have left your homeland. The Aereni rarely travel; 
their island is a sacred place, while Khorvaire is a land of chaos and 
ignorance. You may be searching for a way to achieve your full 
potential, in the hopes of being raised to the nobility and eventually 
to the Undying Court. You could be one of the undead hunters of the 
Deathguard, or a spy in the service of the Cairdal Blades. You may be 
acting on behalf of your line -- or perhaps you have a patron in the 
Undying Court itself, who has asked you to be his eyes in the world 
beyond Shae Mordai. Or perhaps you believe that the culture of Aerenal 
is stagnant, and you have turned your back on your land, searching for 
wisdom in the world of the younger races.</p>
<p align="left">Here are some other things you may want to consider: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the history of your line? The line of Jhaelian is deeply 
spiritual, producing many of the most powerful adepts and clerics of 
Aerenal. Does your line have a particular tradition of magic or martial 
skill? <br><br></li>
<li>Who are your parents? One of your biological parents will be a 
member of the noble house of your line. Do you have a close connection 
with her, or have you never had a bond?<br><br></li>
<li>The Right of Counsel feat represents a close tie to a particular 
member of the Undying Court. All Aereni have ancestors in the Undying 
Court: to earn the Right of Counsel, you have to have performed great 
deeds or otherwise show remarkable potential. If you have this feat, you
 and your DM need to decide who your patron is, and how you came to his 
attention.<br><br></li>
<li>The Aereni elves are raised to be patient. You may live for 
thousands of years; as an adult elf, you've already lived longer than 
the average human will. Take your time when making decisions. Don't jump
 to conclusions or let your emotions force you into rash action. 
Cultivate calm. <br><br></li>
<li>As an elf of Aerenal, you have been taught that physical appearance 
is ultimately irrelevant. Don't judge people by their appearance; while 
others may be seduced by beauty or horrified by disfigurements, to you 
these are simply transitory aspects of life. </li>
</ul>
