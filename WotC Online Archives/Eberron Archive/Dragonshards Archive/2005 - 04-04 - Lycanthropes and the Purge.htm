<p align="left">In Eberron, the alignment of a lycanthrope is not linked
 to her animal form. A werebear can be evil and a werewolf can be good. 
Lycanthropes carrying an evil strain are some of the most terrifying 
creatures on Eberron: While a natural werewolf may wear a human shape, 
she is a born predator who takes joy in spilling human blood. Those 
afflicted by the disease suffer a dramatic change in personality, 
regardless of the alignment of the victim before and after the curse. As
 a result, lycanthropes of all types have always been feared. Under the 
best circumstances, the bite of a lycanthrope means a loss of identity; 
in the worst, it can make a good person into a vicious killer.</p>
<p align="left">For an afflicted lycanthrope, this mental transformation
 is permanent. Even the strongest will crumbles before the supernatural 
power of the disease -- and only magical effects such as <i>miracle </i>or <i>atonement </i>can
 restore the former personality of the victim. A natural lycanthrope 
cannot be cured; the disease is a part of her body and soul, and it 
cannot be stripped away. The lycanthrope born into evil may find the 
strength to become good, but she will always feel the predator in the 
back of her mind, urging her to prey on the weak and innocent. </p>
<p align="left">The origin of lycanthropy remains a mystery that defies even divination; <i>commune </i>and <i>legend lore</i>
 produce cryptic and often contradictory statements about moons made 
flesh and the darkness within. The sages of Arcanix and the Library of 
Korranberg have produced many theories, tracing the disease to the 
daelkyr, the Gloaming, manifest zones bound to Lamannia, or ancient 
druids. A more exotic theory comes from the Eldeen Reaches. A number of 
shifter tribes believe that the moons of Eberron are powerful spirits 
that watch the world below. These shifters maintain that the shifter 
race is not descended from lycanthropes: Rather, the first lycanthropes 
were formed from shifters. According to this legend, the moon Olarune 
sought to create guardians who could protect the world of nature; 
reaching down from the sky, she touched a handful of chosen shifters, 
granting them the power to fully assume animal form. But the 
moonspeakers say that a thirteenth spirit is in the sky -- a dark moon 
that hides its face from the world. This darkness corrupted Olarune's 
gift, infecting many of her chosen with madness and evil. Or so the tale
 is told. Shifters with these beliefs have hunted evil lycanthropes for 
centuries: they simply lacked the resources to eliminate the threat. 
While these hunters are a minority among the shifters, as a race the 
shifters have no great love for lycanthropes. A shifter community may 
take risks to shelter a good lycanthrope, but no sensible person would 
knowingly welcome an evil werewolf into his home. </p>
<p align="left">While no one knows how lycanthropy began, most know of 
the purge that almost brought it to an end. Around 800 YK, the power of 
the curse began to grow. The scholars of Aundair sought an answer in 
planar conjunctions or the influence of unknown fiends, while deep in 
the Eldeen Reaches shifter moonspeakers bemoaned the growing power of 
the unseen moon. Evil lycanthropes -- always the most numerous of the 
shapeshifters -- became even more vicious, and many good and neutral 
lycanthropes were corrupted and drawn down to the darkness. Afflicted 
lycanthropes gained the ability to pass the curse to their own victims, 
allowing lycanthropy to spread with terrifying speed. By the early years
 of the ninth century, packs of werewolves were roaming across western 
Khorvaire and wererats had established warrens beneath the greatest 
cities of the age. Farmers lived in fear of wolves that walked like 
humans. What was once a superstition used to frighten children was now 
horrifying reality. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Purge </b></p>
<p align="left">The templars of the Church of the Silver Flame had 
fought shapeshifters in the past. But the heart of the Church of the 
Silver Flame was in the nation of Thrane, far from the traditional 
Eldeen haunts of the lycanthropes. As the death toll mounted in Aundair 
and Breland, the cardinals grew increasingly concerned and the templars 
began to take a more active role in the defense of the western lands. 
The puritan scholars of the Silver Flame began to study their enemies. A
 number of factors colored this research:</p>
<ul>
<li> The subjects of study were evil lycanthropes. Good lycanthropes 
were rare and reclusive to begin with, and many had fallen prey to the 
growing power of the curse. As a result, the puritans quickly assumed 
that all lycanthropes were inherently evil.<br><br></li>
<li>Many priests noticed the similarity between the hybrid forms of the 
lycanthropes and the common form of the rakshasa, and asserted that 
lycanthropes were demons or would become true fiends in time.<br><br></li>
<li> Curing lycanthropy is a difficult challenge. Natural lycanthropes 
cannot be cured, and an afflicted lycanthrope can be cured only if it 
wants to be; the shapeshifter can always choose to fail the associated 
Will saving throw. The first priests who sought a cure decided that it 
was impossible; only in the last decades of the purge did a band of more
 moderate and moral priests prove that it could be done.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition to this flawed research, the Keeper of the 
Flame had an agenda of his own. Jolan Sol saw the situation as an 
opportunity to strengthen the influence of the Silver Flame in Aundair. 
In 832 YK he proclaimed that the curse of lycanthropy corrupted the soul
 itself. This announcement spread fear throughout Breland and Aundair 
and strengthened the resolve of the armies of the Flame, who ventured 
west with the goal of eradicating the plague from the face of Eberron. </p>
<p align="left">The battle was long and brutal. Today, many assume that 
the lycanthropes were hunted prey, fleeing from the overwhelming force 
of the Church of the Silver Flame. Little could be further from the 
truth. The typical wereboar is far deadlier than the average templar of 
the Flame, and even if the soldier defeats his prey, one good bite is 
all it takes to transfer the curse and create a new wereboar. Evil 
werewolves infected entire villages, and wererats took great pleasure in
 infecting templars, imprisoning them until the curse took hold, and 
then sending them against their former allies. Clever lycanthropes 
fanned the puritans' paranoia toward the shifters, and these mistrustful
 folk massacred hundreds of shifters before someone could prove to them 
that shifters did not carry the curse. While some of the shifters later 
fought alongside the templars, many have never forgiven the Silver Flame
 -- and, indeed, humanity -- for these deaths. </p>
<p align="left">As the tide slowly began to turn in the favor of the 
Church of the Silver Flame, the challenge became one of finding the 
lycanthropes hidden among human and shifter communities. Here again, 
many puritans acted with overzealous aggression, harming the innocent in
 their desperate quest to eliminate the remaining shapeshifters. 
Ultimately House Medani produced dragonshard foci that could detect 
lycanthropes and guide the templars to the true foe, and this heralded 
the end of the purge. By 880 YK, the Church of the Silver Flame withdrew
 its forces from the Eldeen Reaches, claiming that the threat of the 
curse had finally been eliminated.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lycanthropes in the Modern Age</b></p>
<p align="left">Today, the balance of power within the Church of the 
Silver Flame has shifted toward the moderates, and many feel shame and 
regret for the actions of their predecessors. While the evil 
lycanthropes needed to be stopped, the paranoia and zealotry of the age 
led to the death of innocents. However, it did accomplish one goal: The 
Silver Flame did gain many supporters as a result of the purge, and 
Aundair is the stronghold of the puritan faction in the modern age. The 
puritans refuse to see the purge as anything but a triumph; most have 
been raised on tales of the horrors of the early ninth century. They 
feel no shame about the deaths of non-evil lycanthropes or afflicted 
victims who might have been cured; in the eyes of the puritans, 
lycanthropes are monsters -- and the duty of the templar is to defend 
the innocent from evil, not to feel pity for monsters. </p>
<p align="left">While the Church of Thrane no longer follows Jolan Sol's
 doctrines, the church continues to hunt shapeshifters in the present 
day. Jaela Daran has ordered templars to subdue lycanthropes whenever 
possible and to accept the surrender of any lycanthrope, so that the 
shapeshifter can be cured or exiled to Lamannia. However, if a 
lycanthrope does not cooperate, the templars use lethal force. This is 
covered under provisions in the Code of Galifar; the templars of the 
Church are authorized to defend the people of the Five Nations against 
supernatural threats, and a lycanthrope who willfully maintains his 
condition is seen as intentionally endangering others. The puritans of 
Aundair are infamous for ignoring Jaela's edicts, and most Aundairian 
templars show no mercy when dealing with lycanthropes.</p>
<p align="left">While cardinals and Keeper maintain that lycanthropy is a
 threat, rumors have spread regarding exceptional lycanthropes who have 
been allowed to remain on Eberron. Some say that the Church captured a 
werebear who had been fighting aberrations in the Eldeen Reaches, and 
that the Keeper of the Flame released him into the wild after hearing 
his tale. Some Aundairian puritans spread gossip that declares that 
Jaela herself is a lycanthrope; if the tales hold truth, it could be 
that the Silver Flame selected her to attempt to heal the damage done in
 its name. Between common prejudice and the need to settle things with 
the Church, Eberron is a challenging setting for lycanthropic PCs. But 
the persecuted hero who must struggle with his own dark impulses can be a
 fascinating protagonist, and such a character can certainly find a 
place in Eberron. </p>
