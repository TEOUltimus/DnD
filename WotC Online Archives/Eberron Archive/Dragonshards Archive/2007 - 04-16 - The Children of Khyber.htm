<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-16%20-%20The%20Children%20of%20Khyber_files/eb20070416_dragonshard_dragonmarked.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="303" width="240">The
 aberrant lords of the War of the Mark wielded terrible powers. Madness,
 flame, and plague were the least of their weapons. These tales inspired
 the superstitions that haunt the bearers of aberrant dragonmarks to 
this day. But in the centuries since the War of the Mark, no aberrant 
mark has ever bestowed the sort of powers seen in the past.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Until now. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Over the last few years, aberrant marks have been 
appearing with greater frequency. And for the first time in over a 
thousand years, some who carry these marks have seen the twisted sigil 
grow in size and power . . . mirroring the Lesser and Greater 
Dragonmarks of the pure houses. These are the children of Khyber: the 
aberrant lords of the age to come.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The child of Khyber is a prestige class designed for characters that bear aberrant marks. It draws on material presented in the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/953807200">Dragonmarked </a></i> sourcebook, notably the Lesser Aberrant Dragonmark and Greater Aberrant Dragonmark feats. While you will thus need <i>Dragonmarked</i>
 to pursue this prestige class, the background information presented 
here should prove useful to any character that possesses an aberrant 
dragonmark.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Becoming a Child of Khyber</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like the pure dragonmarks, aberrant dragonmarks are a 
mystery. One cannot simply choose to be a child of Khyber. It may be 
random chance, or the Dragon Below may be picking its champions in a war
 that is to come. However it works, the power seems to choose its 
vessel, not the other way around. Most children of Khyber do share a few
 common traits aside from their dragonmarks: They are uniformly gifted 
people -- a cut above the common masses. And most possess a dark outlook
 on life; while they may not be evil, many are cynical, ruthless, 
brooding, selfish, or even insane. This could reflect the influence of 
the aberrant dragonmark, or merely the fact that those who bear aberrant
 marks often lead difficult lives: Whatever the reason, truly noble 
souls cannot become children of Khyber. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If your character meets the prerequisites, you can 
choose to make him a child of Khyber. But this is not the result of a 
conscious choice on his part; it does not reflect training or 
dedication. One day, his aberrant dragonmark grows larger, and he feels 
the dark power of Khyber in his blood. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Child of Khyber Entry Requirements</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alignment:</b> Any nongood<br><b>Skills:</b> 7 ranks in any two skills<br><b>Feat:</b> Aberrant Dragonmark</p>
<p align="LEFT">At present, most children of Khyber are loners. However,
 the criminal House Tarkanan is extremely interested in recruiting the 
children of Khyber. Many of the Cults of the Dragon Below believe those 
who bear aberrant dragonmarks are blessed by Khyber, and aberrant heirs 
can wield great influence among such cults. The children of Khyber are 
few in number and spread across Khorvaire, but as more time passes, more
 and more will place their powers in the service of a greater cause. </p>

Silently, Open Lock, Search, Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, Spot,

<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As a child of Khyber, your greatest strength is the 
power of your aberrant dragonmark. As you advance in the class, you 
unlock the hidden powers of your mark, while learning skills that can 
help you survive in an unfriendly world. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aberrant Affinity (Ex): </b>As you master the powers 
of you aberrant mark, you gain a measure of influence over others 
touched by Khyber's power. You may add your class level to all 
Charisma-related checks dealing with aberrations or people who possess 
aberrant dragonmarks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lesser Aberrant Dragonmark: </b>At 1st level you gain Lesser Aberrant Dragonmark as a bonus feat. You do not have to meet the skill prerequisites for the feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Additional Action Points (Ex): </b>At 2nd level and beyond, your action point maximum per level is increased by 2.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Aberrant Dragonmark (Ex): </b>Beginning at 2nd level, you may use the spell-like ability granted by your aberrant dragonmark one additional time per day. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Lesser Aberrant Dragonmark (Ex): </b>Beginning
 at 2nd level, you may use the spell-like ability granted by your lesser
 aberrant dragonmark one additional time per day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greater Aberrant Dragonmark: </b>At 4th level you gain Greater Aberrant Dragonmark as a bonus feat. You do not have to meet the skill prerequisites for the feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aberrant Burst (Ex): </b>At 5th level you gain the 
ability to call on inner reserves of strength to fuel your aberrant 
dragonmark, but this leaves you drained and ill. Once per day when you 
use one of your aberrant dragonmark powers, you can declare it to be an 
aberrant burst. The caster level and saving throw DC of the effect are 
both increased by 3; however, you are sickened for 1d4 rounds after 
using the ability. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Playing a Child of Khyber</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can feel your power festering within you. It's 
different for every child of Khyber. One feels a chill no warmth can 
push away, while another complains of fire burning beneath his skin. An 
heir with the power of <i>confusion </i>feels the force of madness in 
his mind, trying to claw its way out and feast on the thoughts of 
others. Your mark may bring you pain. It may whisper to you as you try 
to sleep. But it is a part of you. To others it may sound like a curse; 
but without that knot of dark energy within, you don't know who you'd 
be. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Odds are you've had a difficult life. Most aberrant 
heirs do. Even before your mark appeared, you felt a distance from those
 around you. And how did your mark first manifest? Did you char a 
childhood friend with an accidental burst of flame, or <i>charm </i>the 
object of your unrequited affections? Whatever happened, once the mark 
appeared, you were likely the subject of fear and suspicion. Perhaps you
 were driven from your home, or perhaps you chose to travel, hiding your
 mark and finding comfort in the company of strangers. Only one friend 
has remained with you through all your journeys -- that twisted mark 
that burns on your skin, the power waiting to be unleashed. </p>
<p align="LEFT">And now your mark is growing. Not just the sigil on the 
skin, or the power you can channel through it. You can feel a darkness 
flowing through you, growing with each passing day. You know that there 
is no place for you in the light: You can feel it in your soul. But only
 you can decide if you will embrace this shadow that lies within and 
accept your destiny as one of the children of Khyber . . . or whether 
you resist the call of darkness, and follow the hero's path.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The children of Khyber can follow many different paths, 
and there is no single style of combat that applies to them all. If you 
are a barbarian with the power of <i>fire shield</i>, you'll want to call on your flames and charge into the fray . . . while if you're a rogue with the abilities of <i>charm person </i>and <i>suggestion,</i>
 you'll want to hang back and let others do the fighting. Look for 
synergy between your aberrant powers and the skills of your base class, 
and use these to determine your optimum strategies. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Advancement</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You didn't choose your powers. You never asked to 
manifest an aberrant dragonmark, and you certainly didn't expect it to 
expand further, spreading out across your skin like a cancer. You've 
heard of aberrant dragonmarks, but it has been over a thousand years 
since the world has seen one of such size and power. Only you know what 
it means to you. When your mark grew, did you revel in your newfound 
might? Or were you terrified, worried about what might happen next?</p>
<p align="LEFT">A child of Khyber has no set path of advancement. As 
with combat tactics, everything depends on your original class 
background and on the powers of your mark. Your skills are oriented 
around survival: Those who discover your true nature will fear your 
power, and keen senses and the ability to move unseen in city or the 
wilds may be your only hope in the days to come. Feats such as Hideous 
Strength and Death Curse can further enhance the powers of your 
dragonmark, but if your background is that of a rogue or fighter, you 
may be better off choosing feats that build on those skills. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Resources</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You may never have seen another child of Khyber; your 
aberrant kin are few in number and spread across the world. As a result,
 you have no special resources to draw upon. Children of Khyber often 
feel an instinctive bond with one another, a reflection of your aberrant
 affinity class ability . . . but this doesn't mean that another 
aberrant will risk her life for you. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If your aberrant mark earns you a place in House 
Tarkanan or in a cult of the Dragon Below, you may gain access to 
additional resources. See <i>Sharn: City of Towers </i>for more information on the benefits of associating with House Tarkanan.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Children of Khyber in the World</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"My ancestors put your kind to the sword, warped one. Let me show you what happens when you challenge your betters."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">-- Jaxon d'Cannith, Cannith Sorcerer</p>
<p align="LEFT">Less than four years have passed since the first child 
of Khyber felt his aberrant dragonmark growing and spreading across his 
skin. Whether it is the will of the Dragon Below or some sinister 
after-effect of the Mourning, the spread of aberrant power is a recent 
development. Most children of Khyber choose to conceal their powers and 
keep to the shadows. But one organization is actively searching for 
those who bear aberrant dragonmarks: House Tarkanan.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Daily Life</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Any bloodline can be touched by the aberrant taint. None
 can predict where or when an aberrant mark will manifest . . . and as 
such, none can predict the lifestyle of the aberrant heir. Some become 
wanderers; others turn to lives of crime. A few conceal their marks and 
continue their normal lives, ignoring the whispering voice of Khyber at 
the edge of their thoughts and dreams. </p>
<p align="LEFT">House Tarkanan is a criminal guild with growing 
influence in many of the great cities of Khorvaire. Children of Khyber 
who join House Tarkanan are trained in the use of their aberrant marks 
and also encouraged to develop skills that can serve the guild directly.
 An heir with powers of <i>charm person </i>or <i>suggestion </i>usually becomes a con artist or extortionist, while one with a <i>poison </i>touch
 may be trained as an assassin. The lords of House Tarkanan believe that
 a second War of the Mark is inevitable, and this filters through the 
daily life of house members: Tarkanans learn to see their comrades as 
fellow soldiers in an army and to consider all non-aberrants as 
potential enemies. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Organization </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As a whole, the children of Khyber have no organization.
 They are spread across Khorvaire, and most hide from the light. 
However, House Tarkanan provides a haven and a power base for those 
aberrants it locates. House Tarkanan is organized as a mocking 
reflection of a dragonmarked house. At the bottom it is a criminal 
guild, focusing on the businesses of theft and murder. Above this, the 
"barons" manage regional affairs and coordinate the continuing effort to
 locate and train additional aberrant heirs. Profits from the activities
 of the house are reinvested in additional safehouses and supplies, as 
the leaders prepare for their eventual war. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The current matriarch of House Tarkanan is Thora Tavin 
(LE female human rogue 6/assassin 6/child of Khyber 2). Thora holds 
court in Sharn, but she has a supernatural gift for sensing the presence
 of others with aberrant marks (a variation of the Shield of Siberys 
feat presented in <i>Dragonmarked</i>) and she spends much of her time traveling Khorvaire in search of new recruits.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>NPC Reactions</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">While the power of superstition has faded with time, 
many people are still suspicious of those who bear aberrant marks. This 
is especially strong in smaller communities. In a vast metropolis like 
Sharn, where people deal with harpies, warforged, gargoyles, and ogres, 
an aberrant mark doesn't seem so frightening; but in a small Thranish 
farming village, people still consider the aberrant mark to be the touch
 of darkness. So there is no hard rule, but a child of Khyber may 
receive an unfriendly reaction from those who discover his true nature .
 . . or at least a grudging and suspicious indifference.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some aberrants are coming to the conclusion that they 
should stand together in the face of fear and possible persecution, and a
 child of Khyber has a greater ability to influence those who bear 
aberrant marks. However, this is not enough to ensure a friendly 
reaction from all aberrants; many remain suspicious and indifferent to 
all strangers, even others bearing aberrant dragonmarks. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Children of Khyber in Your Game</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The children of Khyber are few in number and secretive 
by nature, and they should not have a major impact on the daily lives of
 adventurers. However, House Tarkanan could come to be an important ally
 for characters that possess aberrant marks . . . or a dangerous enemy 
of a party working in the service of the dragonmarked houses. An 
individual child of Khyber could be a vicious killer, driven mad by his 
power; a cool and calculating assassin, seeking vengeance against the 
dragonmarked houses for the wrongs done to his ancestors; or a renegade 
unjustly persecuted for the mark she bears on her skin, simply trying to
 survive in a hostile world. And is the resurgence of aberrant power a 
harbinger of a great evil on the rise? Might the dragonmark houses renew
 their persecution of the aberrant heirs? The answers to these questions
 are in your hands. You could choose to simply use House Tarkanan as a 
colorful criminal guild, distinguished by the powers of its members; or 
you could make it the center of a campaign revolving around a renewed 
war between the aberrants and their pure-mark cousins.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adaptation </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you wish to provide children of Khyber with even 
greater versatility, the improved aberrant dragonmark and improved 
lesser aberrant dragonmark class abilities could give a character the 
choice of an additional use of an existing ability or allow him to 
choose an additional ability from the appropriate list, meaning that a 
4th-level child of Khyber could have two aberrant mark abilities, two 
lesser aberrant mark abilities, and one greater aberrant mark ability. 
Because aberrant dragonmark abilities are not thematically linked in the
 same way as the pure marks, this can provide a child of Khyber with 
considerable versatility, so think carefully before incorporating this 
optional rule.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sample Child of Khyber</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Rotting Bal derives his name from the sores that cover 
his skin, an apparent side effect of his powerful aberrant dragonmark. 
Bal was born in the Shadow Marches, in a hidden monastery dedicated to 
the Dragon Below; he learned martial arts at the feet of a dolgaunt 
master. But he always felt a certain distance from the other monks. The 
promises of Xoriat felt empty: Bal was driven by different visions. When
 Thora Tavin came to his monastery, he knew she held the key to his 
destiny. Bal is utterly devoted to Thora and would give his life to 
protect her. With his lethal touch, he is one of the deadliest people in
 Sharn, and he serves House Tarkanan as assassin and enforcer. While he 
is fanatically devoted to the Tarkanan cause and has no compunctions 
about killing, he is no fool; he can be reasoned with and would rather 
avoid unnecessary conflict if possible. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Lesser Aberrant Dragonmark and Greater Aberrant Dragonmark feats can be found in <i>Dragonmarked</i>.
 Death Curse and Hideous Strength will be presented in an upcoming 
Dragonshard, but you can replace them with other feats for now.</p>
