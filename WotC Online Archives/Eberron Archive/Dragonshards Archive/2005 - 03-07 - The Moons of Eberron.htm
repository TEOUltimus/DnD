<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">The sky of Eberron is full of wonders. The Ring of 
Siberys stretches over the equator, its glittering stones standing out 
even in the light of day. Sages trace images of celestial dragon 
patterns of the stars. And twelve moons circle the planet, filling the 
night sky with color and light. </p>
<p align="left">This multitude of moons affects Eberron in many ways. 
While Zarantyr has the greatest influence over the tides of Eberron, 
each moon has its own impact on wind and water, and lunar conjunctions 
can have dramatic effects that can spawn adventures. A confluence of 
moons can pull back the waters, revealing ancient ruins along the shores
 of Xen'drik. Sailors speak of maelstroms that arise when Zarantyr 
eclipses Aryth -- vast whirlpools that can draw a ship into the 
elemental oceans of Lamannia or the endless frozen sea of Risia. The 
sage Galeoin, who lived among the Serens, claimed that the moons 
influenced the tides of magic as well as water and that his barbaric 
hosts had learned to weave lunar power into their arcane rituals; 
however, the magi of the Arcane Congress have yet to find any solid 
evidence supporting Galeoin's claims. A Dungeon Master could certainly 
decide that a particular ritual, magic item, or <i>eldritch machine </i>can
 be completed only during a particular conjunction of moons, or that a 
full moon can enhance the effects of a particular manifest zone. </p>
<p align="left">Each moon has an "ascendant phase" -- a 28-day period 
during which it is unusually bright. To date, scholars have found no 
natural explanation for this phenomenon, and it remains one of the 
mysteries of the skies. This cycle of radiance is the basis for the 
lunar calendar, and each month is named for the moon that is in its 
ascendant phase. Some stargazers claim that the ascendant moon has a 
profound impact on the skills and spirit of children born beneath it; a 
child born in the month of Zarantyr will be wild and mercurial, while a 
child of Therendor will be gentle and kind. Druids and rangers also 
believe that the ascendant moon can be a source of strength -- that a 
child of Dravago has a special gift for calming animals when this moon 
is full in the sky. A Dungeon Master who wants to embrace this idea can 
provide a character with a single action point on a night when his 
ascendant moon is full; this can be used only for an action tied to the 
theme of his moon.</p>
<p align="left">When the dragonmarks appeared, sages were quick to note 
the similarities between the powers of the marks and the mythic 
qualities of the moons. According to popular legend, each dragonmark 
first manifested during the month of its associated moon. One common 
belief is that a child born in the month of his mark has a greater 
chance of developing a powerful dragonmark, and superstitious 
dragonmarked couples often time pregnancies to end in the appropriate 
month. As there were once thirteen dragonmarks, some sages believe that 
there is a thirteenth moon that has either vanished or simply cannot be 
seen with the naked eye, and the existence of such a moon has been 
hinted at by dragons and carvings found in ruined Xen'drik. If this moon
 was once visible in the sky, it vanished long before the rise of human 
civilization, and the common races do not know its name or place in the 
heavens.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Twelve Moons<br></b><b>Zarantyr</b>, <b>the Storm Moon</b><br><b>Color:</b> Pearly white<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Storm<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,250 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 14,300 miles</p>
<p align="left">Zarantyr is the closest moon to Eberron, and it has the 
greatest effect on the planet's tides. Superstition holds that there is a
 far greater chance of being struck by lightning when Zarantyr is full, 
and that bolts can fall from a clear sky. According to the druids, those
 born in the month of Zarantyr have a wild and tempestuous nature. 
Sometimes this translates to aggression, but it can also manifest as 
pure, unbridled energy; barbarians, fighters, sorcerers, and evokers may
 all feel a bond with the Storm Moon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Olarune</b>, <b>The Sentinel</b><br><b>Color:</b> Pale orange<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Sentinel<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 950 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 22,500 miles</p>
<p align="left">To the naked eye, the orange disk of Olarune seems to 
have a slight fringe that vaguely resembles the rim of a shield. The 
druids say that those born when Olarune is ascendant have a strong bond 
to community and to order, and a natural desire to protect others; 
superstition holds that more paladins are born in this month than any 
other. Scattered lycanthropes, especially weretigers, revere Olarune as a
 sort of demigoddess-protector.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Therendor</b>, <b>The Healer's Moon</b><br><b>Color:</b> Pale gray<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Healing<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,100 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 39,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">Therendor is the "brother moon" of Barrakas, sharing a 
similar but narrower orbit with the Lantern Moon. The Serens and druids 
maintain that natural medicines concocted when Therendor is full and 
Barrakas is new are more potent than normal. Those born in the month of 
Therendor are thought to be gentle and empathetic; priests, mediators, 
and healers often have Therendor as their ascendant moon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Eyre, the Anvil<br></b><b>Color:</b> Silver-gray<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Making<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,200 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 52,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">When Eyre is full, a keen-eyed observer can pick out on 
its surface a shadowy shape that vaguely resembles an anvil. According 
to druidic belief, those born under Eyre inherit a solid, practical 
nature and a gift for nature crafts. Some smiths will wait until Eyre is
 full to work on especially difficult projects, and House Cannith 
enclaves often hold celebrations when the Anvil is full in the sky. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Dravago, the Herder's Moon</b><br><b>Color:</b> Pale lavender<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Handling<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 2,000 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 77,500 miles</p>
<p align="left">Large and lavender, Dravago is a striking image in the 
sky. Its orbit typically keeps it at a distance from other moons, and 
old legends say that it is herding the rest and keeping them in motion. 
Children of Dravago are said to be more comfortable with animals and 
plants than with people -- gifted herders, handlers, and farmers, but 
often awkward in social situations. Some say that stones from Dravago 
occasionally fall to Eberron, and alchemists have long claimed that this
 "purple dust of Dravago" holds remarkable magical properties.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nymm, the Crown </b>or <b>King Nymm</b><br><b>Color:</b> Pale yellow<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Hospitality<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 900 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 95,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">The golden disk of Nymm is most typically associated 
with royalty. Those born when Nymm is ascendant are said to be sociable 
and charismatic, gifted orators and con artists. The halflings of House 
Ghallanda frequently offer discounted rates at their hostelries on 
nights when "King Nymm" is in its full moon phase. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Lharvion, the Eye<br></b><b>Color:</b> Dull white with black slit<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Detection<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,350 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 125,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">This moon features a 750-mile-long black chasm, and, 
when viewed from Eberron, the full disk of Lharvion resembles a slitted 
eye. Many superstitions exist about the baleful influence of this moon, 
and strange occurrences and calamities seem to happen when the Eye of 
Lharvion is full in the sky. The druids believe that children of 
Lharvion possess unnatural insights, and gifted diviners and researchers
 are often born in this month.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Barrakas, the Lantern<br></b><b>Color:</b> Pale gray<br><b>Associated Dragonmark:</b> Finding<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,500 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 144,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">Barrakas is the brightest of Eberron's moons, and 
hunters value its light when stalking prey at night. This "sister moon" 
of Therendor shares a similar (if wider) orbit and occasionally seems to
 hide behind her closer brother. On nights when Therendor eclipses 
Barrakas -- "when Barrakas is shy" -- sailors worry about getting lost 
at sea. Those born when Barrakas is ascendant are thought to be gifted 
hunters, but many also believe they have a knack for clarifying things 
that others find confusing. The son of Lharvion sees what others cannot 
see, while the daughter of Barrakas sheds light on that which is already
 in the open.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rhaan</b>, <b>the Book</b><br><b>Color:</b> Pale blue<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Scribing<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 800 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 168,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">The smallest of Eberron's moons, Rhaan looks more like a
 bright star. When viewed with a spyglass, one may see a series of 
ridges that vaguely resemble scribblings on a page. The druids say that 
Rhaan empowers creative thought, and they believe that dancers, 
musicians, poets, and artists of all stripes draw inspiration from the 
Book.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sypheros, the Shadow</b><br><b>Color:</b> Smoky gray<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Shadow<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,200 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 193,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">Sypheros is a dim moon, and people often find it 
difficult to spot in the night sky. Recent observations using powerful 
spyglasses have confirmed that a jagged crack runs down the center of 
the moon, as if the moon is splitting in two. Many believe that children
 born in the month of Sypheros inherit a shifty, untrustworthy nature, 
and parents often seek to time pregnancies to avoid this month. However,
 the druids say that the children of Sypheros are not evil; rather, they
 are comfortable with the shadows and can face them without fear. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Aryth, the Gateway<br></b><b>Color:</b> Orange-red<br><b>Associated Dragonmark:</b> Passage<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,000 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 221,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">The black dragon Vvarrak told the first druids that 
Aryth has a similar effect on manifest zones as Zarantyr has on tides, 
and that particularly weak manifest zones appear only when Aryth is in 
its full moon phase. Some say that those born under this moon are 
restless folk, driven to travel and explore; Lhazaar, who led the first 
great migration from Sarlona to Khorvaire, is said to have been a child 
of Aryth. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Vult, the Warding Moon</b><br><b>Color:</b> Gray and pockmarked<br><b>Associated Dragonmark: </b>Warding<br><b>Approximate Diameter:</b> 1,800 miles<br><b>Approximate Mean Distance from Eberron:</b> 252,000 miles</p>
<p align="left">Vult is the farthest moon from Eberron, and some legends
 say that it holds back forces that lurk out within the stars. The 
druids say that children of Vult are practical, careful folk who 
generally plan ahead and prepare for the worst; when disaster strikes, 
the children of Vult hold civilization together. In his study of the 
Serens, the sage Galeoin reported that the barbarians believe that Vult 
"devours" the spirits of deceased great wyrms that fail to attain 
godhood.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lycanthropes and the Moons of Eberron</b></p>
<p align="left">The full moon has a powerful effect on lycanthropes -- 
and on Eberron, a shapeshifter may have to contend with the influence of
 multiple moons on a single night. A creature afflicted with lycanthropy
 changes involuntarily into animal form whenever one of the twelve moons
 is full. An afflicted creature can resist the involuntary 
transformation with a successful Control Shape check (see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 303); however, for each additional full moon after the first, apply a -2 penalty to the check.</p>
<p align="left">This means that an afflicted lycanthrope has to contend 
with the effects of the curse an average of nineteen nights of the 
month. Thus, rarely does an afflicted lycanthrope last a week before the
 curse takes hold and permanently alters her alignment. </p>
