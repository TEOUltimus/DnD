<p align="left"><i>Sadrian scowled as he watched the archierophant 
conduct the Ritual of Cleansing. He could sense the darkness in her 
soul; like so many of the priests in Sharn, she was filled with ambition
 and greed. But the Council of Cardinals had invested Ythana Morr with 
her position, and he had seen her perform miracles with the power of the
 Flame; it was not the place of a lowly Templar to challenge her faith. </i></p>
<p align="left">Religion plays an important role in Eberron, and future 
Dragonshards will take a closer look at each of the major religions 
found in the world. First it is necessary to understand the role of 
religion and divine magic in the setting, and the ways that the churches
 and clerics of Eberron differ from their counterparts in other 
published worlds. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Nature of the Gods</b></p>
<p align="left">In many <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> settings, deities 
are beings that player characters can interact with directly. There is 
no question whether the gods exist; if you're an experienced planar 
traveler, you can drop by Asgard and beat up Thor. Fundamentally, 
deities are just very powerful characters. </p>
<p align="left">This is not the case in Eberron. While many of the 
deities are portrayed with anthropomorphic icons, they do not walk the 
mortal world or even the known planes. If they exist at all, deities 
inhabit a higher plane of existence -- a realm that cannot be reached 
with <i>planar travel</i>. Some believe that the souls of heroes travel 
to this realm after passing through the darkness of Dolurrh; while this 
is a comforting belief, it has never been proven.</p>
<p align="left">If the gods may not even exist, who do you <i>commune </i>with? Why do <i>planar allies </i>answer your call? Divine magic exists, and most believe that it is a gift from the gods. Something provides answers to <i>commune</i>,
 and a priest believes it to be his deity. A skeptic may counter that it
 is the collective unconscious or merely a powerful outsider. As for <i>planar allies</i>,
 reverence for the gods is not limited to mortals. Celestials and fiends
 also worship deities. An archon dedicated to Dol Arrah may never have 
seen the face of the goddess but it believes in her implicitly, and it 
will aid those mortals who fight in her name. </p>
<p align="left">Ultimately, belief in a deity is a matter of faith. Each
 deity represents an ideal and espouses a certain code and approach to 
life. When you embrace the path of a god, you become part of a community
 in the mortal world. Perhaps, if you are deeply spiritual, you will 
gain the power to perform miracles of divine magic. This is what people 
expect of the gods of Eberron: they affect the world by guiding and 
empowering their followers, not by manifesting and taking direct action.
 </p>
<p align="left"><b>Alignment versus Belief</b></p>
<p align="left">One of the major changes in the <b>Eberron</b><i></i>Campaign
 Setting is that a cleric's alignment does not have to match that of his
 deity. A lawful evil cleric can worship a chaotic good god, and he will
 still receive spells and granted powers. The main question is what this
 divergent alignment means. It may be that the priest is betraying the 
ideals of his church. It is equally possible that the priest fervently 
believes in the principles of his religion but approaches them in an 
unusual manner. For example, an inquisitor of the Silver Flame may be 
lawful evil. He is willing to torture and kill in the interest of what 
he views as "the greater good," and he truly believes that he is 
carrying out the wishes of the Flame when he does so. Good-aligned 
members of the church may find his methods abhorrent, but the question 
is whether his results serve the goals of the church. In the minds of 
the people, questions of good and evil are far broader than "what can be
 detected by <i>detect evil</i>?" When the Silver Flame began its 
crusade against lycanthropy, the soldiers knew that there were 
individual lycanthropes that were not evil. But lycanthropy itself -- a 
curse that could corrupt the body and soul of anyone it touched -- was 
seen as evil, and the sacrifice of innocents was necessary to purge the 
greater darkness. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Pantheistic Clerics and the Cleric with No God</b></p>
<p align="left">One of the predominant religions of Eberron is the 
worship of the Sovereign Host, along with its shadow, the Dark Six. Most
 people worship the entire host and address their prayers to whichever 
deity suits the needs of the moment. A traveler may offer a prayer to 
Kol Korran when boarding a ship, give thanks to Olladra after an 
excellent meal, and make a sacrifice to Dol Dorn when a pirate ship 
appears on the horizon. Priests typically serve a particular sovereign, 
but a cleric can choose to worship the pantheon as a whole. </p>
<p align="left">As described on page 35 of the <b>Eberron</b><i></i>Campaign
 Setting, it is possible for a cleric to have no god and still perform 
divine magic. This is not, however, the same as having no beliefs; it 
still requires a strong commitment to an ideal or a philosophy. The 
cleric needs to devise his own system of belief and explain how it 
justifies the domains he has selected, and the DM always has the 
authority to disallow a combination of domains. The goal is to allow a 
broad range of personal faiths -- like the warforged developing their 
own religions -- not to encourage players to pick domains based solely 
on granted abilities. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Divine Magic in the World</b></p>
<p align="left">Arcane magic is seen as a science. It is a force that 
can be controlled through formula and incantation. Divine magic is quite
 different: it is a miracle of faith. True clerics are rare. They are 
the crusaders of the church, skilled in battle and capable of channeling
 the power of their deity. The vast majority of priests are experts who 
possess no spellcasting ability whatsoever. An average religious expert 
might possess Knowledge (religion), Knowledge (History), Heal, 
Diplomacy, and Sense Motive, and use these skills to provide spiritual 
guidance to her community. Most divine spellcasters are adepts, just as 
most arcane spellcasters are magewrights. A cleric of any level is a 
remarkable figure. </p>
<p align="left">A side effect of this is that most temples do not sell 
divine spells. To begin with, many temples don't have a divine 
spellcaster. Those that do will not sell the gifts of their god for mere
 gold. If the petitioner is a loyal member of the faith, an adept may 
aid him at no cost, or the adept may set a price based on the abilities 
of the adventurer, calling upon him to make a sacrifice to prove his 
faith or perform a service in the name of the church. The more powerful 
the spell, the more significant the sacrifice or service. If a 
nonbeliever serves the cause of the church, it's possible a priest will 
provide assistance, but a temple is not a marketplace. No one can demand
 a miracle as if purchasing a spell from a wizard's guild. Needless to 
say, this makes a character's choice of religion an important decision. A
 cleric of the Blood of Vol will never consider helping a follower of 
the Silver Flame, and you'd be soiling your faith even to ask. </p>
<p align="left">There is a notable exception to this rule: corrupt 
clerics. Especially in Breland, there are priests who are more 
interested in lining their pockets than serving the faithful. If you can
 find such a cleric, you can purchase any spell he can cast, at standard
 prices. </p>
