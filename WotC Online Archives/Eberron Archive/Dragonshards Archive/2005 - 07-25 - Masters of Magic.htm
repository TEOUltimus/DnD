<p align="left">While magewrights and adepts play important roles in the
 world of Eberron, true artificers, wizards, and sorcerers are 
relatively rare -- and high-level characters with these classes are 
rarer still. So when a wizard reaches 17th level, where should she 
expect to find 9th-level spells she can copy? Where do powerful scrolls 
and magic items come from?</p>
<p align="left">A complete list of the mightiest wizards of Eberron 
could fill a book. The dragons of Argonnessen have forgotten more about 
magic than the Twelve have discovered. The dragons shared many of their 
secrets with the giants of Xen'drik, and artifacts exist in the 
shattered land that House Cannith cannot duplicate. The rakshasas have 
an innate gift for magic, and the broken library of Ashtakala holds 
wonders that would amaze the wizards of Aundair. Humanity has produced 
its own legends over the course of history, even if most of these have 
fallen to the passage of time. This article presents a few mighty mages 
-- but this is a foundation for DMs to build upon, nothing more.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mordain the Fleshweaver </b></p>
<p align="left">While the Twelve seeks to advance arcane science, its 
members are expected to abide by codes of ethical conduct. But there 
have always been wizards who believe that any sacrifice can be justified
 in the name of arcane progress. One of these is Mordain d'Phiarlan, now
 known as Mordain the Fleshweaver. As a provost of the Twelve, Mordain 
sought to advance the arts of transmutation in new and terrible ways. He
 delved into the forbidden studies of the Closed Circle of Sharn and 
sought to claim the powers of the daelkyr as his own. The council of the
 Twelve have sealed all records of his work, but people still whisper of
 the horrors found in his workshop when his research was finally 
exposed. Many wonder why he wasn't executed for these crimes; some say 
that his family connections were too powerful, while others suggest that
 the lords of the Twelve still hoped to benefit from his work -- even if
 they couldn't officially condone it.</p>
<p align="left">Whatever the truth, Mordain was excoriated from House 
Phiarlan and banished from the Twelve in 797 YK. Thirty years later, 
rumors arose of a dark tower in the far wastes of western Breland, in 
the region now known as Droaam. Mordain had found a new home, and for 
the last two centuries he has remained in his sinister keep, shunning 
all contact with the outside world. The lands around his tower are 
filled with deadly monsters, and the tales say that these are his 
creations -- and that the horrors within his fortress are far, far 
worse.</p>
<p align="left">Some say that Mordain has formed an alliance with the 
Daughters of Sora Kell, and that they are providing him with knowledge 
and resources in exchange for living weapons. But it is just as likely 
that the hags and the wizard have a simple truce: The hags leave Mordain
 alone, and he keeps his terrors from threatening their rule.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="center"><b>Seven Magical Encounters</b></p>
<p align="left">1. Rakshasas love to gamble. Just after the party has 
found a magic artifact, a rakshasa appears to the group. He can teach 
the group's wizard a powerful spell known only to the fiends -- if they 
are willing to wager the artifact in a game of skill or chance. Of 
course, victory might have long-term consequences: The Lords of Dust 
always look to the long term, and the rakshasa may have a sinister 
reason to place the knowledge in the hands of the heroes!</p>
<p align="left">2. A plague of petrification is slowly spreading across 
western Breland. Is this the work of the Daughters of Sora Kell, or is 
it an ancient weapon from the Xoriat incursion? Either way, the only 
hope of countering this disaster lies in the living citadel of Orlassk, 
which is wandering the caverns deep below Cazhaak Draal.</p>
<p align="left">3. One of the heroes' relatives is afflicted with a 
terrible wasting disease caused by the Mourning, and divine magic has 
proven useless. An oracle says that Mordain the Fleshweaver could undo 
this damage. Can the heroes obtain an audience with the transmuter and 
convince him to aid the ailing heir? What terrible price might Mordain 
ask for his assistance?</p>
<p align="left">4. Exploring an ancient ruin, the party recovers a 
series of scrolls -- lost songs of Jhazaal Dhakaan. If a bard holds onto
 these scrolls, he can learn the new spells when he advances to a 
sufficient level. However, the Dhakaani will be furious to find their 
songs being desecrated by outsiders, and shaarat'khesh assassins are 
sent to silence the bard forever.</p>
<p align="left">5. Traveling through the Mournland, the party encounters
 a village populated by living statues. Each of these stone golems is a 
perfect replica of one of the former inhabitants who were killed in the 
Mourning, in both appearance and memory, but they cannot perceive their 
own condition or that of the ruins around them. Why has Orlassk rebuilt 
this village? Can the inhabitants leave the Mournland, or will they 
revert to inert stone if they try? </p>
<p align="left">6. Mordain is using his magic to lure wizards' familiars
 to his tower, where he transforms them into humanoid creatures and 
sends them back to kill their masters. When a character's familiar 
disappears, can the party rescue her before it's too late?</p>
<p align="left">7. An old woman asks the party to help free her daughter
 -- a young sorcerer who has been become trapped in Dal Quor, the region
 of dreams. The woman is actually Sora Katra -- and her "daughter" is 
Sora Kell herself. After a century in Dal Quor, Sora Kell has learned 
much of the plans of the Dreaming Dark -- but can the party trust the 
hag?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">By now, Mordain should be 438 years old -- well into his
 twilight years. However, a few among the Twelve say that Mordain 
experimented on himself -- that while he is no lich, he has blended the 
blood of dragon and troll in his veins, and is no longer an elf in any 
meaningful sense of the word. Others say that Mordain is a feeble, 
decrepit creature, but that he never allows outsiders to see him -- he 
has an army of organic constructs, and projects his thoughts through 
these vessels. Should a party decide to face Mordain in person, the DM 
needs to decide whether Mordain is himself a monster -- or whether it is
 even possible to meet with the Fleshweaver.</p>
<p align="left">Mordain is an 18th-level elf transmuter specializing in the transformation of living creatures. <i>Polymorph any object</i>, <i>shapechange</i>, <i>clone,</i> and <i>soul bind</i>
 are all in his library, along with a host of lower-level 
transmutations. If a DM wishes to introduce new spells of transformation
 or new types of flesh golems into the game, Mordain is a likely source.
 Mordain can even justify the addition of unusual creatures into the 
world. Do you like abeil, but don't want to explain why they don't have a
 widespread culture? Perhaps Mordain created the first bee-people a year
 ago, and they are just starting to spread beyond his tower. . . . </p>
<p align="left">More information about Mordain can be found on page 167 of the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000">Eberron </a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000"> Campaign Setting</a>.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Sora Kell, the Queen of the Night</b></p>
<p align="left">Along with the rakshasas, the night hags were the first 
children of Khyber, born in the first age of the world. But the night 
hags are far fewer in number, and they are secretive creatures who haunt
 waste and dream. One of the few who has become known in legends is the 
dreadful Sora Kell, mother to the hags of Droaam. Hundreds of legends of
 Sora Kell exist, and many directly contradict one another. In one story
 she seems to be a wizard with epic powers, while in another she 
destroys an army with only her claws. Sora Kell is best known as a 
wanderer, traveling across the world and the myriad planes in search of 
mystical knowledge, which she may take by force or cunning. Some say 
that she is aligned with the Traveler, and a few believe that she IS the
 Traveler -- or at least, that many of the tales of the Traveler 
actually describe the exploits of the hag. Regardless of her personal 
abilities, Sora Kell could be the source of almost any spell or magic 
object; her lairs are hidden across the planes, and most contains racks 
of scrolls and libraries of ancient spells, along with maps of forgotten
 ruins and lore about the mysteries of the multiverse.</p>
<p align="left">Despite the many tales she has spawned, there has been 
no confirmed sighting of Sora Kell for over a century. Perhaps she has 
set a task before her daughters and is content to watch events unfold. 
Maybe she is trapped in another plane or working on a spell that could 
shake the foundations of the world. But whether the hag ever returns, 
her secret troves are hidden across the world, waiting to be found.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Orlassk, the Lord of Stone </b></p>
<p align="left">The daelkyr are creatures of madness. A daelkyr drives 
mundane creatures mad with its presence, and it twists and corrupts 
everything that it touches. But not all daelkyr are alike. The greatest 
of the lords of Xoriat have their own specialties and unique powers.</p>
<p align="left">Orlassk<i></i>is the master of stone. Stories credit 
this daelkyr with the creation of the medusas, basilisks, and all other 
creatures with the power to turn flesh to stone. The medusas of Droaam 
deny having any ties to the daelkyr, and they are not aberrations. But 
the records of the Gatekeepers clearly show that medusas fought on the 
side of the daelkyr in the battle for Cazhaak Draal; whether they were 
creations of Orlassk or simply its slaves is open to debate. Orlassk's 
citadel is said to be formed of living stone -- a giant gargoyle that 
prowls the depths of Khyber.</p>
<p align="left">The daelkyr are creatures of magic. Orlassk is no 
wizard, and it can produce effects or artifacts no wizard could 
duplicate. But a character could learn new secrets of transmutation by 
studying one or Orlassk's workshops or items it has created -- whether 
these are spells like <i>statue</i> or <i>flesh to stone</i>, or entirely new and more terrifying rituals of petrification. The same could be true of other daelkyr: A wizard might learn <i>prying eyes </i>by
 studying the works of the dread Belashyrra, but perhaps she could find 
far worse -- say, a version of the spell whose floating eyes can unleash
 the deadly rays of a beholder!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jhazaal Dhakaan, the Voice of Doom </b></p>
<p align="left">The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan was an agnostic 
civilization with no tradition of wizardry. But magic was still a part 
of goblin society: bardic magic, the songs of the duur'kala. The 
greatest dirge singer in history was Jhazaal Dhakaan, who united the six
 kings and forged the foundation of the empire. It is said that she 
could win the heart of a listener with but a word, or bring down an army
 with a scream. Whatever personal powers she possessed, she crafted many
 powerful artifacts. Jhazaal made the mighty horn <i>Ghaal'duur </i>(<i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> page 272), and this is but one of her legendary creations.</p>
<p align="left">If a Dungeon Master wishes to introduce new bard spells 
into a campaign, the ancient traditions of the Dhakaani are certainly a 
logical way to do it. A bard could attempt to recreate one of the 
ancient songs of Jhazaal. And the dirge singers of Dhakaan are a source 
for magic instruments of all kinds, from <i>horns of blasting </i>to <i>drums of panic.</i></p>
