<p align="left"><i>Daine dived forward as the massive maul came down, 
shattering the flagstone where he'd been standing. The warforged titan 
tried to crush him underfoot, but Daine rolled beneath its legs to come 
up behind the huge construct. His daring maneuver bought him only scant 
seconds of life. The mystic seal would not open until the titan was 
destroyed, and the titan needed to land only one solid blow to shatter 
every bone in Daine's body. There was one other possibility...</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Daine sprinted to the far end of the foundry floor. 
The titan charged after, crushing old bones beneath its massive feet ...
 exactly what Daine had counted on. Daine's dagger was next to useless 
against the vast bulk of the titan, but the adamantine blade could cut 
through steel. As the construct pounded across the chamber, Daine 
inhaled deeply and flung the dagger at the chain net hanging from the 
ceiling. His timing was perfect. The spinning blade severed only four 
strands, but that weakened the net just enough. It tore to pieces as the
 titan passed beneath it, burying the automaton under a hail of steel 
ore. A moment later, the massive gate creaked open. </i></p>
<p align="left">The introduction of the <b>Eberron</b><i> Campaign Setting </i>describes
 the tone as "swashbuckling action and dark adventure." Sounds cool, but
 what does it mean? As an adventurer in Eberron, you still explore 
dungeons and fight monsters, the same as you would in any setting. What 
makes it "swashbuckling action"? </p>
<p align="left">That question has several answers. Action points add a 
cinematic tone to an adventure but action points are a mechanism: it's 
up to the DM and the players to set the tone. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Cinematic Action</b></p>
<p align="left">When setting up a battle, imagine that it's a scene in a
 movie. If other people were actually watching, would they enjoy it? 
Would they hold their breath or fall asleep in their popcorn? In pulp 
action movies, there's much more to combat than:</p>
<p align="left">"I move ten feet and swing at the troll. I rolled an 18."</p>
<p align="left">"You missed. Joe?"</p>
<p align="left">"I got a modified 20." </p>
<p align="left">"That's a hit. How much damage?"</p>
<p align="left">"Six points."</p>
<p align="left">"It's still fighting. It hits you for seven points."</p>
<p align="left">"Ouch." </p>
<p align="left">Think about action scenes in your favorite movies. What can you add, as a DM or player? </p>
<p align="left">The first thing to consider is the environment. Is the 
chamber a perfect square with no furnishings or distinguishing features?
 If not, is there some way you can incorporate the features of the room 
such as furniture, loose flagstones, or tapestries, into your action? 
Why flank the enemy by walking when you could swing a chain, dive 
through a window, or perform a cool tumble. Think about the action you 
are performing -- fighting defensively, using Power Attack, making a 
Rapid Shot -- and ask whether you can add a little color to the 
description. If you were writing a novel or directing a movie, you'd 
never just say, "I increase my AC by 3 points using Combat Expertise." 
You'd need an interesting way to present that information. Describe how 
you weave a wall of steel with your blade, warding off attacks while 
lashing out at your foe.</p>
<p align="left">If a character hits or misses a creature, the DM can use
 the degree of failure to come up with an interesting description. A 
terrible roll may miss completely, but a close one may still draw draw 
blood or rebound off heavy armor plate. </p>
<p align="left">Consider the actions of the opponent; if the target is 
using Dodge or Combat Expertise, work that into the description. "Lord 
ir'Dalin is a skilled swordsman, but he can't match your speed; even as 
he raises his sword into guard position, you drop beneath the parry and 
bury your point between his ribs." </p>
<p align="left">Add color to descriptions of damage, too, based on how 
many hit points the target has left; if Lord ir'Dalin still has 90 hit 
points, that blow should barely nick his chest, but if it drops him to 
single-digit hit points it may have caught him squarely in the ribs. </p>
<p align="left">Of course, there are limits to the amount of energy you 
can put into each scene. When the party fights 20 bandits, you can't 
relate blow-by-blow descriptions of 20 attacks. You can still add a 
little color; instead of saying "he attacks you," try "he growls and 
swings his blade," "he tries to smash your skull with his splintered 
club," or "she sneers and thrusts at you with her rusty sword." If you 
were writing a book instead of playing <b>D&amp;D</b>, how would you 
describe the scene in order to maintain the interest of the reader? What
 makes fighting this group of bandits different from fighting a group of
 disciplined Darguul mercenaries? </p>
<p align="left"><b>Colorful Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">Beyond the use of cinematic description, the 
swashbuckling tone of the setting is enhanced if players sometimes 
perform actions that aren't the most obvious or even the most sensible 
choices. In your next barfight, instead of just pulling out your sword 
and hitting someone, tip the table onto them! Yank the carpet out from 
under someone's feet. Spend a round drinking someone else's ale before 
returning to the fray. Scramble up a rope or tapestry instead of just 
climbing the stairs. </p>
<p align="left">In general, if an improvised action is colorful, fun, 
and does not provide the player with a substantial advantage that he 
couldn't normally get, then he shouldn't be penalized for trying it. If 
there's a rope by the landing and the PC wants to swing down to confront
 the bad guy, that's terrific window dressing. Requiring a skill check 
in that situation would only penalize the player for being impulsive and
 creative. On the other hand, if the player is trying a maneuver that 
will give the PC a considerable advantage over his foe -- allowing him 
to attack from a flank, bypass a trap, avoid an attack of opportunity, 
or something similar -- then calling for a check is appropriate.</p>
<p align="left">A DM can encourage this sort of action by rewarding 
clever, colorful actions with free bonuses. These should not be things 
that the party relies upon receiving; they are gifts the DM grants, not 
rights that the party can demand. If a character comes up with something
 colorful and appropriate that adds to everyone's enjoyment of the 
scene, a DM could consider the following as rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">A +1 bonus to some aspect of the scene, based on the 
nature of the action -- an increase in damage, chance to hit, or 
temporary AC bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">A temporary decrease to the opponent's initiative. This 
is particularly appropriate when tipping a bar table, cutting a tapestry
 off the wall, etc. The action has no serious effect but slows the 
opponent down long enough for other members of the party to act. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">Provide the character with one action point. In most 
cases this can be a temporary action point that must be used before the 
end of the scene. If the player was especially creative, the action 
point could be permanent, as long as no character ever has more than (5 +
 level/2) action points. An action point is a significant (potentially 
life-saving) reward, so reserve it for clever actions that require 
sacrifice or risk from the character. Never, ever allow this type of 
award to be taken for granted. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Depending on the DM's preferred style of play, he may 
create situations where straightforward combat simply cannot win the 
day. In the brief story at the beginning of this article, the hero is 
hopelessly outmatched. The encounter is not meant to be resolved through
 combat. Although it looks like a straightforward fight, it's actually a
 puzzle: the character must fight defensively and stay alive long enough
 to spot the element that he can use to defeat the opponent. In this 
sort of situation, the experience reward for defeating the encounter is 
actually a story reward; the experience is based on the puzzle the 
character needed to solve, not on the CR of the creature itself. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Action Points</b></p>
<p align="left">As mentioned earlier, action points are a tool for 
enhancing combat, allowing anyone to make that critical shot or check 
when it really, really matters. Action points are also a way to draw the
 players into storytelling. The DM should always require players to 
justify their use of action points by describing the enhanced action in 
detail. Consider the player who 99% of the time just declares, "I attack
 the monster and roll an 18." If he wants to use an action point to 
enhance the roll, the DM is perfectly justified to demand a more 
colorful description. What makes this action so spectacular? Does the 
character distract his foe with a cunning move? Does he score a hit 
through dumb luck? Does he shift position so the sun is in his enemy's 
eyes? If the DM wants to hold the game to a high standard, she could 
rule that unless the player comes up with a good story, the action point
 can't be used at all!</p>
<p align="left">The swashbuckling tone of <b>Eberron </b>is in your 
hands as both a player or DM. Action points are one tool to play with, 
but they're only a starting point. Add as much color as you want to your
 combat -- it's impossible to overdo it. The only rule that matters is: 
have fun!</p>
