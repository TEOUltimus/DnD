<p align="right">Shzill Sisics<br> Kobold Wizard</p>
<p align="left">The kobold snatched the last sugar beetle and leapt onto
 his seat. "Daring the feted waters for the Ghaal River, we escaped the 
crumbling tomb to see another day," he barked. Shzill knew it was over 
dramatic, but his small audience gapped at him in rapt awe. He learned 
long ago that bored travelers lavish delicacies on anyone with exciting 
tales to help pass the time. Shzill loved the impromptu patronage almost
 as much as he loved the adventures, and as a member of the Diggers' 
Union, Shzill was full of stories.</p>
<p align="left">Across the isle, Amarand troubled over the map tucked 
discretely among the pages of his Korranberg Chronicle. Whether or not 
it led to anything of value, Matron Marta would demand a good 
explanation why they returned with this document of questionable worth 
rather then the item they were sent to recover especially when they had 
the Khyber dragonshard in their hands and willingly gave it away. "Flint
 and kindling," swore the gnome as he surrendered in his attempt to read
 the enigmatic map. Leaning back, he closed his eyes and listened to 
Shzill's fourth recounting their adventures as a new batch of anxious 
patrons arrive with candied offerings.</p>
<p align="left">Professor Lilla Jorgenvelt of the Dhakaani Studies 
department at Morgrave University had a lead on an important historical 
site in Rhukaan Draal dating back 5,000 years to the collapse of the 
Dhakaani Empire. In addition to its historical worth, the site was 
rumored to house a powerful Khyber dragonshard of immense worth. Lilla 
contacted the Diggers' Union to recover the dragonshard for her, and 
Matron Marta selected a small team of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebmoh/20050718a">resourceful diggers</a>
 who recently came to her attention. The team set out immediately. After
 a perilous journey, they arrived in the Jhollo Ghetto of Rhukann Draal 
were they were to meet Lilla's contact, a warforged named Chopper. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2007-25%20-%20%27Death%20in%20Darguun%27%20Recap_files/moh20050725a1.jpg" alt="The goblin Blue." title="The goblin Blue." border="0" align="right" height="213" width="200">Although
 Jhollo was filled with difficulties common to all exotic travels, the 
team encountered a number of unexpected obstacles placed in their path. 
Another group of adventurers had also learned of the tomb and the 
dragonshard, and they had their own plans for the relic. Reaching Jhollo
 ahead of the diggers, these shady characters disabled Chopper and 
stashed her body in the basement of the mill. Putting a changeling in 
Chopper's place, they intended to lure the diggers to an abandoned 
church where their undead minion lay in wait. Ever perceptive, the 
diggers saw through the changeling's disguise and uncovered the plot to 
hinder them. Towing the changeling, Moll, with them, the diggers revived
 the real Chopper and learned that agents for the Order of the Emerald 
Claw were responsible for their troubles. Determined not to be out done,
 the diggers prepared to enter the ancient tomb.</p>
<p align="left">The tomb of Juulak Vrek was a series of long-buried 
passages and rooms created by the ancient Dhakanni. Magically sealed and
 trapped the tomb itself posed a formidable challenge without the 
additional meddling of the claw. The tomb also featured several bizarre 
magical features. Upon entering the initial chamber, the diggers 
discovered themselves transformed to appear as Dhakaani warriors 
outfitted in the ancient style of that empire. Shzill was horrified that
 he may actually become a hobgoblin, but Amarand seemed to think this 
was merely a way to symbolically prevent the presence of none goblins 
from defiling the tomb. Moving from the entrance chamber to the 
adjoining crypt, the diggers also discovered they could suddenly 
comprehend engravings on the walls and even speak goblin. Amarand saw 
this as further proof of his speculation and as an indication they where
 successfully bypassing the facilities magical defenses.</p>
<p align="left">Defeating undead minions left behind by the Emerald Claw
 and surmounting another series of traps, the diggers happened upon a 
strange goblin. Initially mistaking the diggers as reinforcements for 
the Emerald Claw operatives, the blue tinted goblin unleashed a pair of 
strange creatures to assault the party. Realizing his mistake, Blue 
called off the attack and parlayed with the diggers. An heir of the 
ancient Dhakaani clan, Blue learned of the tomb and dragonshard and 
ventured here to retrieve the relic for his people. Offering the diggers
 a valuable treasure map if they defeat the claw and recover the 
dragonshard for him, Blue won the diggers over to his side. Struggling 
with the fine line between theft and historical preservation, the 
diggers felt they couldn't deny the rightful heirs their heirloom. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2007-25%20-%20%27Death%20in%20Darguun%27%20Recap_files/moh20050725a2.jpg" alt="Shard Chamber." title="Shard Chamber." border="0" align="right" height="338" width="176">Penetrating
 to the heart of the tomb, the diggers discovered the shard chamber. 
Before the pedestal holding the dragonshard stood the agents of the 
Emerald Claw preparing to free the crystal from its resting place. 
Sneaking into the room unnoticed, the diggers surprised their opponents 
and attempted to subdue them. The claw would have none of it a fought 
back with lethal force. Outnumbering their adversaries, Shzill hoped to 
leverage their advantage by also having possession of the shard. 
Skittering to the pedestal, he wrenched it from its resting place.</p>
<p align="left">The tomb shuttered and a powerful wave surged through 
the room. Knocked from their feet, the combatants all looked toward the 
pedestal and Shzill. A second wave wracked the chamber, and a subtle 
trembling began to shaking dust and debris loose. The shaking grew more 
intense until it was difficult for everyone to gain their feet and 
remain standing. Above the rumble, the tomb creaked and groaned. 
Dislodged form the ceiling, a massive stone crashed down on one of the 
Emerald Claw agents. It was time to go!</p>
<p align="left">The flight from the tomb became a running battle with 
the remaining member of the claw. Refusing to forfeit the dragonshard 
with out a fight, the remaining agent pursued the diggers with spell and
 steel. Battling their way back toward the entrance, the diggers soon 
discover that way was block, but there was still hope for escape. It was
 likely a water filled chamber they discovered earlier was feed by the 
Ghaal River and provided a way out. Finally throwing off the last 
opponent, the diggers reached the chamber, plunged into the water, and 
struggled along with the current to emerge banged and bruised in the 
filthy shallows of the Ghaal River.</p>
<p align="left">Spotted by Blue as they struggled to shore, the Diggers 
exchange the shard for the map promised by the goblin. With the tomb 
destroyed and a large section of Jhollo still sinking into the hole 
created by the collapse, the diggers decided it was time to discreetly 
make their way out of Darguun and back to the waiting arms of Matron 
Marta. </p>
<p align="left">As Shzill finished his tale and Wroat's skyline appeared
 over the horizon, Amarand grimaced. Perhaps they should consider 
returning to Jhollo; it might be safer than what lay ahead.</p>
