 your characters finally set foot in Eberron, make sure they're fully 
equipped, armed, and ready for an onslaught of monsters the likes of 
which you've never seen. Of course, you'll also encounter an unending 
wave of more familiar creatures. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In <b>Eberron</b>, your characters could come face-to-face with any and all of the monsters you've encountered or heard about in any other <b>D&amp;D</b> games. (That's because, before anything else, <b>Eberron</b> is a <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> world.) Of course, the reverse is also true: Even if you're not currently playing in <b>Eberron</b>, watch out for any DM toting an <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000">Eberron</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000"> Campaign Setting</a></i> -- the new monsters lurking inside aren't confined to just one world of action and adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While every creature in your existing collection of rulebooks and supplements will have a place somewhere in <b>Eberron,</b>
 some will be particularly at home -- several of the iconic monsters 
(such as beholders, chokers, couatl, doppelgangers, dragons, and so on) 
have specific places (origin, history, homeland, etc.) in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Although the information about integrating those 
"iconic" monsters is an important component of Chapter 12: Monsters, the
 main reason you'll want to flip all the way back there is to get a look
 at the sampling of new monsters lurking across Khorvaire and regions 
beyond -- creatures that will keep characters all over every continent 
of Eberron busy fighting and running for their lives. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>What looked at first like a mound of corpses and 
discarded armament now shifts and moves, eight legs and two massive 
claws emerging from beneath it. Four eyes on stalks snake out from above
 the claws. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The carcass crab is a warped mutation of natural life 
found in the Mournland, and occasionally in Valenar and Darguun. Though 
essentially a giant crustacean, it augments its natural armor by 
attaching the detritus of battle -- bits of armor, weapons, and bodies 
-- to its hard shell with a natural adhesive. This provides both 
protection and camouflage in the wasted battlefields of the Mournland, 
the creature's preferred hunting ground.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Carcass crabs are hardly brilliant or subtle opponents. 
They make minimal use of their camouflage to get close to potential 
prey, then try to grab one opponent and scurry off to make a meal of it.
 It can also hurl poisonous barbs at targets out of claw's reach.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bite (Ex):</b> A carcass crab can make a bite attack 
(attack bonus +13) when it is grappling an opponent, in addition to 
making a single attack with a claw. This bite attack is not subject to 
the usual -4 penalty for attacking with a natural weapon in a grapple. 
The crab must begin its turn grappling to use its bite -- it can't begin
 a grapple and bite in the same turn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex): </b>To use this ability, the carcass crab must hit with a claw attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Barb -- Injury, Fortitude DC 21, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Dex. The save is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adhesive (Ex):</b> A carcass crab uses a natural 
adhesive to attach pieces of armor, weapons, and whole corpses to its 
shell. Typically, this grants the crab an armor bonus of +6 to its AC, 
equivalent to banded mail, but it is possible to find crabs with better 
or worse protection. A crab suffers no armor check penalty from this 
protection. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spiny Defense (Ex):</b> A carcass crab's shell is 
covered with sharp spines that protrude from between attached metal and 
bodies. Combined with spears and swords affixed to its shell, these 
spines offer the crab some protection against attacks. A creature that 
hits a carcass crab with natural weapons or unarmed attacks takes 1d6 
points of piercing damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> *In areas where heaps of corpses and 
discarded weapons and armor are common, including the Mournland, carcass
 crabs gain a +8 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Nothing says "one tough critter" like a huge, poisonous,
 spiny crab covered in the bodies, weapons, and armor of all of the 
other unfortunate characters that went toe-to-pincer with it and 
couldn't finish the job. Aside from the grisly, portable trophy case 
(which could provide all kinds of horribly challenging problems when 
magic weapons, armor, and other stuff get stuck on there), the carcass 
crab is a formidable one-crustacean ambush. With ranged Dex-draining 
poison barb attacks and a frighteningly good grapple attack (imagine 
combing the two), it's got all the basic combat essentials covered. That
 Awesome Blow feat (which you'll find in your <i>Monster Manual</i> on 
page 303) gives the carcass crab the ability to send characters flying 
back ten feet before they land prone, giving them a worm's-eye view of 
their grappled party member growing less and less agile before becoming 
crab chow. The thing that really makes me shudder is to think about what
 combat against one of these critters might be like if a few of the 
bodies stuck to the carapace weren't quite dead (or alive). </p>

<p align="LEFT">This is just one of the species of dinosaur you might 
run into if you explore particular regions of Eberron. As a world that 
never had an ice age, apocalyptic comet incident, or other 
extinction-causing event, Eberron is still home to all of the "terrible 
lizards" you'll find on pages 60 and 61 of your <i>Monster Manual</i>, 
along with a few species you won't -- such as the fastieth dinosaur. 
These domesticated fleet-footed reptiles are to the halflings of the 
Talenta Plains what riding horses are to much of the rest of Eberron. Of
 course, just as with horses, you can also expect to come across packs 
of wild fastieth dinosaurs roaming the wilds of the plains.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This gaunt figure resembles a pale, emaciated 
hobgoblin. It moves with eerie grace despite its blind and empty eye 
sockets. Its skin is covered in a layer of writhing cilia, and a mane of
 longer tendrils surrounds its head. Two long, whiplike tentacles extend
 from its shoulders.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Eberron,
 they captured and transformed many of the world's indigenous creatures 
to create an army of hideous warriors. Bred from hobgoblin stock, 
dolgaunts are cold and efficient killers often placed in command of 
groups of chokers, dolgrims, and other creatures. A dolgaunt is blind 
but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that 
covers its skin. It can also absorb liquids through these tendrils, 
allowing it to drain the vital fluids out of any creature that it 
touches. A dolgaunt is about the same size as a hobgoblin, but far 
leaner and bonier. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Dolgaunts live grim, ascetic lives spent training for 
battle. Forming monastic cells in the depths of Khyber, they 
occasionally perform surface errands for their sinister masters or work 
with the Cults of Dragon Below.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Dolgaunts speak Common and Undercommon. They have also 
developed a mode of communication that uses subtle movements of their 
skin tendrils; this allows a dolgaunt to silently communicate with other
 dolgaunts within 30 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Graceful and deadly, a dolgaunt relies on the reach of 
its tentacles to harm or hinder its enemies. Dolgaunts do not speak in 
combat unless they are issuing commands to underlings. Dolgaunts rarely 
use weapons or armor but may make use of magic belts, bracers, boots, or
 cloaks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vitality Drain (Ex):</b> If a dolgaunt gets a hold of
 an opponent, it can burrow into the flesh of its victim and draw out 
vital fluids using the tendrils that cover its skin. On a successful 
grapple check, the dolgaunt deals 1 point of temporary Constitution 
damage in addition to normal damage. An injured dolgaunt recovers 2 hit 
points every time it successfully uses this ability.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blindsight (Ex): </b>A dolgaunt possesses blindsight 
out to a range of 360 feet; beyond this range, it can discern nothing. A
 dolgaunt's blindsight makes it immune to gaze attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because it is blind, a dolgaunt cannot read or use scrolls.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> *A dolgaunt gains a +4 racial bonus on 
Balance and Climb checks, as its tentacles and the tendrils on its skin 
help it find purchase on almost any substance. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dolgaunt Characters</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Most dolgaunts advance as monks, although a few are 
clerics dedicated to the Cults of the Dragon Below or, in rare cases, to
 one of the Dark Six. The dolgaunt's favored class is monk.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">With ten feet of reach, improved trip, and a 
Constitution-draining attack, these guys are already bad news (nothing 
hurts quite like losing Con in the middle of a fight). Couple that with 
the dolgaunt's damage reduction, and you're in for an unpleasant battle.
 Start tacking on character levels, and these blindsight-using 
aberrations will make you wish your characters had chosen to spend the 
day recovering from wounds, scribing scrolls, training an animal 
companion, and so on. There does seem to be one piece of good news about
 dolgaunts: the special substance that bypasses their DR, a rare metal 
known as byeshk.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" width="95%%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Byeshk:</b> Mined in the Byeshk and Graywall 
Mountains bordering Droaam, this rare metal is prized by smiths for use

enhancement bonus on damage rolls. In addition, byeshk weapons of any 
type are able to bypass the damage reduction of daelkyr, which are 
resistant to all other weapons. The market price modifier of a byeshk 
weapon is +1,500 gp. Byeshk is very difficult to work into armor, and

<p align="LEFT">Among the first warforged created during the Last War, 
titans are a small step forward from massive, mindless war golems. 
Warforged titans are not true living constructs like other warforged; 
they are barely sentient, with just enough intelligence to follow 
changing commands in the heat of battle.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Warforged titans are slow and stupid, but their awesome strength and sheer size makes them fearsome in battle.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Powerful Charge (Ex):</b> Thanks to its Powerful 
Charge feat, a Huge warforged titan deals an extra 3d6 points of damage 
when it charges. A Gargantuan titan deals an extra 4d6 points of damage 
when it charges.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trample (Ex):</b> 2d6+13 points of damage; Reflex half DC 25. The save DC is Strength-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Construct Traits:</b> A warforged titan has immunity 
to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, 
necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, 
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a
 Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is 
not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability 
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but 
it can be repaired.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Very few monsters in Chapter 12 could possibly feel more
 "Eberronian" than the warforged titan. Remnants from the earliest 
experiments that ultimately created the warforged race of living 
constructs, warforged titans are immense, tanklike machines that know 
nothing but battle. (Who knows if they even understand that the Last War
 is over?) They start off with the always-vexing (that is: challenging) 
construct traits, tack on DR 10/adamantine, and then add 10 points of 
resistance against all five energy types. Just punching through the 
defenses of one of these monsters is going to be a challenge in and of 
itself, let alone getting the damage to stick. And that's assuming you 
have the chance to swing a sword or sling a spell. Between its 
impressive move rate of 50, powerful charge, trample ability, fifteen 
feet of reach, <i>and</i> that awesome blow feat, the warforged 
juggernaut almost has to consciously decide to allow a character the 
chance to take a turn in combat just to feel challenged. Gee whiz, these
 things even have +32 on Jump checks -- they can make a standing long 
jump of 15 feet without touching the dice. I can just imagine a 
chasm-side battle with a pair of warforged titans who alternate leaping 
across to an artificer on the far side who's got readied actions to 
repair any damage. Hey, at least they can't take character levels.</p>

types of dragonshards, where they come from, and what they do.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue #319 </b>(that's the May issue, which goes on

creatures spawned by the Last War: the living spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 318 </b>(April) takes a long, hard look at the fourth unique character race created especially for the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting</i>: a sentient race of constructs known as the warforged.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 317 </b>(March) introduces you to three of the unique character races created especially for the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting</i>:
 Changelings, the Kalashtar, and Shifters (with a close look at 
shifters), along with a glimpse at how all the standard character races 
fit into the new world. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 316</b> (February) gives you an idea of how all
 of the standard character classes fit in the setting, introduces you to
 an all-new character class -- the artificer -- and introduces you to 
another of the setting's prestige classes: the master inquisitive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 315 </b>(January) offers more insight into the tone and attitude of the new <b>D&amp;D</b> world, along with a little of Eberron's most recent history. </p>

 Even then, we'll offer up one last "Gearing Up" article to help you get
 an even better idea of what you'll discover inside. In next month's 
final installation of this column, you'll get the chance to pore over a 
map of Khorvaire and discover various facts and details about its many
