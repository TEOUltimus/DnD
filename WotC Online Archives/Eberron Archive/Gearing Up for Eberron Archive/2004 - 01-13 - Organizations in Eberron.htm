<p align="left">Take <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark </i>as a fine example: 
Indiana Jones was a professor at the University of Chicago. He took on a
 dangerous assignment from the U.S. government. During the course of his
 quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant, he faced rival archeologist 
Belloq and the forces of the Third Reich. That's three separate 
organizations and a major NPC foil in just a single adventure. Indy's 
affiliation with the university provides more than enough motivation for
 every one of his escapades. The U.S. government is a great entity for 
introducing new jobs, goals, and motivations. Belloq was very clearly a 
recurring bad guy who was always slipping in to ruin all of Dr. Jones' 
hard work, and if he hadn't exploded at the end of <i>Raiders</i>, he certainly might have sauntered in to snatch up the Holy Grail action in <i>The</i><i>Last Crusade</i>.
 And the Nazis were an ideal evil organization to conflict with Indiana 
Jones -- with plenty of equipment, personnel, and resources, they 
offered many different threats throughout the entire <i>Raiders </i>adventure and resurfaced once more with and entirely different array of challenges for <i>The Last Crusade</i>. </p>
<p align="left">When you start flipping through your copy of the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>,
 you'll discover an entire chapter dedicated to but a few of the 
organizations you may encounter in your campaign. One of the more heroic
 groups your characters could ally with (or at least be employed by) is 
the Church of the Silver Flame. Of course, just as you'd find in any 
organization in the real world, not every member of the Church of the 
Silver Flame has the same alignment. So, you could just as easily find 
your heroic party confronted by radical members of the church. 
Unexpected allies and intriguing enemies can be found in every 
organization.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#999999" width="550" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Church of the Silver Flame</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The priests and paladins of the Silver Flame have 
battled the forces of darkness for hundreds of years. While it is a 
relatively young religion, it has found staunch support across 
Khorvaire, especially in the kingdom of Thrane. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Brief History</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The Church of the Silver Flame was born in 299 YK. A 
massive and unexpected volcanic eruption in Thrane released a demon lord
 and its minions, and for a time it seemed that darkness would cover the
 land. But the upheaval had also opened a path to the force that had 
bound the demons for an aeon. This silver flame found a vessel in a 
young woman named Tira Miron; empowered and inspired, Tira rallied the 
forces of Thrane and drove the fiends back to the black mountain, 
sealing them in the vaults of Khyber once more. But Tira's work was not 
done. Traveling to the cavern where the flame rose from the earth, she 
allowed her body to be consumed so that her soul could join with the 
flame itself. Tira now serves as the Voice of the Silver Flame, the 
intermediary between humanity and the divine.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Over the centuries the Church of the Silver Flame has 
spread across Khorvaire. Its followers are engaged in a never-ending 
struggle against the forces of evil. They have fought demons, hunted the
 lycanthropes almost to extinction, and battled all manner of monsters. 
But all too often, it is human corruption that proves the most dangerous
 foe. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Organization</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Headquarters:</b> Flamekeep, Thrane<br><b>Leader: </b>Jaela Daran, the Keeper of the Flame<br><b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Good<br><b>Secrecy:</b> None<br><b>Symbol:</b> The symbol of the Church is a silver arrowhead engraved with a stylized flame. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hierarchy</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Church of the Silver Flame is divided into the 
church militant and the church ministry. The ministry oversees the 
administrative functions of the church. The members of the ministry are 
also responsible for providing spiritual guidance to the followers of 
the church. They are shepherds rather than soldiers, and they battle 
evil by nurturing good. Each kingdom is overseen by a network of priests
 and bishops; this chain of command continues up to the Council of 
Flamekeep and the Keeper of the Flame. The current Keeper is a girl 
named Jaela Daran, who was appointed in 995 YK .</p>
<p align="LEFT">The church militant is comprised of warriors, paladins, 
clerics, and exorcists. Where the ministry attempts to kindle a spark of
 good in the human spirit, the church militant battles the forces of 
evil wherever they appear. Members of this spiritual army live ascetic 
lives in monastic fortresses, alternating periods of devotion and 
training with circular patrols across the territory protected by the 
Flame. The church militant has its own internal hierarchy, but it is 
under the rule of the Keeper of the Flame, and the rank and file of the 
army are expected to defer to the ministry. The church militant is the 
sword of the Flame; the ministry is the mind that guides it. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Within both the ministry and the church militant, a 
promising initiate is often sent on an extended and unstructured 
pilgrimage, charged to discover the true nature of good and evil by 
walking in the world and to try to make a difference as an individual. 
These pilgrims are expected to respond to the needs of the church in the
 communities they pass through. Any PC cleric or paladin who wishes to 
be a member of the Church of the Silver Flame should usually be 
considered a pilgrim. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Motivation and Goals</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Church of the Silver Flame seeks to purify the 
world. Its most obvious work is its war against supernatural evil; 
members of the church militant roam the land fighting fiends, undead, 
and magical beasts. But the church also seeks to fight corruption, 
greed, and other human evils. The common layman is not expected to fight
 zombies and ghouls; this is the work of the soldiers of the church. But
 he is expected to live a noble life and to encourage others to do the 
same. It is said that those who purify their spirits in this life will 
join with the Silver Flame after death, strengthening the flame as it 
binds the forces of evil within Khyber.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sadly, the priests and parishioners of the church don't 
always live up to these noble standards. Within Thrane, the warriors and
 ministers of the Silver Flame are generally dedicated to the ideals of 
the church -- sometimes with an almost frightening zealotry. But the 
further away one gets from Flamekeep and the watchful eye of the Keeper 
of the Flame, the more common it is to find corrupt ministers and 
warriors who abuse their reputation for personal gain. Southern Breland 
is particularly infamous for the conduct of its ministers. Periodically,
 the Council of Flamekeep sends agents to seek out and eliminate 
corruption within the church -- but the foul often find shelter in the 
shadows. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Allies</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Silver Flame has close ties to the Knights of 
Thrane. Most of the knights are devotees of the Silver Flame, but they 
have chosen to serve the crown instead of taking up the monastical rule 
of the church militant. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Enemies</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The greatest enemies of the Silver Flame are the Lords 
of Dust. Though few even within the ministry are aware of it, the Silver
 Flame was born in the ancient struggle between the rakshasas and the 
couatl, and it is the power of the Silver Flame that holds the rajahs at
 bay. The Lords of Dust rarely move openly, but over the centuries there
 have been many clashes between the agents of the flame and this 
alliance of fiends. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A second deadly rival is the Order of the Emerald Claw. 
The church militant will take any opportunity to strike down these 
necromancers and their vile creations -- a situation that may exacerbate
 tensions between Thrane and Karrn'ath, where the Order has been gaining
 support. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Notable NPCs</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jaela Daran</b> (LG female human Clr16) is a 
nine-year old girl who was called to serve as the spiritual leader of 
the Church of the Silver Flame. She has a streak of pure silver in her 
hair, a sign of the touch of the divine. She is disturbingly intelligent
 and charismatic; while her body is that of a little girl, she speaks 
with the voice of all of the Keepers of the Flame who have come before 
her. </p>
<p align="LEFT">While Jaela is one of the most powerful clerics in 
Khorvaire, she is bound to the flame and cannot venture far from it. She
 is not a hero, but she has been empowered to recognize and guide 
heroes, and adventurers may be summoned to Flamekeep to receive messages
 from the Flame. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Opportunities</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Any PC who chooses to play a paladin or cleric devoted 
to the Silver Flame has a tie to the church. A fighter or wizard with 
strong religious beliefs could also choose to join the church militant. 
In most cases these characters should be pilgrims -- freed from the 
strict hierarchy of the church. As a pilgrim, a character will be 
treated respectfully by others of the faith, but does not have access to
 the resources of the church; the purpose of his journey is to learn 
about the world on his own. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Church of the Silver Flame can serve as a valuable 
ally to good-aligned parties. It is engaged in an endless battle against
 evil, and while the church militant has many warriors, few have the 
potential of player characters. If they chose, PCs who align with the 
Silver Flame can become champions of the church. However, there are a 
number of limitations to consider when using the church as a patron. 
First, good contacts with the church does not automatically equal free 
healing magic. In small towns or smaller communities, the priest of the 
Silver Flame may simply be an expert with ranks in Healing, Sense 
Motive, Knowledge (religion), and Diplomacy -- but no actual magical 
powers. Even in larger cities, members of the ministry are more likely 
to be adepts than full clerics. Clerics are rare and exalted, and are 
usually tied to the church militant, serving on the front lines of the 
war against evil. While most priests know mundane healing techniques, 
House Jorasco is the center for magical healing. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Another limitation is the high moral standards of the 
church. Normal parishioners are not expected to behave as paladins. But 
the Silver Flame sees the world in black and white, and when dealing 
with the church of Thrane, PCs will be expected to act as heroes. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But then there is the final issue: The fact that not all
 priests live up to these standards. Characters who appeal to the church
 for aid may find that the local priest cares little about their 
problems. In fact, a truly noble pilgrim or champion might actually 
become the target of treachery, if a corrupt priest sees the character 
as a threat to his position. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventure Ideas</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In any PC is a cleric or paladin in the service of the 
Silver Flame, the church presents an easy way to draw the characters 
into a conflict; a local priest calls on the passing pilgrims to 
overcome an evil that has arisen within the area. Corrupt priests also 
present opportunities for adventure, as the heroes realize that the work
 they have been doing for the church has only benefited the priest. How 
far does the corruption go? If the heroes try to expose the priest, will
 they simply endanger themselves further?</p>
<p align="LEFT">At higher levels, characters may be directly summoned by
 the Keeper of the Flame. Jaela may have seen the destiny of the 
characters in the flame itself; this could be the start of a major 
campaign arc, as she equips them with relics of the church and sends 
them on a task that only they can accomplish. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Note that followers of the flame may receive a cold 
welcome from monstrous communities. Droaam and Darguun have both 
suffered at the hands of the Silver Flame -- and pilgrims who pass 
through these regions would be well advised to be prepared for treachery
 and aggression. </p>

<p align="LEFT">If your character of adventuring group finds itself 
closely tied to the goals and purposes of the Church of the Silver 
Flame, you might be drawn to serve as a champion in its endless battle 
against demons, devils, and other evil outsiders -- to take on the 
prestige class mantle of an Exorcist of the Silver Flame.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#999999" width="550" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Exorcist of the Silver Flame</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The church of the Silver Flame is dedicated to fighting 
supernatural forces of evil across Khorvaire. Trying to remain above the
 lingering conflicts of the Last War, the church focuses its energy on 
combating extraplanar threats such as possessing devils and corrupting 
demons. Leading this unceasing war are the exorcists of the Silver 
Flame, spiritual heroes who channel the power of the Silver Flame to 
ward off evil outsiders, cast out possessing spirits, and smite the 
material forms of the forces of evil.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Exorcists of the Silver Flame are drawn from the ranks 
of the most experienced and dedicated champions of the church, primarily
 clerics and high-level paladins. Multiclass cleric/wizards (and 
accomplished mystic theurges of the church) are also drawn to the class,
 though most of these retain their emphasis on divine spells and powers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most exorcists of the Silver Flame are active in the 
world, out on the front lines of the war against evil. A few NPC 
exorcists might be found in a state of retirement -- so physically and 
emotionally scarred from their experiences that they border on insanity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hit Die:</b> d8.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Requirements</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">To qualify to become an exorcist of the Silver Flame, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alignment:</b> Any good.<br><b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +3.<br><b>Skills:</b> Knowledge (the planes) 3 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.<br><b>Spells:</b> Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Skills</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The exorcist of the Silver Flame's class skills (and the
 key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), 
Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) 
(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis) 
and Spellcraft (Int). </p>
<p align="LEFT"> Skill Points per Level: 2 + Int modifier.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Class Features</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">All of the following are class features of the exorcist of the Silver Flame.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Exorcists of the Silver Flame gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spells per Day: </b>From 2nd level on, when a new 
exorcist of the Silver Flame level is gained, the character gains new 
spells per day as if she had also gained a cleric or paladin level. She 
does not, however, gain any other benefit a character that class would 
have gained (improved ability to turn undead and so on). This 
essentially means that she adds these exorcist of the Silver Flame 
levels to her levels in cleric or paladin, then determines spells per 
day and caster level accordingly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a character had levels in both cleric and paladin 
before she became an exorcist of the Silver Flame, she must decide to 
which class she adds each level of exorcist for the purpose of 
determining spells per day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Flame of Censure (Su): </b>An exorcist of the Silver 
Flame can manifest the mystical power of the Silver Flame to ward off 
outsiders with the evil subtype. The exorcist makes a Charisma check and
 consults Table 8-9 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, using his total 
character level to determine the most powerful outsider he can affect. 
He then rolls 2d6 + his level in this class + his Charisma modifier for 
turning damage. Using both his character level and class level in this 
manner means that he is more likely to affect a single, powerful 
outsider, but unlikely to censure more than one of them. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A censured outsider is stunned for 1 round by the power 
of the Silver Flame channeled through the exorcist. If the exorcist's 
character level is at least twice the outsiders' Hit Dice, he banishes 
the outsider back to its home plane. An exorcist can use this ability a 
number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of the Exorcist (Su):</b> An exorcist of the 
Silver Flame chooses a weapon with which he will dispense the will of 
the church. The chosen weapon must be a weapon that the exorcist of the 
Silver Flame is proficient in, and must have been in his possession for 
the last 24 hours. While wielding this weapon, the exorcist has +1 
sacred bonus to damage and the weapon is considered magical for purposes
 of penetrating damage reduction.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An exorcist of the Silver Flame may only have one weapon of the exorcist at a time.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of Silver (Su):</b> Starting at 2nd level, the
 exorcist of the Silver Flame's chosen weapon is now considered silver 
as well as magical for the purposes of penetrating damage reduction, 
while he wields it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Darkvision (Ex):</b> If he does not already have it, 
an exorcist of the Silver Flame gains darkvision 30 feet at 3rd level. 
His darkvision is increased to 60 feet at 6th level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Resist Possession (Su):</b> At 3rd level, an exorcist of the Silver Flame receives a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against possession, including <i>magic jar</i>
 spells, ghostly malevolence, and fiendish possession. He also receives a
 +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against all charm and compulsion 
spells and effects cast by evil outsiders or undead.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Smite Evil (Su):</b> Starting at 3rd level, once per 
day an exorcist of the Silver Flame may attempt to smite evil with one 
normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack 
roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per exorcist level. If the 
exorcist accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has 
no effect but the ability is still used up for that day. An exorcist who
 is also a paladin and/or cleric adds his daily uses of this ability 
from each class together, and adds his exorcist level to his paladin 
level and/or cleric level to determine bonus damage. For example, a 
5th-level cleric/10th-level paladin/3rd-level exorcist of the Silver 
Flame can smite evil 4 times per day (3/day from his paladin levels and 
1/day from his exorcist levels) and deals +18 points of damage on a 
successful smite.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At 7th level, the exorcist may smite evil one additional time per day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Detect Thoughts</i> (Sp):</b> At will, an exorcist of the Silver Flame can use <i>detect thoughts,</i> as the spell. The DC is 10 + class level + Charisma modifier.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of Good (Su):</b> Starting at 4th level, the 
exorcist of the Silver Flame's chosen weapon is now considered good as 
well as silver and magic for the purposes of penetrating damage 
reduction, while he wields it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Burning Exorcism (Su):</b> At 5th level, an exorcist 
of the Silver Flame gains a +2 bonus on Charisma checks to force 
possessing spirits out of the bodies they inhabit, as well as on all 
dispel checks and caster level checks to harm, banish, or overcome the 
spell resistance of evil outsiders. This includes dispel checks to 
dispel a <i>summon monster </i>spell when the summoned monster is an evil outsider. However, the bodies they inhabit take 1d6 damage (half sacred, half fire). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of Flame (Su):</b> Starting at 6th level, the exorcist of the Silver Flame's chosen weapon deals an additional 1d6 fire damage while he wields it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of Law (Su):</b> Starting at 8th level, the 
exorcist of the Silver Flame's chosen weapon is now considered lawful as
 well as good, silver, and magic for the purposes of penetrating damage 
reduction, while he wields it. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of Sacred Flame (Su):</b> Starting at 9th 
level, the exorcist of the Silver Flame's chosen weapon deals an 
additional 1d6 sacred damage while he wields it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Warding Flame<i></i>(Su):</b> At 10th level, an 
exorcist of the Silver Flame, at will as a free action, can bath himself
 in silver flame. As long as the warding flame covers him, he gains a +2
 sacred bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws. In addition, he gains 
spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil 
creatures.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Any evil creature that makes a successful melee attack 
against the exorcist of the Silver Flame while he is bathed in the 
warding flame must make a fortitude save or be blinded (as per <i>blindness/deafness</i> spell, with a DC 20 + the exorcist's Charisma modifier.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">The warding flame also provides bright illumination up 
to 30 feet from the exorcist and shadowy illumination up to 60 feet. The
 warding flame can be dismissed at any time.</p>
