 many of you will be contemplating the creation of a new campaign that 
incorporates the new psionics rules. Others will be sorting through how 
best to add psionics to your existing game. And some will elect to not 
use psionics in their game at all. </p>
<p align="LEFT">When the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000">Eberron</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000"> Campaign Setting</a></i>
 comes out in June, you might find yourself facing the same kind of 
decisions -- whether you want to use psionics in your game and, if so, 
to what extent. One of the interesting bits about the world of Eberron 
is that the campaign setting was designed with those decisions in mind. 
That is, the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> was created with the
 use of psionics in mind, along with various options that would allow 
you to adjust the amount of psionics in your campaign to suit your 
particular needs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the very baseline level of including psionics in your
 game, you have an entirely new character race to choose from -- one 
that manifests psionic power as a racial ability: the kalashtar.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#999999" width="550" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Kalashtar</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2004-13%20-%20Mind%20Games%20in%20Eberron_files/eb_kalashtar_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="347" width="200">The
 kalashtar are a compound race: incorporeal entities from the alien 
plane of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams, merged with human bodies and 
spirits to form a distinct species. They were once a minority among the 
quori, the native race of Dal Quor, hunted and persecuted for their 
religious beliefs. Fifteen thousand years after the quori invaded 
Eberron and the connection between their plane and the Material Plane 
was severed, the kalashtar were the first of the quori to discover a 
means to reach the Material Plane once more. Fleeing persecution, they 
transformed their physical forms into psychic projections that allowed 
them to enter the Material Plane and merge in a willing partnership with
 humans. It took centuries for the other quori to discover a similar 
means to psychically project their spirits out of Dal Quor to possess 
human bodies, forming the Inspired, while leaving their own bodies 
behind -- much as mortals project their minds to Dal Quor when they 
dream. For five thousand years now, the Inspired in their vast kingdom 
of Riedra have continued to persecute and oppress the kalashtar.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Personality: </b>As a true merge of human hosts and 
quori spirits, the kalashtar possess keen intellects, but are not ruled 
by logic. They seek the perfection of their minds and spirits, often to 
the exclusion of any physical pursuits. They are generally warm and 
compassionate, but their manners and ways of thinking are alien to the 
native races of Eberron. They are more interested in psionics than in 
the magic that pervades Khorvaire, and often lace their discourse with 
esoteric terms such as <i>matter, kinetics,</i> and <i>ectoplasm.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The kalashtar are outcasts from their home plane and can
 never return there -- not even in dream. The combination of life in 
exile and a dreamless existence makes the kalashtar slightly inclined 
toward madness, and some have speculated that the kalashtar devote 
themselves to psychic and physical discipline in order to keep 
themselves safely sane.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Physical Description: </b>The kalashtar appear very 
similar to humans, but have a grace and elegance that makes them appear 
almost too beautiful. They are slightly taller than the average human, 
and their faces have a slight angularity that sets them apart from the 
human norm, but their deviation from average only makes them seem more 
attractive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Relations: </b>The kalashtar are born diplomats and 
relate fairly well to members of all races -- except, of course, the 
Inspired. They relate best to humans, with whom they share the greatest 
physical similarity, but some kalashtar find themselves strongly drawn 
to other races instead. They oppose the Inspired in all ways, both 
within Riedra and beyond its borders, and likewise oppose any group or 
force that corrupts or degrades mortal souls.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alignment: </b>The kalashtar are generally lawful 
good. They combine a sense of self-discipline that borders on the 
ascetic with a genuine concern for the welfare of all living things, or 
at least their souls.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kalashtar Lands: </b>The kalashtar homeland is a 
region of Sarlona called Adar, a land of forbidding mountains and hidden
 fortresses in the southeastern portion of the continent. Even in Adar 
their numbers are small, and the number of kalashtar found in Khorvaire 
is much smaller still. However, they can be found in the largest human 
cities. The largest kalashtar population in Khorvaire is in the city of 
Sharn, because of its proximity to Xen'drik, where many of the Inspired 
have extended their reach.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dragonmarks:</b> The kalashtar never possess dragonmarks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Religion: </b>The kalashtar do not follow gods, but 
have their own religion called the Path of Light. The center of this 
belief system is a universal force of positive energy the kalashtar call
 <i>il-Yannah,</i> or "the Great Light." Through meditation and 
communion with this force, the kalashtar seek to strengthen their bodies
 and minds for the struggle against the forces of darkness that threaten
 all life on Eberron. Though <i>il-Yannah</i> is not a deity, a few 
clerics draw power from the Path of Light. A greater number of devout 
followers of the Path are psions and psychic warriors.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Language: </b>The kalashtar speak Quor, the language 
of the quori, and the common tongue of their homeland (either Common in 
Khorvaire or Riedran in Adar). Quor is a hissing, guttural tongue more 
suited to the alien forms of the quori than their humanoid hosts. It has
 its own written form, a flowing, elegant script with many circular 
letters.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Names: </b>Kalashtar names have much in common with 
the name of their people: they are three to five syllables long, with a 
combination of hard and hissing consonants. Male names end with one of 
the masculine name suffixes -harath, -khad, -melk, or -tash. Female 
names use the feminine suffixes -kashtai, -shana, -tari, or -vakri.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Male Names:</b> Halkhad, Kanatash, Lanamelk, Minharath, Nevitash, Parmelk, Thakakhad, Thinharath.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Female Names:</b> Ganitari, Khashana, Lakashtari, Mevakri, Novakri, Panitari, Thakashtai, Thatari.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adventurers: </b>Every kalashtar enters adulthood 
with a fundamental choice: try to live a normal life as a persecuted 
exile in Adar, or take up a more active role in combating the Inspired 
in the world. Unsurprisingly, many kalashtar choose the latter option 
and live a life at least bordering on adventure. Most kalashtar 
adventurers are motivated primarily by their hatred of the Inspired, but
 a few -- primarily those advanced along the Path of Light -- are driven
 by their compassion for all living beings and their desire to fight 
darkness in whatever form it takes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kalashtar Racial Traits</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Medium:</b> As Medium creatures, kalashtar have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kalashtar base land speed</b> is 30 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and effects, and possession:</b> The kalashtar's dual spirits help them resist spells that target their minds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>+2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks: </b>The kalashtar are masters of social interaction, influencing others through their commanding presence and subtle psychic powers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>+2 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate a human:</b> Kalashtar have a close physical resemblance to humans.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Immunity to the <i>dream</i> and <i>nightmare</i> spells, as well as any other effect that relies on the character dreaming:</b> The kalashtar do not dream.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Naturally Psionic:</b> Kalashtar gain 1 extra power point per character level, regardless of whether they choose a psionic class.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Psi-like Abilities: </b><i>Mindlink </i>(1/day)<i>. </i>This ability is like the power manifested by a wilder of 1/2 the kalashtar's Hit Dice (minimum 1st level).</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you are not using the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> in your game, use this description of the <i>mindlink</i> power:</p>
<p align="LEFT">You forge a telepathic bond with another creature within
 30 feet, which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. The bond
 can be established only with a willing subject, who therefore receives 
no saving throw and gains no benefit from spell resistance. You can 
communicate telepathically through the bond even if you do not share a 
common language. No special power or influence is established as a 
result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance 
(although not from one plane to another), but only lasts for 1 round per
 character level. This is a mind-affecting spell-like ability.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Automatic Languages:</b> Common and Quor. Bonus Languages: Draconic and Riedran.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Favored Class: </b>Psion. A multiclass kalashtar's 
psion class does not count when determining whether he takes an 
experience point penalty for multiclassing.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">So, just starting out with a kalashtar character gives your campaign a little taste of psionics, but not too much. The <i>mindlink </i>power
 is very cool, but if you think about it, it's not necessarily any more 
useful than, say, darkvision or an extra feat and skill point per level.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adding more psionics to your game is as easy as allowing
 characters access to the psionic classes, feats, and prestige classes 
you'll find in the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook.</i> (Players can look forward to running into some psionic NPCs and monsters too.) </p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, if you don't want psionics in your Eberron 
campaign, it's as simple as just making the decision. The campaign 
setting was designed to allow you to do just that -- the continent of 
Sarlona can simply be a place that people (and monsters) don't come from
 and your characters don't visit. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Even if you start out with a campaign that doesn't use 
psionics, there's always the option of adding them in later. The good 
bit about the Eberron Campaign Setting is that it's easy to turn that 
dimmer switch from "off" to "dim" to "bright" with very little effort. A
 few immigrant kalashtar PCs and/or NPCs might be the first to bring 
psionics to the continent of Khorvaire. Your adventuring party might 
just encounter some alien creatures with powers that defy explanation. A
 wayward voyage on an elemental galleon could land your adventuring 
party on the shores of Sarlona. You could even decide to incorporate the
 idea of a psionic secret society that's been around for ages, 
infiltrating every corner of the world, and always working from the 
shadows -- a group that may have never been detected until the PCs 
discover their existence or become targeted by them. One such group is 
the very evil organization known as the Dreaming Dark.</p>
<table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="#999999" width="550" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Dreaming Dark</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Dreaming Dark is an order of psychic spies and 
assassins -- the hidden eyes and hands of Dal Quor, the Region of 
Dreams. While it generally seems to be allied with the Inspired lords of
 Riedra, the goals of the Dreaming Dark are subtle and mysterious -- but
 always deadly. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Brief History</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">For a thousand years Riedra has been an insular land of 
mystery. The Inspired wear secrecy like a shroud, and foreigners are not
 allowed into the lands of the empire. For much of the history of 
Riedra, there was no contact between the Inspired and the other 
inhabitants of Eberron, but in recent decades this wall has been 
lowered; outsiders are not allowed on Riedran soil, but Inspired 
ambassadors can be found in most of the courts of Khorvaire. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But while the Inspired have only recently established 
open political contact with Khorvaire, they have long maintained a 
network of spies stretching across Eberron. This force is known as the 
Dreaming Dark, and for centuries it has simply watched the world from 
the shadows while the Inspired built their power within Riedra. But now 
the Quori are ready to act, and the Dreaming Dark are their hands. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Organization</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Headquarters:</b> Dar Jin, Riedra<br><b>Leader: </b>The Devourer of Dreams<br><b>Religion:</b> The Dreaming Dark<br><b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Evil<br><b>Secrecy:</b> High<br><b>Symbol:</b>
 An eye partially concealed under a wing. When this is used as a badge 
of office, the style of the eye indicates the rank and position of the 
bearer. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hierarchy</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Should he ever be confronted with the actions of the 
Dreaming Dark, a Riedran ambassador would deny that his nation had 
anything to do with the organization. This is actually true. The lords 
of Riedra are charged to maintain and administer the Quori territory on 
Eberron. The Dreaming Dark is an entirely separate organization whose 
rulers dwell in Dal Quor itself. The Dreaming Dark provides information 
to the Riedran court, but the rulers of Riedra have no actual authority 
over the agents of the Dark; in fact, a thoughtstealer usually holds a 
higher place in the hierarchy of Dal Quor than a Riedran governor or 
general. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The vast majority of agents of the Dreaming Dark are 
Inspired -- vessels for the Quori spirits of the Region of Dreams. Some 
of these agents use Disguise or <i>skins of the shadowed self</i> to 
blend in with the local population; others pose as kalashtar. But the 
Dreaming Dark has another weapon in its arsenal -- the insidious psionic
 discipline known as <i>mind seed</i>. Using this technique, a powerful 
psion can actually replace the personality of another humanoid creature 
with its own thoughts and beliefs, even imparting a share of its his 
psionic powers. Over the centuries, the Dreaming Dark has used this 
power to gain agents across Eberron, even in security-conscious nations 
like Zilargo, Aerenal, and Argonnessen. These agents are referred to as 
"shadows', being both weaker reflections of the original and aspects of 
the Dark. The Dreaming Dark makes limited use of shadows; these agents 
do not actually possess true quori spirits, and there have been a few 
cases where a shadow turned against the Dark. Shadows typically observe 
and gather information, but over the centuries they have also built 
fifth columns within their nations. As a result, the Dreaming Dark has 
influence over criminal organizations, trade guilds, and academic 
institutions; it even has agents in dragonmarked houses and courts 
across the world. Some of these groups have no idea that they are 
serving the Quori; they are simply following a leader without realizing 
that his soul has been compromised. But there are people who have been 
raised in shadow families. They do not inherit any sort of psionic 
abilities, but they are taught to revere the Quori; they believe that if
 they serve faithfully they will one day be granted the status and power
 of a shadow. These agents know virtually nothing about the Dreaming 
Dark; they simply follow the commands of their elders or their shadow 
contact. </p>
<p align="LEFT">There are a number of basic levels within the Dreaming 
Dark. The shadows are at the bottom of the hierarchy; they generally 
serve as passive spies or coordinate the actions of the fifth columns. 
Above the shadows are the field agents of the Dark. These typically fall
 into one of three categories:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Thoughtstealers</b> are the eyes of the Dark. Psions 
specializing in telepathy and clairsentience, they can read secrets in 
the minds and auras of others. Thoughtstealer hosts are usually trained 
as rogues or monks. A few thoughtstealers become Quori nightmares, using
 the powers of the nightmare to read the dreams of their opponents. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dominators</b> are trained to manipulate minds and 
events, use psionic power and natural guile. Their psionic powers are 
focused on controlling thoughts, and while their hosts are usually 
trained as rogues the emphasis is on Charisma based skills. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dreamblades </b>are the assassins of the Dreaming 
Dark. The Quori prefer to use manipulation as opposed to force, but when
 bloodshed is the only answer the dreamblades are ruthless and deadly. 
Dreamblades are typically psychic warriors as opposed to psions; the 
most skilled are Quori nightmares or soulknives. Hosts are trained as 
fighters, monks, or rogues. The Dark possesses an elite corps of 
dreamblades who are trained to fight psionic foes; this unit includes 
psions with disciplines like <i>negate psionics </i>and <i>null psionics field</i>. These specialists are deployed against rogue shadows and the kalashtar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The actions of the field agents are coordinated by the 
Circle of Night. The Circle is comprised of the most powerful psions 
among the Inspired, and only the members of the circle have the power to
 implant a <i>mind seed</i>. The leader of the Circle is formally known 
as the Devourer of Dreams, but this title is usually shortened to "the 
Dreamer'. While the Dreamer is the de facto leader of the organization, 
he serves a still greater power -- the Dreaming Dark itself. Located in 
the heart of Dal Quor, this is a force composed of the spirits of 
thousands of Quori and mortal dreamers that have been absorbed over the 
millennia. The Dreaming Dark has long been the driving force behind the 
quori, but its motives and goals are impossible for the mortal mind to 
comprehend. The Devourer of Dreams is the only being who can commune 
with the Dark without being absorbed and destroyed, and he can channel a
 fraction of its immense power. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Physically, the agents of the Dreaming Dark are 
scattered across Eberron. However, when one of the Inspired sleeps, her 
spirit returns to her fiendish body in Dal Quor. The Dreaming Dark 
maintains a vast city-fortress in Dal Quor, and the Circle of Night 
controls the actions of the dark from the heart of this citadel. While 
all members of the Dreaming Dark have host bodies on Eberron, many 
members of the Circle of Night make little use of these bodies; as a 
result they are always to be found in Dal Quor, where they can take the 
reports of agents of the Dark and provide new orders. For every minute 
of time that passes on Eberron, ten minutes passes in Dal Quor; as a 
result, when an Inspired agent spends 4 hours asleep, she has 40 hours 
in Dal Quor to report to the Circle of Night, coordinate with allies, 
and prepare for future missions. Shadow agents have less power and 
control in the Region of Dreams, but the Circle of Night can draw the 
spirit of a dreaming shadow to the citadel to receive new orders. The 
net result is that the Dreaming Dark invariably acts with careful 
planning and perfect coordination; over the course of a night, an agent 
in Khorvaire could spread a piece of valuable information across the 
length of the world. </p>

<p align="left">For more insight into the world of <b>Eberron</b>, check out <i><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.paizo.com/dragon.shtml&amp;origin=dnd_eb_20040413a">Dragon</a></i> magazine for the next installation of a six-part monthly series: "Countdown to the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting.</i>"</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue #319 </b>(that's the May issue, which goes on 
sale this month) gives you a look at some of the magic that fills the 
world of Eberron, including an assortment of new spells and clerical 
domains, and a preview of one of the more interesting and dangerous 
creatures spawned by the Last War: the living spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 318 </b>(April) takes a long, hard look at the fourth unique character race created especially for the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting</i>: a sentient race of constructs known as the warforged.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 317 </b>(March) introduces you to three of the unique character races created especially for the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting</i>:
 Changelings, the Kalashtar, and Shifters (with a close look at 
shifters), along with a glimpse at how all the standard character races 
fit into the new world. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 316</b> (February) gives you an idea of how all
 of the standard character classes fit in the setting, introduces you to
 an all-new character class -- the artificer -- and introduces you to 
another of the setting's prestige classes: the master inquisitive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue 315 </b>(January) offers more insight into the tone and attitude of the new <b>D&amp;D</b> world, along with a little of Eberron's most recent history. </p>

<p align="LEFT">This June, you'll be able to pick up and start exploring every aspect of the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting.</i>
 Every month until then, we'll offer up more material to help you get an
 even better idea of what you'll encounter when you do. Next month, 
you'll get a glance at a few of the new monsters you'll soon discover 
lurking all across Khorvaire and regions beyond (possibly even invading 
your other home campaigns as well--beware).</p>
