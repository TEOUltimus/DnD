<p align="LEFT">While <b>Eberron</b> may be a new campaign setting, it's
 a world created with a lot of history. A good amount of Eberron's past 
will be slowly discovered and revealed as time goes on. But when the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 releases, you'll find yourself exploring and adventuring in a world 
caught up in the aftermath of a terrible war that darkened the world for
 a hundred years and more.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Recent History of Eberron</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As the campaign begins, Eberron emerges from a long and 
devastating war. The nations of the continent of Khorvaire were once 
part of a great kingdom of legend, the mighty kingdom of Galifar. When 
King Jarot died, his five heirs, each in command of one of the Five 
Nations that comprised the kingdom, refused to bow to tradition. Instead
 of allowing the eldest son to take the crown, the siblings rallied 
their vassals and each vied to take control of the kingdom. Over time, 
this decades-long conflict became known as the Last War, for everyone 
imagined that when it finally ended the taste for bloodshed and battle 
would be wiped from the face of Khorvaire. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The Last War continued for more than a century, with 
each of the Five Nations alternately fighting against or alongside one 
or more of the others as alliances and animosities shifted as fast as 
the wind in the Shargon Straits. In time, other nations formed as deals 
were made and opportunities presented themselves. After 102 years of 
fighting, the leaders of the recognized nations of Khorvaire (which now 
numbered twelve) met at the ancient capital of Galifar to draft a peace.
 With the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold, the Last War came to an 
end.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Today, the nations of Khorvaire seek to rebuild and 
prosper as the new peace spreads across the land. While technically at 
peace, the nations continue to vie for economic and political supremacy.
 Minor skirmishes break out every so often, especially in the more 
remote sections of the continent and on the most hotly contested 
borders. Espionage and sabotage are the preferred method of diplomacy, 
as the nations engage in trade and discussion in public while working 
intrigues and double-crosses in the shadows.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Another chunk of knowledge you'll find useful and/or 
interesting about the world of Eberron is how its cosmology works. That 
is, where Eberron fits in with the other planes of existence. 
Interestingly, planar travel in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 is somewhat different from other settings in which you may have 
adventured, because the option to shift from one plane to another is not
 always an option. Each of the other planes that exist in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 is accessible to or from Eberron only during certain periods of time. 
These windows of opportunity vary from plane to plane in both their 
duration and frequency, as you'll discover when you check out this 
excerpt from Chapter 5:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=/dnd/images/Eberron_Cosmology_lg.jpg&amp;origin=dnd_eb_20040309a"><img src="2004%20-%2003-09%20-%20Some%20Perspective%20on%20the%20World%20of%20Eberron_files/Eberron_Cosmology_med.jpg" border="0" height="341" width="330"></a></p>
<p class="size3" align="center"><b>(<a href="javascript:makeWinXY('/dnd/orary/orary.asp',%20500,%20510)" class="cboxhead">Launch Eberron Orrery</a>) <br><span class="size2">See the planes in motion!</span></b></p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>Planes of Existence</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Eberron spins within its own Material Plane, enfolded by
 three coexistent transitive planes: the Ethereal Plane, the Plane of 
Shadow, and the Astral Plane, just as in the core <b>D&amp;D</b> cosmology (see Chapter 5 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). </p>
<p align="LEFT">Within Eberron's Astral Plane, thirteen planes spin in a
 complex orbit around the Material Plane. These planes combine the 
features of inner and outer planes: some have an elemental nature, some 
have alignment tendencies, and others are simply alien worlds. These 
planes are home to all the extraplanar creatures detailed in the <i>Monster Manual.</i> In contrast to the core <b>D&amp;D</b> cosmology, these planes are <i>not</i> the home of the deities, and only one of them, Dolurrh, is a plane where mortal spirits go upon their death.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The thirteen orbiting planes are separate from each 
other, with no connections between them. They are coexistent with the 
Astral Plane, but separate from the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of 
Shadow, so certain spells (<i>ethereal jaunt </i>and<i> shadow walk,</i>
 for example) aren't available to casters on these planes. Each of them 
occasionally becomes coterminous with the Material Plane, allowing 
connections between the planes (see Planar Connections, below).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Planar Connections</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As the thirteen planes move through the Astral Plane, 
their paths take them closer to the Material Plane at times, and farther
 away at other times. A plane's distance from the Material Plane is 
described in three categories:</p>
<table align="center" bgcolor="#E4E4E4" border="0" width="530" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Coterminous:</b> On rare occasions, a plane comes so 
near the Material Plane that it actually touches it. At these times, it 
is possible to move freely between the Material Plane and the 
coterminous plane at certain locations on each plane. For example, when 
Fernia is coterminous to the Material Plane, a character can travel to 
Fernia by means of a volcano or any extremely hot fire -- and the 
natives of Fernia can enter Eberron just as easily. Different planes' 
paths through the Astral Plane bring them into a coterminous 
relationship with varying frequency: Fernia draws near fairly often (one
 month every four years), while Xoriat has not done so in over 7,000 
years.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a plane is coterminous with the Material Plane, 
certain of its traits may bleed over into the Material Plane, or at 
least certain regions of the Material Plane. For example, when Risia is 
coterminous to the Material Plane, spells with the cold descriptor are 
enhanced in certain areas of the Material Plane. Not all planes have 
traits that spill over to the Material Plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Waxing/Waning:</b> As a plane draws close to becoming
 coterminous it is called waxing, and as it moves away after a period of
 being coterminous it is waning. There are no special effects on the 
Material Plane when a plane is waxing or waning.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Remote:</b> When a plane is remote, it is difficult 
to establish any connection at all between it and the Material Plane. 
When Fernia is remote, fire spells work less effectively, fire 
elementals are hard to summon, and it is nearly impossible to reach that
 plane via <i>plane shift.</i> Using <i>plane shift</i> to travel to a 
remote plane or using any spell to call or summon a native of that plane
 requires a Spellcraft check (DC 30 + spell level); a character with 5 
or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes) receives a +2 circumstance bonus
 on this check. </p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Planes in Play:</b> Sages and astronomers of 
Eberron use complex orreries and extensive charts to track the position 
of the planes relative to Eberron. No DM should have to go to such 
lengths. For simplicity in play, bring a given plane into a coterminous 
position when it suits the needs of your campaign. If consistency is 
important to you, keep track of when that occurred and when it will 
happen again, using the information in each plane's description. If not,
 don't worry about it -- just bring it back into a coterminous position 
the next time it suits your campaign. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The planes spend most of the time either waxing or 
waning, so it is safe to assume that, any time it matters, the PCs can 
summon whatever monster they want to without making a Spellcraft check 
and even travel to another plane using <i>plane shift</i> as they desire. Only put as much effort into tracking the planar positions as the needs of your campaign demand. </p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>The Cosmology of Eberron</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Daanvi, the Perfect Order</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Orderly fields where formians tend ideal crops, 
regimented garrisons of disciplined soldiers, and peaceful communities 
where law reigns supreme manifest throughout the plane of Daanvi, the 
Perfect Order. Similar in many respects to the plane of Arcadia in the <b>D&amp;D</b> cosmology, Daanvi is a place where all things live in harmony born of order.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When mortals dream, they psychically project their minds
 to Dal Quor, the plane where dreams play out. Dal Quor is ringed with 
dreamscapes -- small, temporary envelopes of pseudoreality where 
dreamers live their dreams for a short time. Within the ring, however, 
exists an entirely different world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Magnificent domed cities called up from the formless 
void of dreamstuff spread across the inside of the ring of dreamscapes, 
allowing the quori who live there easy access to their food supply -- 
the psychic energy of dreaming mortals. Beyond the cities of the quori, a
 roiling boil of dream-born landscapes melt, burn, grow, and dissolve 
without any rhyme or reason. Tales persist of a calm eye at the center 
of this storm, but they are most likely figments of some half-remembered
 dream.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A place of hopelessness, eternal despair, and consuming apathy, Dolurrh is the realm where mortal souls go after death.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fernia, the Sea of Fire</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Flame covers everything on Fernia, the Sea of Fire. The 
ground is nothing more than great, ever-shifting plates of compressed 
flame, ash, and debris. The air ripples with the heat of continual 
firestorms. Oceans of liquid flame ebb and flow, and mountains ooze with
 molten lava. Fire rages, with no need for fuel or air, across this 
continually burning landscape.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Irian, the Eternal Day</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A brilliant white sun hangs in the center of a 
crystalline sky, bathing the radiant landscape below in shadowless 
light. Forests of crystalline growths, mountains of pure quartz, rivers 
of liquid glass, and sun-bleached deserts of pure white sand define the 
landscape of this plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Irian is awash in positive energy -- not so intense as 
to harm life, but sufficient to encourage and sustain life in a variety 
of unusual forms. Creatures of light and life make their home here, but 
not necessarily creatures of good.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kythri, the Churning Chaos</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A roiling soup of land, water, air, protoplasmic ooze, 
fire, magma, hissing steam, smoke, dust, ice, blinding light, pitch 
darkness, acid, flashing lightning, cacophonous sound, and seemingly 
every other substance and energy found in the universe fills the plane 
of Kythri. Every part of the plane constantly changes. A creature, 
native or just visiting, can sometimes exert enough will to hold a 
location constant and stable -- for a short time.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lamannia, the Twilight Forest</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Lamannia, the Twilight Forest, is a realm of raw and 
wild nature unbounded, untouched by civilization. Despite its name, the 
forests that stretch in all directions are not the only terrain feature 
of the plane; majestic mountains, wide grasslands, sultry swamps, 
rolling hills, and even deserts and tundras make up the vibrant life of 
Lamannia. All kinds of plants, animals, magical beasts, and bestial 
outsiders are found in the Twilight Forest, as well as air, earth, and 
water elementals. Lycanthropes, too -- rare on Eberron -- are common in 
Lamannia, since many fled to this plane during the crusade that nearly 
exterminated them from Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lamannia has the following traits:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Enhanced magic: Druid spells are extended.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lamannia Inhabitants:</b> Achaierai, animals (all), 
arrowhawk (all), belker, celestial animals, bebilith (demon), hellcat 
(devil), air elemental (all), earth elemental (all), water elemental 
(all), fiendish animals, djinni (genie), avoral (guardinal), leonal 
(guardinal), hellwasp swarm, invisible stalker, lycanthropes (all), air 
mephit, dust mephit, earth mephit, ooze mephit, salt mephit, water 
mephit, nightmare, thoqqua, tojanida (all), vermin (all), xorn (all), 
yeth hound.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Manual of the Planes: </i>dao (genie), marid (genie), ooze paraelemental (all), smoke paraelemental (all).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Coterminous:</b> When Lamannia is coterminous with 
the Material Plane, the power of nature grows. In regions of unspoiled 
nature (particularly the Eldeen Reaches), plants grow more verdant and 
animals breed more prolifically. <i>Summon nature's ally</i> spells are extended throughout the Material Plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lamannia is coterminous for a period of one week every 13 months.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Remote:</b> When Lamannia is remote from the Material
 Plane, nature's power diminishes. Animals have small litters and plants
 -- even cultivated crops -- grow poorly. <i>Summon nature's ally</i> 
spells are impeded during this time. Lamannia is remote for a period of 
one week every thirteen months, exactly 6-1/2 months after its 
coterminous period.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mabar, the Endless Night</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Utter blackness where no light shines fills the plane of
 Mabar, the Endless Night. The starless night lasts forever, its gloom 
never diminishing in the least. The darkness literally devours the life 
of visitors to this plane, extinguishing every spark of light that dares
 intrude upon the Endless Night.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Risia, the Plain of Ice</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A blizzard above a field of blowing snow that covers an 
infinite glacier, Risia consists of layer upon layer of cold and ice. 
Though mountains break the line of the plain here and there, they are 
formed of solid ice, not stone. Lakes and streams mark the landscape, 
but they are simply places where the air itself has congealed to frigid 
liquid, deadly to the touch. The air of Risia freezes the eyes and 
lungs, the wind steals breath, and the snow buries and entombs all 
things.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shavarath, the Battleground</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Three great armies mass eternally on the barren plains 
of Shavarath: a celestial host of archons, an infernal regiment of 
devils, and a swarming horde of demons. Warfare defines all aspects of 
their existence. Alliances come and go -- usually involving the devils 
allying with one or the other of their enemies and then breaking the 
alliance when the situation changes to their advantage -- but the 
warfare never ends. Slain soldiers eventually return, usually in a lower
 form, but the armies of the three forces remain forever in a rough 
balance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fortresses dot the landscape of Shavarath, each one 
locked in a great siege. Every fortress eventually falls, and they all 
shift hands many times before finally being reduced to rubble. As one 
collapses, a new one is built to replace it. Beyond these fortresses, 
the rocky and barren landscape stretches in all direction, sporadically 
accentuated by low hills -- the only distinguishable terrain anywhere on
 the plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Shavarath has the following traits:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alignment traits: Areas held by the archons are mildly 
good-aligned and mildly lawful-aligned. Areas held by the devils are 
mildly evil-aligned and mildly lawful-aligned. Areas held by the demons 
are mildly chaos-aligned and mildly evil-aligned. These areas shift 
constantly, the borders as fluid as the tide of war.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Enhanced magic: Spells that create, enhance, or mimic weapons (such as <i>flame blade, keen edge, </i>or <i>Mordenkainen's sword</i>), and spells that excite hostile emotions (such as <i>rage, heroism, </i>or <i>antipathy</i>) are extended.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Impeded magic: Compulsions that calm or pacify hostile creatures, and all charms, are impeded.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Whirling Blades: Creatures not native to Shavarath are 
subject to attack by whirling blades that travel the plane like flocks 
of birds. An attack occurs every round once a flock of whirling blades 
is encountered (70% chance): attack bonus +10 melee (2d6). The blades 
are treated as magic and evil-aligned weapons for the purpose of 
bypassing damage reduction.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shavarath Inhabitants:</b> Hound archon, trumpet 
archon, babau (demon), dretch (demon), glabrezu (demon), hezrou (demon),
 marilith (demon), quasit (demon), retriever (demon), barbed devil, 
bearded devil, bone devil, chain devil, erinyes (devil), horned devil, 
imp (devil), vargouille.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Monster Manual II:</i> Bladeling.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Coterminous:</b> When Shavarath draws near, echoes of
 its endless battles manifest on the Material Plane. In any area 
embroiled in combat, the enhanced and impeded magic traits of Shavarath 
spill onto the Material Plane (impeded spells require a Spellcraft 
check, DC 15 + spell level to cast). Also, storms of whirling blades are
 known to appear at the sites of great battles, both past and present, 
when Shavarath is coterminous.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Shavarath is coterminous with the Material Plane for one year out of every thirty-six years.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Remote:</b> When Shavarath is remote, no known effects manifest on the Material Plane.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue #316</b> (February) gives you an idea of how 
all of the standard character classes fit in the setting, introduces you
 to an all-new character class -- the Artificer -- and introduces you to
 another of the setting's prestige classes: the master inquisitive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue #315 </b>(January) offers more insight into the tone and attitude of the new <b>D&amp;D</b> world, along with a little of Eberron's most recent history. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Syrania, the Azure Sky</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Crystalline cities float in Syrania's endless expanse of
 clear blue sky, their spires glittering in the ambient radiance of its 
perfect atmosphere. These cities are the homes of the angels -- each 
ruled by a solar. Angels are the only known inhabitants of this plane, 
and -- though little is known of Syrania -- it seems to be a nearly 
perfect paradise.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Thelanis, the Faerie Court</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Similar to both Eberron and Lamannia, Thelanis is a 
realm of rugged natural beauty -- primarily lush forests and 
crystal-clear waters. Among the trees rise shadowy spires of enchanting 
beauty, surrounded by mesmerizing lights like dancing lanterns. 
Phosphorescence gleams on plants and stones, lighting the eternal 
twilight of the plane, while a panoply of stars twinkle in the sky.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Xoriat, the Realm of Madness</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond words or comprehension, Xoriat is aptly called 
the Realm of Madness. Not only do its alien geometry and unspeakable 
inhabitants seem like the product of a madman's nightmare, but any who 
visit Xoriat risk finding their minds shattered by the experience.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xoriat has been likened to a stack of translucent 
parchment, an apparently infinite connection of layers and dimensions. 
Its inhabitants exist on multiple layers simultaneously. Massive, 
drifting entities too large to notice visitors to the plane; 
free-floating rivers of milk-white liquid; rains of blue globes falling 
from unseen heights, only to burst and release horse-sized ticks when 
they strike another object -- such are the madness-inducing features of 
Xoriat. Gelatinous worms wriggle from layer to layer, wending through 
tentacled vegetation encrusted with orange moss, all suspended above an 
amoebic sea. Over this mad realm the daelkyr are absolute masters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Like Dal Quor, Xoriat's last period of being coterminous
 with the Material Plane was a disastrous period of warfare. Over seven 
thousand years ago, Xoriat became coterminous and the daelkyr sent their
 minions into Khorvaire to conquer it. Before the orc and hobgoblin 
druids known as the Gatekeepers managed to end the planes' alignment, 
the mind flayers and lesser minions of the daelkyr had decimated the 
hobgoblin empire of Dhakaan. The Gatekeepers' magic was less cataclysmic
 than the giants' attempt to close the connection to Dal Quor, however; 
Xoriat moved quickly out of alignment but is sure to return one day.</p>

you'll get a good, hard look at the Kalashtar, a unique race created for
