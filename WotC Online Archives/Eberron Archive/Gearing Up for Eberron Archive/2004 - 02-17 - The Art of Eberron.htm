 in the early part of last summer, we created a promotional 
brochure-type thing to give away at Gen Con after the seminar about the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000">Eberron</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/eberron/864000000"> Campaign Setting</a>.</i>
 The piece needed to be exciting and evocative, but couldn't include 
much specific detail about the new setting (partly because many, many 
things were being worked out and partly because everything was very 
secret). What we did have was a binder full of really intriguing concept
 art. So we decided to turn the brochure into a travelogue -- a 
journal-type diary of a fast-paced trek across Eberron that was filled 
with sketches and observations made by a half-orc bard named Thunvarch. 
The travelogue not only allowed us to demonstrate how <b>Eberron</b> was, at its heart, a <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> world for <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> characters, but it also illustrated how different Eberron was from any other place we've ever adventured. </p>
<p align="LEFT"> When you get the chance to flip through a copy of the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> this June, you'll see what I mean -- the artwork in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> makes a huge impact on how you perceive the world. </p>

<p align="left">Considering how important the artwork in the<i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 is for establishing so much of the tone and attitude of the world, I 
thought it would be interesting to check in with the guy who's 
responsible for getting the art to do all that heavy lifting -- the art 
director for <b>Eberron</b>, Robert Raper. I caught up with Robert while he was busy at work at his computer, making a few tweaks to the cover art for the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>. He tweaked, I looked through some concept art, and we chatted a bit about what he'd been up to.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>How did you get started?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Because of the scope of the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting </i>(and
 the fact that it will be reincarnated in novels, electronics games, and
 miniatures, as well as roleplaying games), it was first necessary 
collaborate with several people. We set up a meeting with myself, Bill 
Slavicsek (who channeled Keith Baker), Peter Archer, and our three 
concept artists: Steve Prescott, Dana Knutson, and Mark Tedine. </p>
<p align="LEFT">I didn't want to be heavy-handed with art direction, so 
we provided them (the artists) with a short synopsis of the world, gave 
them an idea of the kind of look and feel we were shooting for, and set 
them loose. Each one of the artists was charged with creating artwork 
that really played to their strengths. Steve worked on character designs
 and creatures. (Wait until you see his Mournland Crab!) Dana focused on
 creatures and environments, such as the awesome monoliths of the 
Inspired. Mark worked on all three (characters, creatures, and 
environments) and came up with some really striking new looks -- the 
dwarves of the Mror Holds are a great example.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What kind of direction <i>did</i> you give the concept artists?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">I used a lot of analogies when I was trying to describe 
the setting. It's not steampunk, nor is it the Middle Ages or dark ages 
-- it's not traditional fantasy. <b>Eberron</b> is a world formed by a 
combination of cottage industry and a renaissance that came about as the
 result of a devastating magical war (nearly on the scale of a nuclear 
war).</p>
<table align="right" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><img src="2004%20-%2002-17%20-%20The%20Art%20of%20Eberron_files/ebb_20040217_Warforged.jpg" border="0" height="464" width="285"></td>

<tr><td class="size2red" align="center"><b>Warforged</b></td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">I told the artists to think of how things would evolve 
and be refined in their design in a world filled with magic. (It's kinda
 like how the Flintstones had an elephant for a dishwasher. In the <b>D&amp;D</b> world of Eberron, you would create the same convenience with magic. Instead of an elephant, you'd have an elemental.) To use a <i>Spinal Tap</i> reference, <b>D&amp;D</b> goes to ten. The <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>, goes to eleven. And Emiril Lagasse would tell the artists to "turn it up a notch."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What did you work on after starting the concept art?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Once we had the concept art started, I pitched the cover and overall visual look for the book itself. I wanted the <b>Eberron</b> line to really stand out on the shelves while tying in to the existing <b>D&amp;D</b>
 products they'd be up there with. I also wanted all of the books to 
have the same cover treatment across the line (like I did with the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> books). I chose a rich, saturated red from the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 palette to use as the principal color and had Daniel Hawkins sculpt the
 cover, leaving a prominent place on the front for artwork created by 
the cover artist I chose for the <b>Eberron</b> line: Wayne Reynolds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What was it about Wayne Reynolds' work that made you settle on him for the cover?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Wayne is one of the best interior illustrators in the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> rulebooks -- everything he does is gold. And people recognize his work as being very <b>D&amp;D</b>. (I recommended him for the job of creating the artwork for the <b>D&amp;D</b> 3.5 marketing campaign.) Between the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> logo and Wayne's art on the cover, there's no doubt that this is a <b>D&amp;D</b> book, only different (only better). Wayne's style is a blend of fine art with a hint of comic book, which makes it ideal for <b>Eberron.</b> The cover art he's done for the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 is really dynamic, using forced perspective, cocked "camera angles," 
and an almost over-the-top sense of action -- it's exactly what I was 
looking for. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Many of the interior artists you're using in </b>Eberron<b>, however, are new. Why not use other popular </b>D&amp;D<b> artists?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That's true: Almost all of the illustrators I have working on <b>Eberron</b> have never been used before for any <b>D&amp;D</b>
 product. There are a couple reasons for doing that. The simplest reason
 is logistics. Dawn Murin and I share a lot of really talented artists, 
and it made sense to broaden the talent pool we're drawing from (though 
she already wants to use Steve Prescott). The other reason is more 
compelling: I wanted to make sure that <b>Eberron</b> was visually different from <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> and the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>. <b>Eberron</b> has all the stuff you'd expect in <b>D&amp;D</b>. It's got all the depth you'd find in the Realms. But in <b>Eberron</b>,
 everything is amplified. The action is more intense. Everything is more
 interesting -- and it's up to the PCs to discover it all. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>What's your favorite stuff in the book? What's new or different?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">We haven't gotten all the art in yet, so it's hard to 
say. But it's all good. There will be a lot of really interesting things
 to check out when the book's finished. There are a lot of cool mutated 
creatures (monsters from your typical <b>D&amp;D</b> game) that you'll 
find in the Mournlands -- like the mutant centaur, which I'd describe as
 being the kind of centaur you'd run into on Mars in the movie <i>Total Recall.</i> The barbarians in <b>Eberron</b> aren't necessarily bulky, musclebound, Conan types; they're more like Manny from <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>
 -- thin and wiry, but you still wouldn't want to mess with them. The 
living spells are really cool -- some of the magic used in the Last War 
was so powerful that some of the spells linger on, with a life of their 
own. Also, you won't find any Celtic knots in there.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Anything else to add?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">I always hated DMs who wouldn't let you have magic. 
Campaigns like that are just too mundane. I'm all about the fantasy. And
 that's what you're going to get. The <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> is new -- it's <b>D&amp;D</b>, but better.</p>

<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Q&amp;A with Eberron Concept Artist Steve Prescott</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What did you do for the </b><i>Eberron<b> Campaign Setting</b></i><b>?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This was one of those rare times when my timing was 
perfect and the planets aligned in my favor. I was looking for work and 
contacted Robert Raper having only worked with him briefly one time 
before. It just so happened that the <b>Eberron</b> pre-production was 
coming up and (lucky for me) Robert saw some creative aspect that he 
liked in my artwork. So I was hired on to be one-third of the concept 
artist crew (along with Dana Knutson and Mark Tedin). </p>
<p align="LEFT">Robert contracted me to do 60 fully visualized conceptual drawings of anything mentioned in the <b>Eberron</b>
 notes or beyond. He specifically wanted me to work on the different 
cultures and races of Eberron -- character/costume design, etc., which 
was right up my alley (but I still dabbled a little with other things 
such as environments and monsters). </p>
<p align="LEFT">So, Wizards of the Coast flew me out to Seattle for a 
week to work hands-on with the creative team -- having meetings in the 
morning and then working with Dana and Mark for the rest of the day 
pounding out concepts and ideas. We didn't get 60 drawings apiece done 
in the week that I was out there, so much of the project was done 
through the magic of group emails. But that initial week of working with
 a team was absolutely invaluable. There's no way I could have done the 
work I did if I had done the whole project at home here in Columbus -- 
without directly being there and without the much more efficient 
communication (and enthusiasm) that comes from <i>seeing</i> the team's 
reaction to sketches and ideas. Imagine showing a drawing and your 
response is either an e-mail that says "Great job!" or a bunch of guys 
leaning over a big table to get a better view and seeing their faces 
light up as they place your drawing into action in their heads -- then 
the quick exchanges of ideas, the thinking out loud that floods out in 
the next ten minutes. E-mail doesn't offer that kind of forum. Many 
concepts were formed in just a few quick, fun responses during a 
meeting. It was very cool. Dana and Mark live in Seattle so I was 
essentially the wild card -- the relatively unknown artist that was 
being flown in from the other side of the country -- I'm still flattered
 when I think about it! But what a great and successful idea that was --
 it put me on a creative high, basically. I had so much fun that I 
actually ended up doing about five drawings more than I needed to and 
could have done many more!</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>What is it about the art that makes it "</b>Eberron<b>" rather than just "</b>D&amp;D<b>"? (What did you do to give your work an "</b>Eberron<b>" look and feel?)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That's hard to say. The <b>Eberron</b> project was really my first foray into Wizards' fantasy games so I personally didn't have an established "look" for <b>D&amp;D</b>
 to try and build on or avoid (which was probably why I they hired me!).
 Basically, I approached the work as if I was redesigning <b>D&amp;D</b> to my own flavor to fit the <b>Eberron</b> template. </p>
<p align="LEFT">I've always been influenced by motifs and designs from 
different cultures (African, Turkish, Native American, Arabian, etc) so I
 naturally infused a lot of that to help define each <b>Eberron</b> culture. Of course, it was key to have such provocative ideas for me to run with and the <b>Eberron</b> world definitely provided that. Overall, the look has a slightly more modernized feel than <b>D&amp;D. </b>There
 are fantastic modes of transportation and bigger cities -- and a lot 
more political intrigue. I think there is more of a focus on being 
"worldly" than in <b>D&amp;D.</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Designing cultures and classes, I worked a lot of layers
 into the costumes. Some fighters have thick overcoats over different 
layers of armor instead of just half-plate or just chainmail -- things 
like that. I also tried to establish at least one very basic element for
 each race's apparel. The Talenta Halflings use bold geometric shapes on
 their clothes like thick colorful stripes or patterns made of triangles
 and squares. Lhazaar folk use a lot of insulative animal hides and furs
 layered in creative ways. The barbarians who live on the continent of 
Argonnessen wear a lot a lot of shells, beads, scales from huge sea 
creatures, and shark teeth, etc. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What excites you the most about the look and feel of </b>Eberron<b>? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">There's no way for this to NOT sound ego-driven but I'm 
most excited that I got to be part of creating this whole new realm -- 
that people are going to (I hope!) get excited about the different 
aspects of the game, namely the parts that I had a hand in creating. Not
 so I can boast about it, but because it'll feel really good to know it 
is successful -- that I helped make something that people are inspired 
by, that they have fun with, something evocative -- mainly that, "Hey, 
I'm doing something right!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">But I'm also excited to keep working on <b>Eberron</b> 
and keep expanding on this world. It was defined and detailed enough to 
give us artists plenty to work with, yet has so much room for expansion 
-- there's still a lot of <b>Eberron</b> to be discovered. I really hope the game is popular enough that it'll keep me having fun with it for a long time!</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>What did you have fun working on? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">I had fun working on <i>everything</i>! I seriously could have continued doing conceptual design work on <b>Eberron</b>
 for another year at least. I wanted to get in and design every aspect 
in detail -- what kinds of foods the Valenar Elves eat, the ships the 
Lhazaar people run around in, the different military outfits of the 
Emerald Claw -- everything! It's hard to pick out one or even a couple 
of my favorites things but I had a lot of fun with the Talenta 
Halflings, Valenar and Aerenal Elves, and the warforged, of course. I 
also had fun dabbling in creating new creatures like the Mournland Crab,
 the Sea Tiger, the Tribex, and the Dragonhawk -- those were all fun to 
do. I guess my favorite pieces were some of the class/culture designs - 
the warforged wizard, Talenta Halfling bard, Lhazaar warrior, the 
Hobgoblin Darguun Warlord, and I loved drawing the Argonnessen 
barbarians. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But that's just <i>within</i> the project -- the best 
part was the whole experience. This was undoubtedly a major highlight in
 my career: to be picked up so quickly and flown out to Seattle -- plane
 tickets, hotel, and rental car paid for -- and work on a huge project 
for the biggest RPG company in the world with such an enthusiastic and 
skilled group of directors and artists. I still have trouble processing 
it. What a change from being cooped up by myself in my studio! It all 
seemed to just click, and the result was probably the most creative work
 I have done so far. On top of all that, I got to meet and make friends 
with some great people: Robert Raper, Mark Tedin, and namely Dana 
Knutson and Dawn Murin. I was sad to fly back home even though I missed 
my wife and dog!</p>

<p align="LEFT">Where the <b>D&amp;D</b><b>Greyhawk</b> and <b>Forgotten Realms</b> settings are loosely based upon Western ancient/medieval concepts and cultures (with obvious exceptions), <b>Eberron</b>
 takes additional visual references from the more tribal cultures of 
Africa, Ancient South America and the Ancient Middle East. Added to that
 is a bit of herme-technology (magically enhanced machinery). </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What excites you the most about the look and feel of </b>Eberron<b>? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">It's the diversity of images. When I was presented with the original <b>Eberron</b>
 concept art I was completely blown away with the imagery that was in 
there. There are so many concepts to excite the imagination. I was 
especially taken with the Warforged. When I'm painting a picture with 
one of those metal guys in it, I start to imagine what sort of culture 
they have. Even though they're constructed from metal, they still wear 
clothes. So there has to be an element of vanity in their society. These
 are the sorts of things I think about while I'm working.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What did you have fun working on? What's your favorite piece? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">I've enjoyed working on all the <b>Eberron</b> art. It's
 enough for me to depict something that really inspires the imagination.
 If I can convey something that excites the imagination of the viewer, 
then my job is done. As to my favorite piece . . . that's a tricky one. 
I'm so self-critical that I'm generally dissatisfied with my own work. 
I'd probably go for the <i>Sharn:</i><i>City of Towers</i> cover. There's a lot going on in the picture. I was surprised I managed to fit it all in.</p>

<p align="LEFT"> This June, you'll be able to pick up and start exploring the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting.</i>
 Every month until then, we'll offer up more material to help you get an
 even better idea of what you'll encounter when you do. Next month, 
you'll get a quick history lesson on what's been taking place in <b>Eberron</b>, along with a look at the unique cosmology of the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting</i>.</p>

 the March issue, which goes on sale this month) introduces you to three
 of the unique character races created especially for the <i><b>Eberron</b></i><i>Campaign Setting</i>:
 changelings, the kalashtar, and shifters (with a close look at 
shifters), along with a glimpse at how all the standard character races 
fit into the new world. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Issue #316</b> (that's the February issue) gives you 
an idea of how all of the standard character classes fit in the setting,
 introduces you to an all-new character class -- the artificer -- and 
introduces you to another of the setting's prestige classes: the master 
inquisitive. <b>Issue #315 </b>(the January issue), introduces you to the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> and offers more insight into the tone and attitude of the new <b>D&amp;D</b> world, along with a little of Eberron's most recent history. </p>
