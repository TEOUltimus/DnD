<p align="LEFT">Welcome again to Steal This Hook! Adventure stories 
thrive on horror -- fear is a natural motivator for characters to 
perform desperate (read: action-point-involving) acts. In the spirit of 
the season, and particularly in the spirit of 18th and 19th century 
gothic horror fiction, the theme of this edition of Steal This Hook! is <i>ghoulish tales. </i>These are adventure hooks you can use to weave a bit of gloomy, gothic horror into your <i>Eberron</i> campaign. Let's get ghoulish...</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2010-25%20-%20Ghoulish%20Tales_files/eb_brain_jar.jpg" alt="Brain in a Jar" title="Brain in a Jar" align="right" border="0"><b>The Morgue-Mind</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A murder mystery the heroes are investigating leads them
 to the Constable's Morgue, a particularly large corpse-storehouse run 
by law enforcement. The heroes stumble on a gruesome scene: the kindly 
old clerk at the morgue is hunched over one body with a saw, and has 
already mutilated several other bodies in storage there. After the clerk
 is apprehended, the local sheriff tells PCs that this behavior is 
wildly out of character for the gentle clerk; someone or some<i>thing</i> must have induced him to perform these awful acts. <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/iw/20041015b&amp;page=2">A brain in a jar</a> (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179240000">Libris Mortis</a></i>)
 created by a necromancer has taken up hidden residence at the morgue, 
and is looking for a new body to inhabit. The diseased brain uses its 
psionic powers to control those around it to find the perfect body. 
Perhaps only the necromancer herself, full of remorse at her inability 
to control the awful creation, can help the PCs to stop it. Or will the 
brain decide that the skull of the necromancer who created it would be 
its perfect home?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Bell in the Mist</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The fog that envelops the Mournlands muffles most sound,
 but the toll of a bell echoes through the dead-gray mist, beckoning the
 heroes to investigate. Following the sound, the PCs discover a small 
church, its white paint flaking away with age, its pews rotting. The 
bell in the tower is being rung by the <i>telekinesis</i> abilities of 
two ghosts, a young girl and a young boy. When approached, they mouth 
silent words and flee through a wall toward the small graveyard behind 
the church, and the spectral form of a long-dead cleric appears in their
 place! Is this a malevolent spectre (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000"><i>Monster Manual</i></a>)
 looking to create more spectres to enthrall or a friendly ghost who 
needs a favor? Are the ghost children bait for the trap of a warforged 
necromancer or are they helpless spirits unable to leave the churchyard 
since the Day of Mourning?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Hand-Takers</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Someone in urban Zilargo is stealing hands. The bodies 
of gnomes, humans, and other races have turned up with their hands 
sliced off at the wrist -- over twelve such bodies in Korranberg alone. 
The heroes meet a crucial witness when a handless warforged comes 
forward with a fantastic story: that he survived an attack by a gang of 
rune-covered skeletons with <i>fleshy hands</i>. The bony gang 
overpowered him and knocked him unconscious, and when he awoke, his 
appendages (one hand and one armblade) were taken. Is a group of 
spellstitched undead (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882680000"><i>Monster Manual II</i></a>)
 the cause of the attacks? Are the attacks random, or are the victims 
connected somehow? Perhaps a sick-minded sorcerer wants the hands of 
master artisans, believing they will grant him creative power. Perhaps a
 Vol cultist is using the hands to imbue his animated dead minions with 
the arcane abilities of the hands' former owners. Either way, the bony 
gang (one of which now sports an armblade) may attack the characters 
next.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Six Piles of Ashes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Six citizens of Bluevine in Aundair have gone missing 
over six nights, and the remaining townsfolk seek the help of anyone 
brave enough to investigate. Bluevine's town meeting-place, a dusty 
field surrounding a huge, artistically-carved boulder outside of town, 
appears to be the source of the trouble. The heroes find the boulder 
encircled by half a dozen scorched and shallow pits, each containing a 
hill of ashes. The base of the boulder is blackened with soot as well --
 what could be going on? Is the boulder a Gatekeeper seal designed to 
keep a daelkyr lord away from this plane? Or is it a focus for dark 
fire-elemental energies? Has magical mischief summoned a magma mephit, 
which is in turn summoning others of its kind to prey on sleepy 
Bluevine? Does the boulder conceal a geothermal vent leading down to the
 lair of a conflagration ooze (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179210000"><i>Monster Manual III</i></a>) hungry for chaos and panic?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Leech of Zarash'ak</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Zarash'ak is called the City of Stilts because of the 
supports that keep it above the gloomy waters of the Shadow Marches. 
Those same supports also hide certain...activities...that occur in the 
waters from being seen from the city walkways above. Grulsh was a 
half-orc member of House Tharashk and a productive merchant in Eberron 
dragonshards before he was turned into a vampire. Now the raging 
blood-thirst within him compels him to do evil, and he preys on the 
working class of the city he once loved. Using his <i>spider climb</i> 
ability, he creeps along the undersides of Zarash'ak walkways, snatching
 unsuspecting travelers and draining their blood before slinking off to a
 coffin sunk somewhere in the muck. The heroes are hired by House 
Tharashk to help them uncover the mystery of the disappearing travelers,
 and Grulsh's disappearance is their first priority.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Mini-hooks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Want more Eberron-style ghoulish tales? Here are some mini-hooks to prime your imagination. (Happy Halloween!)</p>
<ul>
<li>A pirate captain of Lhazaar was buried alive by his mutinous crew on
 the island of Greentarn. Rumor has it that if one spends a night in the
 pirate's coffin, buried alive in the same wooden box, the pirate's 
spirit will appear and describe the whereabouts of lost treasure.</li>
<li>A deathguard paladin from Aerenal asks for the heroes' help in annihilating a charnel hound (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179210000"><i>Monster Manual III</i></a>) that stalks the wilds of his homeland.</li>
<li>A kalashtar child's nightmares begin corrupting the thoughts of her entire village.</li>
<li>When an eccentric old gnome is questioned about a series of murders, he blames the creepy marionettes that reside in his attic.</li>
<li>Under deep vaults in the Mror Holds lie the remains of a long-dead 
madman, which must be properly buried in sanctified ground before his 
spirit will stop haunting the mountain passes.</li>
<li>Dusty footprints lead toward, but not away from, a macabre oil 
painting that seems to add more and more faces onto its canvas each 
night.</li>
<li>One clear night every year, a lightning rail junction replays the 
scene of a terrible crash that occurred there during the first days of 
the rail system.</li>
<li>A rakshasa begins construction of an enormous musical instrument 
composed of the skulls and bones of hundreds of elves -- an eldritch 
machine designed to bring forth melodies capable of waking the 
rakshasa's dark masters.</li>
</ul>
