<p align="left">Welcome again to Steal This Hook! This edition's theme is <i>dramatic brawls:</i>
 adventure hooks designed to get those PCs into combat in unusual 
environments and unpredictable conditions, possibly with 
campaign-altering consequences. These could work well as climactic 
campaign-enders with the Big Bad Guy, or simply as minor scuffles with 
minions and no-names. Above all, they're designed to inspire fight 
scenes that have the <b>Eberron</b> tone of pulp adventure.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Showdown in the Laboratory</b></p>
<p align="left">The heroes track an unscrupulous artificer to his 
laboratory deep in a range of mountains. When they arrive, they see that
 he has equipped himself with bizarre machinery throughout his body: 
Hoses feed liquids to his limbs; pistons pump in and out of his 
shoulders; metal components embedded in his muscles move as he moves. He
 utters villainous curses with a smile on his lips, and begins . . . <i>growing</i>.
 His muscles expand and his head bloats horribly. And with the flip of a
 switch on his midsection, the artificer's body suddenly bristles with 
an array of magic weapons. He attacks the party, firing magic missiles 
from a wandlike appendage, shooting bolts from a tentacle-mounted 
crossbow, and blowing flames from an open panel in his chest. The fight 
should be short and destructive: The artificer drags hoses as he fights,
 pulling down vats of vital acids which will in turn eat away at 
important magical generators. The artificer's growth should be unstable 
-- he has put too much experimentation into his own body, and he won't 
be able to handle the mutation.</p>
<p align="left">What led to this fight? Was part of Sharn experiencing a
 mystic brownout from drained power? Did multiple wizards report 
powerful reagents missing? Did a local village hear strange, haunting 
laughter from a nearby mountain pass?</p>
<p align="left">What happens after the fight? Must the PCs discover the 
artificer's identity, or why he's done this to himself? Must they return
 a critical component of the artificer's body to a needy town? Must they
 free the kidnap victims, whose living liquids fed the artificer's 
unnatural experiments?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Raw Fish Rumble</b></p>
<p align="left">The fight breaks out at Salgandro's, an expensive fish 
restaurant above the east bank of Breland's Dagger River. Salgandro's 
has twenty round tables for four and six tables for eight, and each 
table has a linen tablecloth and fine place settings. A kitchen 
outfitted with large grills and two wood-burning ovens supplies food to 
customers. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows on the river side, 
diners can see that the river tumbles 7 or 8 feet over a small waterfall
 -- a spectacle that diners can view from a narrow deck attached to the 
restaurant if they are romantically inclined. The fight might occur 
table to table, or back into the kitchen, or into the storage pantry in 
the small basement. In the center of the restaurant, Salgandro's has a 
columnar aquarium 10 feet in diameter, outfitted with authentic 
representations of Dagger River life -- fish, pebbly sediment, ropy and 
kelplike river plants, the underwater wooden nests of beavers. If the 
glass were to be smashed by a villain, it would alter the terrain 
significantly -- first a quick onrush of pebbly water, then a wet 
unstable landscape full of floating napkin holders and flappy fish. 
Other details include chandeliers made from native moose antlers, lit 
candles on every table, fish netting decorating the walls, and proudly 
displayed mounts of prize river catches by the owner.</p>
<p align="left">What led to this fight? Did an escaped Jungle Boy 
gangster flee here, seeking protection from his brother, Salgandro's 
head chef? Were the diners attacked by sahuagin scouts from downriver? 
Have assassins ambushed a scholar here who means to publish certain 
Emerald Claw secrets?</p>
<p align="left">What happens after the fight? Do the heroes help with 
the cleanup? Are they chased off by the rolling-pin-waving owner, or 
embraced by her in gratitude? Does the bad guy dive off the deck into 
the river, go over the tiny falls, and disappear mysteriously into the 
foamy depths?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Ambushed by the Olmstoys</b></p>
<p align="left">In a dusty subterranean crypt, the heroes find the 
bodies of the Olmstoys, a bygone noble family. The Olmstoys are arranged
 in strange, standing positions, and in some cases they still wear 
burial armor. When one of the PCs trips over a dust-submerged cable, it 
yanks some mechanism deep in the crypt walls, and a mighty magic machine
 is set in motion. Set in the ceiling, behind a protective iron cage, 
glows a blue gem that animates the Olmstoys -- and they're not happy to 
see the intruders. The fight that results will involve flesh-obsessed 
zombies, the fickle lighting of sputtering everbrights, choking clouds 
of dust, swarms of clicking beetles, further tripwire-and-gear traps, a 
decades-old living spell or two, and possibly even the matriarch of the 
Olmstoy family -- a grisly, level-draining wight.</p>
<p align="left">What led to this fight? Were the PCs tasked to recover a
 burial trinket from one of the Olmstoys' bodies? Did they seek the 
powerful blue gem or information about the crypt's mechanisms? Did they 
follow a gang of shifter graverobbers here, looking to solve a mystery 
surrounding the sale of black-market antiques?</p>
<p align="left">What happens after the fight? Does the ambush trigger 
the opening of even deeper tunnels into the crypt? Does a living Olmstoy
 relative sue for damages? Might a collector of archaeological remains 
contact them for help identifying each of the bodies?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Thuranni Outpost</b></p>
<p align="left">When the heroes' patron asks them to investigate a 
war-blasted, abandoned jail on the eastern edge of what used to be Cyre,
 it soon becomes clear that House Thuranni uses the structure as a base 
of operations. Trained assassins or not, the party must reconnoiter if 
the patron says to reconnoiter, so they get themselves into a royal 
rumble soon after unlocking the main gate. This fight is all about 
position and reach -- with all the iron-barred doors and gates, locking 
obstacles can impede movement while ranged spells and attacks can fire 
away. Most of the Thuranni agents carry skeleton keys that unlock any of
 the gates, but the compound is not prepared for a full-on assault from 
outside, so many of the gates remain unlocked. Simple bunks and 
footlockers hide elaborate Thuranni daggers and scrying equipment. The 
party may need <i>light</i> spells, since the Thuranni elves' <i>darkness</i> effects may plunge the fight into a blind scrap.</p>
<p align="left">What led to this fight? Could someone posing as the 
party's patron have set a trap? Is House Phiarlan motivated to procure 
information about those other bearers of the Mark of Shadow? Does a 
mourning parent believe his son's remains are still hiding in the jail 
somewhere?</p>
<p align="left">What happens after the fight? Do the PCs chase off a 
relatively minor squad of Thuranni elves, or do they retreat after 
encountering a full-on assassins' fortress? Does the fight continue onto
 a hidden airship escape vehicle? Does the Big Bad Guy challenge the PCs
 to a final showdown in the jail's former torture chamber?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Mini-Hooks</b></p>
