<p align="LEFT">Welcome to the new Steal This Hook! I am very glad to add my contributions to this column. One of my favorite <b>D&amp;D </b>products ever produced was the <i>Dungeon Master Design Kit</i>,
 a veritable cornucopia of general ideas for rolling up adventure ideas 
randomly. So, adventure ideas are close to my heart, and I am glad to 
help DMs out there. I wish this resource was available back in the day 
when I ran home campaigns.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The column has been revamped and expanded a little. The 
revamping comes in the formats of the hooks. As you'll see, there are 
optional secret motivations suggested for the NPCs and different 
complications that you can throw into the adventure you design around 
the hook. (Remember to allow for appropriate checks; sometimes a person 
with bad intentions may give herself away!) It has been expanded into 
other campaign worlds as well, especially the <b>Forgotten Realms.</b> Each entry has a campaign adaptation sidebar for the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>, <b>Eberron</b>, a generic <b>D&amp;D</b> setting, and even the <b>d20 Modern</b> setting. So, off we go. This month's theme is "old mysteries," or things from the past that thrust their way into the present.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Lady of the Lake -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2003-13%20-%20Old%20Mysteries_files/dx0313sh_stealhook_lake.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="175" width="240">The
 Last War produced many casualties, not a few of them innocents. When 
Breland made its military push across Silver Lake and into what was then
 Aundair (now the Eldeen Reaches), a large number of farms were burned 
and small towns and villages destroyed. A few of these towns fended off 
the destructive Brelish by offering supplies, haven, or even the 
"services" of local women and men. In one of the villages near 
Greenblade, a local woman named Bristarra disappeared without a trace in
 early 955 YK. Bristarra was a beautiful girl training in the healing 
arts, and her whole village loved her. At the time, people blamed the 
Brelish and mourned her loss, but the outrage contributed even more to 
the growing desire to evict the Brelish military from the region.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now, troubling reports are circulating that people have 
seen Bristarra walking on the surface of Silver Lake. Ship captains have
 reported that either themselves or their crewpeople have seen a woman 
strolling serenely on the lake's water. Fisherpeople have reported 
seeing the same woman in the early dawn hours dancing on the waters. At 
night, she has been seen from the shore on the Eldeen Reaches side of 
the lake. She is growing into something of a local legend, though no one
 has ever gotten close enough to determine if she is a real woman, a 
spirit, or an elaborate illusion. Her father, Crennilius, is close to 
death and wants to know. He hires the adventurers to find this 
apparition and learn the truth about what happened to his daughter. Time
 is running out, though, because he could die any day now.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds.
 To make things more interesting on the waters of the lake, you might 
consider using material from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/178670000">Stormwrack</a></i>; for particularly difficult encounters, you might consider stocking the lake with drowned (<i>Monster Manual III</i>, pg. 46) -- considered by many a DM as very deadly undead.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Set it on the shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars, and change the Brelish military to pirates.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Set it in and around Silver Lake, as written.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> Use any lake large enough to have opposing military forces on both sides.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> Set this adventure on a lake in Scotland or Ireland, and use the British as the opposing military force.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 All is as it seems. Crennilius really wants to know what happened to his daughter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-80 Crennilius knows what happened to his daughter. He
 sold her to a Brelish captain, who discarded her when he was finished 
with her. Crennilius wants to know if this is really his daughter, 
because he doesn't want anyone to find out about his dark deed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Crennilius is afraid that his daughter has 
returned as an undead of some kind, something that she would never have 
wanted. He wants the adventurers to destroy her, but cannot bring 
himself to ask.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-30 Bristarra is a ghost caught between her good 
nature and a desire for revenge for how she died. The conflict within 
her explains why she has not attacked anyone yet. But soon she will.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-55 A great monster lives under the surface of the 
lake. It lurks near the apparition hoping for some prey from among those
 who come to investigate.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-75 Someone is using this local tragedy in a political
 ploy to stir up unrest between the inhabitants on each side of Silver 
Lake. He wants a war to break out here that will end the Thronehold 
peace.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Pirates are using the image of this girl as a 
mermaid of sorts, to lure ships to where they can be attacked. It should
 be noted that only ships that have not approached the apparition have 
been able to tell stories about it.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Gold in the Hills -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2003-13%20-%20Old%20Mysteries_files/dx0313sh_stealhook_mine.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="190" width="240">The
 ancient dwarven kingdom of Tethyamar once spanned the Desertsmouth 
Mountains on the western edge of Daggerdale. Several hundred years ago 
it fell to armies of monsters. About the same time that these armies 
began to threaten the dwarves, the king abandoned a few of the lesser 
mines on the Daggerdale side of the mountains because they were deemed 
to be completely worked out. Several persistent dwarves tried to get a 
little more, but even they gave up eventually. Through the next few 
hundred years, prospectors and adventurers that braved the monsters 
found that indeed these mines were empty of anything of value, and it 
became settled fact that the mines were worthless.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Within the last year, gold has started trickling out of 
one of the mines. The amounts have been steadily growing, as if the 
supply is actually replenishing itself. People are interested in what is
 happening in the old mine, and any of several people could hire 
adventurers to find out.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Employers and Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-25 Though the last king of Tethyamar died in 1369 DR,
 he had sons. One of these, Tasster, also called Fiendshredder, would 
like to claim the gold and use it to finance an effort to reclaim 
Tethyamar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">25-50 Residents of Daggerdale are very interested in 
this new source of wealth, and want their share. Some of them hire the 
adventurers to stake a claim on their behalf and clear the way to the 
mine of dangerous monsters.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds. To flesh out the dwarven angle, you might find <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/965670000">Races of Stone</a></i> useful. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Set it in the Ironroot Mountains, in the Mror Holds. You'll have to tweak the backstory a bit.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> Set it in any mountain range that could once have had a mine. The miners need not have been dwarves.</p>

<p align="LEFT">51-75 A scholar from Waterdeep has heard about the gold 
coming out of the abandoned mine, and he has come to the region to 
investigate. He wants protection and some help with the mystery, and he 
is willing to share whatever is found as a result of the quest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Most people who go to the mine do not return for 
one reason or another. One of the adventurers has a relative that has 
gone missing while searching for, or in, the mine.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-25 A mindbender wizard (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179250000">Complete Arcane</a></i>)
 is using magic to fill the mine with gold because gold attracts other 
creatures. He wants to enslave these creatures, who will be mentally 
weakened by greed, and create an army to march against Daggerdale.</p>
<p align="LEFT">26-65 Through a connection to the Underdark, some duergar have discovered the gold as well, and want it for themselves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-85 The gold is the work of Bane, or priests of Bane 
from the Zhentarim, who seek to destabilize the Dalelands with a sudden 
influx of wealth. The resultant chaos would allow the Zhentarim to take 
over trade or take over the region.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 The gold is natural and comes from a vein that a 
minor earthquake opened up. However, a mind flayer now occupies the mine
 and does not like all the company. He has been leaking out the gold 
through slaves, unaware of the history of the mine.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Necropolis in the Sands -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2003-13%20-%20Old%20Mysteries_files/dx0313sh_stealhook_desert.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="150" width="240">As
 the player characters are crossing the Calim Desert from Memnon to 
Calimport, they come across a family searching frantically for a lost 
child. The family's wagon broke a wheel here this morning, and the three
 adults (a man, his wife, and her brother) cannibalized some other wood 
to make repairs while the three children played nearby. The youngest 
child, eight-year-old Justinal, separated from the other two children 
and wandered off unnoticed. Everyone has been searching frantically for 
over an hour without success. The family asks the player characters to 
assist in the search. From the last location that Justinal was seen, any
 tracker that can make a DC 15 Survival check can find and follow 
Justinal's tracks. The difficulty is higher because a wind has erased 
some of the tracks in the hours since Justinal wandered off. His trail 
leads to a large and apparently deserted city about two hours' walk 
away. As the heroes reach the city gates themselves, darkness begins to 
fall.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Calim Desert is rumored to have several ruined 
cities within its sands, and this is one of them. The residents were all
 killed during the genie wars of centuries ago, and they have since 
become undead of different kinds. A lich has moved in and taken control 
of things. In short, the city is a necropolis, and many undead await 
within to feast on the bodies and souls of any intruders.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The family has no wealth to offer the heroes; they are poor travelers escaping persecution in Calimport.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-25 The family is setting a trap to lure the living 
into the necropolis so that undead can feed. Justinal is a zombie 
ordered to walk back toward the city to create a trail that can be 
followed. One of the adults is currently being possessed by a servant of
 the lich.</p>
<p align="LEFT">26-75 Everything is as it appears. The parents are 
careless and expected one of the other children to keep track of the 
younger ones.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 There is no Justinal. The parents want brave 
heroes to go into the necropolis and bring out its treasures. The 
parents then plan to waylay the weakened player characters and take the 
loot. The other children are slaves of the parents and obey out of fear.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-30 No complications.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-55 A lich has cast a spell on Justinal and called him
 to come to the city. The lich plans to make Justinal his apprentice and
 train him in the ways of evil from an early age.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-75 Justinal is actually a child of an important noble
 in Calimport, and he was kidnapped by this group. If he is returned 
safely, then the player characters may gain great reward or may be 
accused of kidnapping him in the first place.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 A rival lich or vampire sees in Justinal a chance 
to usurp the power of the lich. The player characters are caught in the 
middle as both sides try to use the child to their advantage and to the 
other's ruin.</p>
