Bad guys, especially, like to form alliances to accomplish common or 
related goals. These are usually short-term alliances, or they may be 
merely economic arrangements, but they bolster both sides because each 
can throw the other group against pesky adventurers. This month, 
consider these hooks that involve different groups either forming 
alliances or offering their services for such an alliance.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>"Dragon Turtle, for Barter Only" -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the far east of Khorvaire, the Lhazaar princes 
control the seas. Their ships patrol the waters, fighting independent 
pirates (for all Lhazaar princes descend somehow from pirates, either 
biologically or ideologically) and protecting their lands from 
incursions. However, groups in the Lhazaar islands seek to overthrow one
 or another prince. Sometimes these forces can be traced to other 
princes, sometimes to humanoids from Q'Barra or Valenar, and sometimes 
to independent pirates and smugglers that find the current status quo 
not favorable.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Bring this hook into your campaign. The <b>Forgotten Realms</b> product <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/965660000">Serpent Kingdoms</a></i> details the lives of lizardfolk in good detail. You might want to use blackscale or poison dusk lizardfolk from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179210000">Monster Manual III</a></i> instead of the standard variety. And <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/178670000">Stormwrack</a></i> should help with the sea-going parts of the adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> You could put this adventure in and around the Shining Sea, with the lizardfolk coming from the Jungles of Chult. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> A coastal area with several communities 
that could be at odds is what you need. It should have a place somewhere
 close where lizardfolk would live, but close is relative.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk: </b> This adventure works in the Sea of Gearnat and Relmor Bay, with the lizardfolk coming down from the Gnatmarsh.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern:</b> Dragon turtles are pretty rare in the 
modern world, but you could give the lizardfolk submarines that look 
like dragon turtles. Place the adventure off the coast of Japan and 
Australia, or near Seattle.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ravenloft:</b> The dragon turtles become skeletal 
dragon turtles or even dragon turtle dracoliches, and the lizardfolk 
could be mummified or vampiric. Set the adventure along the coast of 
Lamordia or Dementlieu (though I favor Lamordia).</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs are on a ship traveling somewhere in the 
southern Lhazaar Principalities when they see a strange sight. Several 
dragon turtles approach the ship. Since dragon turtles are dragons, the 
captain does not want to initiate hostilities, and his delay is very 
costly. The dragon turtles ram the ship, and dozens of lizardfolk 
warriors stream from hidden places in the shells and board the ship. The
 PCs are quickly fighting for their lives!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Should they survive, the ship probably won't. Once they 
have figured out rescue, the owners of the ship contact them and ask 
them to do something about the lizardfolk mercenaries. They have 
attacked other ships while the PCs were busy rescuing themselves.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-45 The ship owner, part of a faction in the Lhazaar 
Principalities, is sincere in wanting the lizardfolk stopped. He doesn't
 know anything besides the names of the captains of the other ships 
attacked and that these captains all belonged to part of the same 
faction.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-75 The lizardfolk were not supposed to attack the 
ship, since the ships owner is the one paying the lizardfolk to attack 
others. He has decided they are unreliable and wants the PCs to 
eliminate them (and thus destroy evidence of his activities).</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-90 A rival of the ship owner, possibly the prince, 
contacts the PCs too. This person wants the PCs to go against the ship 
owner and negotiate a pact with the lizardfolk.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The lizardfolk are looking long-term, and they 
want to overthrow a Lhazaar prince and claim his lands for their own. 
The current tactics are the beginnings of a years-long plot.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-65 A large tribe of lizardfolk from Q'Barra sees an 
opportunity in the endless conflicts, and they domesticated some dragon 
turtles that live in the seas near their homelands. They sell their 
services to any who can pay, and they are currently working for an 
independent pirate group that wants to cause chaos in the southern 
Principalities. </p>
<p align="LEFT">66-75 The tamed dragon turtles have infected wild ones 
with the desire to attack ships, and additional ships are being attacked
 by dragon turtles alone. Sorting out which ships are victims of the 
lizardfolk could be problematic.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-85 Two Lhazaar princes have both paid the lizardfolk,
 which results in the lizardfolk working against both princes (something
 they have no problem with).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-30%20-%20%27Let%27s%20Make%20a%20Deal%27_files/dx20070330_stealhook_hag.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="342" width="240">86-00
 The real power behind the lizardfolk is a pirate who is wanted for many
 crimes and would be killed if apprehended. This pirate is taking 
revenge on the princes, and she uses the lizardfolk as one means to that
 end.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Barge Hags -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The river Delimbiyr runs from the Nether Mountains south
 and west past the High Forest, the High Moor, and Daggerford to reach 
the Sword Coast. Though the Shining Falls near Loudwater prevent the 
whole length of it from being navigable, it is navigable from Loudwater 
to the coast and from above the falls to the headwaters. Thus, there is a
 lot of trade on the water, especially from Loudwater to the sea. River 
transport of goods is preferable from Loudwater, both because it's less 
expensive and because bandits haunt the road. However, the river has its
 share of dangers. Barge pirates operate from time to time below 
Loudwater, where they can hide in the High Moor between raids. Barge 
pirates are not usually a big problem; they strike once or twice and 
then disappear for some reason.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then, reports come in to Secomber and Loudwater of a new
 group of pirates that don't steal goods. Instead, they blockade the 
river and demand tolls to pass. As the days pass, both towns send out 
forces to eliminate these pirates, but these pirates seem to have magic 
(or luck, or good planning) on their side because the weather is always 
in their favor. Some are captured or killed, but the group is not 
stopped and barge/boat captains pay the tolls to move their vessels.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> This adventure would work well on the 
river border between Thrane and Karrnath, just north of Thronehold. If 
that's a little too close to civilization for you, move north to the 
border between Aundair and Karrnath.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> A waterway that is used for trade is the
 main requirement. You don't even need a swamp nearby, since you can 
have the hags living almost anywhere.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk:</b> The area north of Greyhawk City works well, as does the river that runs between Verbobonc and Dyvers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern:</b> Not all three kinds of hags appear in the
 modern world unless they are shadow creatures brought from somewhere 
else. But you can replace them with fey or medusa spellcasters. This 
adventure could be interesting along the Mississippi, but also along the
 Yangtze or the Nile or the Amazon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ravenloft:</b> The Musarde River in Richemulot is a 
good place for this adventure. It connects all the settlements of the 
domain, and the people in charge are all merchants.</p>

<p align="LEFT">In Secomber, a merchant named Sultai Orero has suffered 
too much loss to these new barge pirates, and she wants something done 
about it. Since the pirates are somehow evading the authorities on a 
regular basis, she thinks the authorities are not to be trusted and 
turns to adventurers. She is willing to offer a handsome reward -- and 
even a partnership with PCs who have a business inclination.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-55 Sultai is genuinely concerned about her business and is up front with the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-80 Sultai is not hiring the PCs at all. One of the 
hags (see below) impersonates her via magic and hires the PCs. The hags 
want to be rid of their "partners" and think this is the best way of 
severing the relationship.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Sultai wants revenge. She tried to make a deal 
with the pirates, but they refused, so she wants them eliminated. Her 
business is of secondary concern.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-30 The barge pirates don't have a wizard among them. 
They have made a deal with a hag covey that lives in the High Moor, and 
the hags provide weather control support, along with other spell support
 and even physical intervention, in exchange for half the proceeds. The 
hags use the money for some project that is not related to the barge 
pirates, and would find other ways of stealing the money if the barge 
pirates are eliminated.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-50 The hags are not real. Instead, they are the 
creation of a group of evil fey that lives in the High Moor. By this 
subterfuge, the fey protect themselves from discovery should the pirates
 be captured.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 A rival of Sultai's is taking advantage of the 
situation and having his captains pay the pirates to charge Sultai's 
vessels (or those carrying her cargoes) more. This rival hopes to drive 
her out of business without being personally involved.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Vessels that pay the pirates are still being 
attacked and destroyed from time to time. The hags use illusions, 
undead, and even river creatures to destroy boats that have cargoes they
 want.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>My Bugbear, My Friend -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-30%20-%20%27Let%27s%20Make%20a%20Deal%27_files/dx20070330_stealhook_bugbear.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="330" width="240">In
 Zilargo, near the Seawall Mountains, a lot of people move from place to
 place. A lightning rail line passes through the area, and House Orien 
trade roads connect the major gnomish settlements. In this area, from 
time to time, bandits operate. The trade caravans are well guarded, so 
travelers become the prime targets. One group of gnome bandits, called 
the Bloody Hawks, robs travelers throughout the region between Zolanberg
 and Korranberg. They usually rob on the trade roads, but they have hit 
the lightning rail line more than once. They never kill; always masked, 
they take valuables and leave their group's symbol behind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A week ago, a group of traveling merchants was 
slaughtered on the road between Tarandro and Thurimbar, and all their 
possessions taken. A Bloody Hawks sign was left at the scene. This 
caused the regional law enforcement agencies, who usually did not take 
much interest in the doings of the Bloody Hawks, to become more 
interested and to try to seek them out. Two days ago, another attack 
occurred, this time outside Zolanberg. There was one survivor, and he 
saw bugbears and gnomes working together to slaughter everyone else. 
Again, a Bloody Hawks sign was left at the scene.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs are in one of the towns in the region when they 
hear that Captain Osamonish of the guards seeks adventurers. Captain 
Osamonish relates that he lost his entire company to the bugbear and 
gnome bandits, and he needs help to track and eliminate them. He offers 
standard pay, but says that the bandits no doubt have a lot of loot, and
 if some of that was not returned it could be explained away easily.</p>

Use <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881580000">Savage Species</a></i> to make interesting types of bugbears (feral, insectile, reptilian, multiheaded, and even yuan-ti crossbreed variants). <i>Complete Scoundrel</i> could have a lot to help you flesh out the bandits.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> The Dalelands are a good place for this adventure, with bugbears living in the Thunder Peaks or the forest of Cormanthor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b> All you need for this is a city or town
 and a road that goes somewhere else that people use frequently. Some 
wilderness where bandits can hide is also helpful.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk:</b> This adventure works in the Duchy of 
Urnst, or even the County. There are a lot of merchants and people going
 here and there, and a kind of city-state mentality.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern:</b> Put the bugbears in SUVs or on motorcycles and you have something reminiscent of <i>Mad Max</i> (or maybe <i>The Road Warrior</i> ). Set the adventure in Australia, where the frontier is not far away but there are towns. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ravenloft: </b> The bandits and bugbears would be 
desperate characters in the Domain of Dread. You could even make them 
lycanthropes. Dementlieu and Invidia are good domain choices, though 
Falkovnia works too.</p>

stuff back, among other reasons).</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 The Bloody Hawks are not working with the bugbears
 (or aren't any more, depending on the complication below). The bugbears

 hire the PCs.</p>

which have the gnomes worried.</p>

Bloody Hawks to divert suspicion onto someone else for their raids. The 
bugbears are led by a gnome sorcerer or maybe a necromancer.</p>

stolen, including most of the lost company of guards. The lost patrol 
returns as zombies or ghouls and attacks the next caravan with the 
Hawks. Other bodies appear later on, or they appear guarding a base that
 the bugbears and/or Hawks are using.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The lost company of guards is the Bloody Hawks.
