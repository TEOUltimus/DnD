 a wealthy maven dies, and instead of leaving her estate to friends, 
family, or public trusts, she chooses to will everything to a beloved 
pet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Recently, it has happened again. Caroline Blackcatter, 
minor sorcerer and heiress to a family business manufacturing rare spell
 components, passed away at the venerable age of 92. According to 
executors, the entirety of her fortune went to her familiar, Mister 
Pipkins, including substantial funding set aside for the cat's care and 
protection.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While arousing smirks and smiles from <i>Sharn Inquisitive</i>
 readers, not everyone is so enamored with the story. One of the 
provisions of the will is that if should anything befall Mister Pipkins,
 the fortune will pass on to Bartlemeus Burrlacher, chief executor of 
the estate. Naturally, Burrlacher cannot be associated with any attempt 
to do away with the cat . . . however, furtive associates of his 
approach the party, suggesting the cat's death would greatly benefit 
them all. Through the most transparent implications, they make it clear 
that Burrlacher needs a discreet, professional -- and unaffiliated -- 
party to break into the Blackcatter estate, where they must locate and 
assassinate Mister Pipkins. Once the Blackcatter fortune passes to 
Burrlacher, the party will be handsomely paid; in addition, should they 
stage their assassination attempt as a burglary, any objects they secure
 along the way are theirs to keep.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-40 Burrlacher is what he says: a greedy man in need 
of one less cat, in order to gain possession of the fortune he has 
managed for years.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-75 Burrlacher is still working for the estate; the 
fortune will not pass to him if the cat dies, but rather to a distant 
relative. Only if the cat lives long enough to die at a ripe old age of 
natural causes will Burrlacher be rewarded. Thus, he hires the party to 
test the estate's defenses and guards. He'll be waiting in the final 
study along with the cat -- and a heavy contingency of guards -- to 
reveal himself to the PCs and escort them out.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Caroline Blackcatter did not actually pass away. 
She has taken the guise of her cat to see which of her staff she can 
really trust, before completing her actual will. She'll reveal herself 
to the PCs when necessary and solicit the name of their employer. If 
things turn heated, she will certainly defend herself.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-60 The Blackcatter estate is by no means 
ill-defended. From topiary guardians in the gardens, to zealous 
bodyguards, to the cat itself -- well-protected by a nigh-impenetrable 
arsenal of defensive spells (this is truly a cat that could walk through
 walls) -- this is not an easy contract to fulfill.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-90 Further protecting the cat, a number of local 
police have infiltrated the estate, posing as bodyguards. Due to the 
provisions of the will (if the provisions do indeed benefit Burrlacher),
 they've suspected Burrlacher would send assassins against the cat, 
which they've vowed to thwart.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The familiar, as it turns out, is no mere cat (if 
the third motivation above isn't used). Rather, it's a rakshasa that 
stays in the guise of a familiar in order to work incognito. The 
rakshasa has managed the estate for years, using Caroline Blackcatter 
for cover, and it composed her will itself. Needless to say, now that it
 has come directly into her fortune, it has no intention of seeing it 
taken away -- or its identity revealed.</p>

<p align="LEFT"> Amn is an ancient land and home to a great many 
wizards. Each is trying to outdo his or her fellows in power or 
uniqueness of new items or any other measure that they can think of. In 
Murann, on the coast, one of the wizards has made a true advancement in 
the construction of golems. This wizard, Chayosa Tuwese, has created a 
golem with some real intelligence, and yet with the usual immunities to 
mental effects. She guards this secret closely and has created only a 
few of these new golems to guard her tower.</p>
<p align="LEFT">No matter how closely one guards a secret, someone else 
finds out. In this case, a rival mystic theurge has found out about the 
new golems. This man, Blaseus Eldmelm, knows that Chayosa has made 
something really powerful but he doesn't know the properties of the new 
creature. He'd like to, so he seeks out some suitable 
mercenaries/thieves/adventurers to break into Chayosa's tower and steal 
one of the golems, intact and functioning. In return for the golem, 
Blaseus is willing to offer access to magical training (spells and 
feats) that the PCs don't normally have access to. For those not of a 
magical bent, he can arrange through contacts for other kinds of 
training. He can also offer a map to a supposed treasure that he never 
got around to following up on when he was an adventurer.</p>

<p align="LEFT">00-30 Blaseus is sincere in what he says. He does not 
say what he wants to do with the golem, because it's not really the PCs'
 business anyway.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-50 Blaseus is actually an employee of Chayosa, who 
wants someone to try to break into her house so she can see how well her
 new golems function. She plans to kill the intruding PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 Chayosa wants to fake her own death, and what 
better way than at the hands of mercenaries? She leaked the information 
about the golems, knowing Blaseus would find it irresistible.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Blaseus plans to kill the PCs rather than pay 
them, but he gives them enough real information to get them into trouble
 (and then enough false information that they cannot get out). The whole
 golem thing is a ruse; Blaseus has a lasting grudge against the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-40 Someone else has hired adventurers or thieves for 
the same purpose (stealing a golem), and the PCs encounter their rivals 
in the tower. The rivals are hostile to the PCs initially.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-55 Chayosa is dead, slain by her new creations. Now they wander the tower at random, killing anything that moves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-75 Chayosa's new golems are created in such a way 
that the animating spirit comes from a human instead of an elemental or 
wherever. Thus, the golems have some intelligence and cunning, and yet 
they retain their mental immunities. The golems use weapons and tactics.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Blaseus has alerted the local law enforcement to 
the PCs' plans, in case they make it out alive. Law enforcement officers
 will be waiting for the PCs upon their departure.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>"I had that around here somewhere . . ." -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Arcanix, on the shores of Lake Galifar in Aundair, is a 
center for arcane studies that attracts dozens of apprentices each year 
and more than a few wizardly residents. Some live in the floating towers
 of the Arcane Congress, but many live in the village (on the ground) 
and try to benefit from being near the Arcane Congress. Because of this 
concentration of magical knowledge, and students thereof, rare magical 
happenings are not paid much attention to.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Yesterday, a wizard named Rasamiri Nyss, who has a reputation for absentmindedness, lent her <i>rod of wonder</i>
 to a fellow wizard named Lerat Den'dra, and thieves stole it from him. 
He did not mention the theft to Rasamiri, and she forgot that she loaned
 the rod out at all.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Last night, the people in the marketplace and tavern 
areas of Arcanix were treated to the most varied magical display they 
had ever seen. Swaths of grass covered stony areas, objects disappeared,
 people turned green, and an occasional lightning bolt ripped through 
the area wounding or killing some people. The PCs may have been out in 
the marketplace and witnessed some strange effect (use the <i>rod of wonder</i> table [<i>DMG</i>
 237] to generate random effects). They could not find the source, 
however, even for projected effects like streams of butterflies. Some 
assumed that apprentices were playing games on each other, but others 
muttered about dark magic and doom coming upon everyone in the village.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Some of the wizards in the village, and even up at the 
Arcane Congress, have evil ambitions. One of these (you get to make up 
the name this time) contacts the PCs. He thinks that a <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20060807a">rod of wonder</a></i>
 is being used, and the only person in the village with one is Rasamiri.
 This wizard wants the rod for himself and Rasamiri dead, and he is 
willing to pay handsomely.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-35 The patron wizard is sincere, and he is not holding back anything.</p>
<p align="LEFT">36-70 The patron wizard hopes the PCs will be killed on 
the mission (and another lackey of his would collect the rod), but he is
 otherwise sincere and not planning any direct harm to the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-90 The patron wizard has hired some assassins to take
 out the PCs as soon as they have the rod and right after their battle 
with Rasamiri.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 Rasamiri leads a double life and is the patron 
wizard in disguise. If the PCs agree to take her job, then she knows 
they are evil and will slay them when they try to slay her. She will be 
well prepared when they arrive to attack her.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-40 A group of thieves has the <i>rod of wonder</i> 
and was testing it out last night. They discovered its unfortunate as 
well as beneficial effects (after turning a favorite tavern ethereal). 
They now plan to use it to cover up their robberies and don't want to 
part with it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-50 The <i>rod of wonder</i> has a side effect that 
makes its wielder invisible whenever it is carried with the intent to 
use it. That is why no one could trace the source of the effects last 
night. That and the fact that the wielder was moving all the time. Thus,
 the rod hides itself by hiding its wielder.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-65 The <i>rod of wonder</i> has a side-effect curse 
attached to it. The wielder becomes progressively more evil and more 
paranoid with each use. The thief wielding it has been twisted quite a 
bit after last night's tests. The paranoia leads to more protections 
against the rod being stolen, making the PCs' job harder.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-80 The <i>rod of wonder</i> has a curse attached to 
it. If it is stolen and the thief attempts to use it, the rod works 
normally but a random monster is summoned from the <i>summon monster I-VII</i>
 spell tables. The rod attacks the wielder unless the wielder is 
invisible, in which case it seeks out random targets. Last night's tests
 were accompanied by a lot of summoned monster attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Other parties are interested in the rod. Rasamiri 
is the only known owner of such an item in the whole area, and any 
wizard that figures out the origin of the effects knows it is hers. Some
 want it out of her (or anyone's) hands, while others just want it for 
themselves. These parties either try to steal the rod from the PCs (or 
hire someone to do so), or try to negotiate with the PCs to get the rod.
 Somehow everyone knows that the PCs are on the job (divination magic is
 amazing, isn't it?).</p>

<p align="LEFT"> Westgate, home of the Night Masks, is a city known for 
thieves and scoundrels. The Night Masks used to hold uncontested sway 
over the city's illegal activities, but with the death of the Faceless, 
smaller guilds have cropped up from time to time. These guilds are 
pursued relentlessly by local heroes and law enforcement, because they 
are easier to remove than the Night Masks (which survive under different
 leadership).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Complete Scoundrel</i> is your friend for this hook, since thieves abound. You might also find <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/955647200">Complete Champion</a></i> useful, but you have to wait until May for it. Westgate is published in <b>Forgotten Realms</b> products, or you can use <i>Cityscape</i> to place the adventure in another city.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Sharn is an obvious choice for this 
adventure. Perhaps too obvious. Fairhaven in Aundair is a good alternate
 choice. You could even set it in Stormreach (on Xen'drik).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b> A city with some thieves' guilds is what you need. Easy, huh?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk:</b> Set this in Greyhawk City itself. Other
 cities will work just fine, but the Free City has a lot of different 
thief elements you can work in to complicate matters (including racial 
issues with Rhenee thieves).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern:</b> A city with some thieves' guilds . . . 
oh, yeah. See above. In the modern world these are crime cartels or 
mafias or something like that. Try New York City.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Then reports filter through the taverns that the heroic 
paladin Zalah Mystof, who was known for tracking and arresting thieves, 
has begun killing them off instead. They are just rumors, but the 
killings become more frequent and witnesses say they saw Zalah in the 
area or even witnessed him slaughtering thieves that had surrendered.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Needless to say, the smaller guilds that are the target 
of Zalah's zeal are very nervous, and they look for mercenaries to kill 
the paladin as quickly as possible. The PCs could be hired by several 
different guilds and collect money for the same job from all these 
patrons -- if they can find and kill the paladin.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-00 No tricky motivations here; everyone wants the paladin Zalah dead as soon as possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-50 The Zalah that is killing the thieves is an evil 
duplicate of the real Zalah, who was slain by the duplicate. Zalah ran 
into a <i>mirror of opposition</i> trap when pursuing a group of 
thieves, and the mirror's duplicate slew him. Then it began slaying 
thieves, because it is still Zalah (just evil).</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-60 Zalah is under the mental control of the new 
leader of the Night Masks, and he is being used to clear out the smaller
 gangs permanently. Should the PCs break the mental control, they can 
get Zalah to lead them back to at least some members of the Night Masks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-85 The evil Zalah has created himself a lair in the 
sewers under Westgate (all cities in the Realms with great thieves' 
guilds have sewers). He has not placed any guardian creatures himself, 
but some nasty water-dwelling monsters have moved in.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 Zalah is not evil at all; he slew the evil 
duplicate because it was deadlier than himself. He gave up arresting 
thieves because it did no good. Now he is adamant about killing thieves.</p>
