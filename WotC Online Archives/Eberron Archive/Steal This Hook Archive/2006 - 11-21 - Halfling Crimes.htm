 seems that halflings get a bad reputation when they live in 
human-dominated areas. Crimes are always blamed on them. Do halflings 
turn to crime because the crimes are blamed on them anyway, or are the 
crimes blamed on halflings in general because a lot of crimes are 
committed by halflings? After all, the favored class for halfling is 
rogue. This month, we further this distressing stereotype by looking at 
some hooks involving halflings and crime.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Fund Raiser</b> -- <i>Eberron</i></p>
<p> Wroat, the capital of Breland, is not as large or as "active" as 
Sharn, but it is nonetheless a center of trade and commerce as well as 
the center of the Brelish government. Merchants who have offices in 
Sharn also have them in Wroat, because the presence of so many officials
 and aristocrats holds the promise of lucrative business. Honest 
businesspeople are not the only ones who think so, either. A couple of 
weeks ago, some group stole all of the jewelry in the locked storerooms 
of the Devirr family jewelers. The next night, the home of a scion of 
House Orien was robbed, and more than 10,000 gp worth of goods were 
taken. And so it continued until the present. Every night brought 
another robbery, and thousands of gold worth of goods disappeared into 
nowhere.</p>
<p>It was not until the night before last that anyone had a clue as to 
the identity of the thieves. Some adventurers, out for a night of fun, 
came out of a tavern and walked (or staggered) back to their lodgings. 
On the way, they saw a group of halflings come out of the back of a 
warehouse carrying bags. The halflings quickly lost the adventurers and 
disappeared into sewer holes and other small places where the larger 
folk could not follow.</p>
<p>Wroat has some known "thieves' guilds," and the thefts were only 
surprising in their frequency, audacity, and in the amount that was 
taken. The royal guard and the city watch both keep track of groups of 
known thieves and roots them out where possible. But the groups don't 
disappear completely, and so everyone relies on a kind of code of honor 
to avoid losing too much (the thieves enjoy less vigorous attempts to 
root them out if they steal with restraint, and they sometimes bribe the
 watch). But this amount of thief activity is making the merchants and 
aristocrats angry, and they are demanding that something be done about 
the "thief problem."</p>
<p>Captain Rand d'Medani, a cunning half-elf who has risen to this 
position through effort rather than connections, thinks that something 
is going on behind the scenes, so to speak, and he'd like to know what 
that is before cracking down on halfling guilds. Because city watch 
personnel are usually terrible at streetwork and infiltration, he hires 
the adventurers for 20 gp per day, plus hazard pay if things get really 
dangerous. In addition, they can keep, without reporting to him, 
anything that they happen to find that is not part of the stolen items 
from the recent string of robberies.</p>

<p><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Go for Waterdeep with this adventure hook. 
There is a lot written about Waterdeep, though, so you'll have to 
exercise some care in inserting these halflings.</p>

 If you don't want to use them, you can use medusas or kobolds or even 
well-built robots working for mad scientists. The important thing is 
that someone needs a lot of cash right now. Consider a national capital

Brazil), or London.</p>

<p><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p>01-35 Rand d'Medani is on the up-and-up, and provides what assistance he can in a covert manner.</p>
<p>36-80 Rand d'Medani knows who is perpetrating the robberies (though 
he won't tell the adventurers outright), but he really doesn't know why.
 He wants to know, so that he can possibly use that knowledge to his own
 benefit. Rand is not above making a gold or 100 on the side.</p>
<p>81-00 Rand d'Medani is a member of sorts of the halfling burglars, or
 a close friend, and helps them in exchange for a small cut. However, he
 is feeling the pressure to eradicate the robbers, and pressure from the
 aristocracy cannot be ignored. He doesn't know quite how to handle the 
situation to keep the status quo.</p>
<p><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p>01-30 The halflings need the money to placate an enemy group that 
threatens their homeland. Should the adventurers find this out, they 
have to deal with agents of that enemy group and his aberration lackeys.</p>
<p>31-55 The halflings are innocent; someone is pinning the crimes on them.</p>
<p>56-75 There are no halflings at all. The supposed halflings are 
actually transformed demons or devils trying to raise money to use in 
corrupting important mortals.</p>
<p>76-00 The stolen goods have already been moved out of the city and to
 somewhere else. The people pushing for the investigation really want 
their stuff back more than they want any perpetrators caught, and any 
solution that does not involve the recovery of all stolen goods is not 
acceptable. The goods could be dispersed in merchant caravans by now 
going to the far corners of the world, or they could be in the lair of a
 black dragon . . .</p>
<p class="size3"><b>The Three Hagsketeers</b> -- <i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>

 Tethyr, a recovering power along the western coast of Faerûn, is home 
to a number of halflings as well as the dominant humans. Some halflings 
live in the large cities, and others live in their own communities near 
to the big cities but still far enough away to maintain the halflings' 
more rural way of life. One such community, near to Saradush and the 
Forest of Mir, is having troubles that are not its fault.</p>
<p>Along the Zazesspur-Saradush trade route, people have started 
disappearing. Reports of robberies have also trickled in. The victims 
are usually lone travelers or small groups of travelers, but two 
merchant caravans have been attacked. One drove off the attackers, and 
one was lost completely. Among the victims, the reports are the same: a 
trio of halflings leads a group of monsters in the attacks.</p>
<p>Unrest has grown against the halfling community near Saradush, called
 Lydeskin's Grotto, because everyone who can describe the halfling 
villains describes a different set of halflings. Thus, the people are 
beginning to believe that everyone in the halfling community is 
involved. This has all the halflings of the land worried, because it is a
 short step from blaming one settlement to driving all halflings out of 
the country. In desperation, halflings from Lydeskin's Grotto have begun
 looking for mercenaries or adventurers or do-gooders who can help 
uncover what is really behind the crimes.</p>

<p><b>Eberron:</b> Set this adventure in western Breland, near 
Shavalant. The people there already dislike Cyran refugees, and you can 
probably link the halfling community to Cyre in some way to drive the 
adventure into even more dangerous paths.</p>

near to a trade route or trade center, and a forest or some such monster
 abode close enough to provide any monsters that you need.</p>

 campaigns, but halflings might be strange enough that they would garner
 suspicion just for being themselves, and that would help immensely. You
 could use any shapechanging monster instead of hags. This probably 
would go over well in Ireland or Wales, but it might be interesting in 
Eastern Europe or southern Africa, too.</p>

<p><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p>01-35 The PCs are approached by three halflings, who are really hags 
in shapechanged form. They are behind the crimes and want the inevitable
 investigators not to suspect them.</p>
<p>36-60 Unrest against all halflings is growing rapidly, and there are 
some who would hire the PCs to eradicate any halflings they happen to 
find. ("If you get them all, you'll probably get the guilty ones.")</p>
<p>61-90 The beleaguered halflings really need help, since they are likely to be driven out of the land or killed soon.</p>
<p>91-00 The halflings really are behind the crimes; they are working in
 association with a trio of hags to disrupt trade so that they can 
charge protection money.</p>
<p><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p>01-65 A trio of shapechanged halflings is committing the crimes, 
using different looks each time. They are not trying to bring trouble to
 Lydeskin's Grotto specifically; they just like blaming their crimes on 
halflings. They have some ogres in tow.</p>
<p>66-90 The trail of the villains leads into the Forest of Mir, which 
is populated by two elven tribes as well as evil goblinkind, trolls, and
 ogres.</p>
<p>91-95 There is a decaying <i>mythal</i> in the north part of the Forest of Mir, and the villains use its effects to throw off pursuers (the <i>mythal</i> turns helpful magic into harmful magic).</p>
<p>96-00 The hags actually work for a great power, such as a green 
dragon or a group of drow. A green dragon might have greenspawn 
razorfiends and greenspawn sneaks working for it.</p>

<p><b>Possible Rewards</b></p>
<p>Because different groups could hire the adventurers, there are 
different possible rewards available. Residents of Sembia understand 
that there are valuable things besides money, and also that some of 
those valuable things don't cost as much as others do.</p>
<p><b>Hired by the City Guard:</b> The city guard has a number of things it can offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can offer to overlook some crimes that the PCs might commit in the future (for whatever reason).</li>
<li>It could offer to help secure the early release of a friend of the PCs who was incarcerated (or will be).</li>
<li>Certain guards could have information of value to the adventurers 
while they are in Selgaunt. For example, if their real mission here 
involves some noble house, some of the guards might have inside 
information and diagrams of the noble's house and businesses.</li>
<li>Some guards might be able to provide an introduction for the PCs to a noble who could become their patron while in the city.</li>
<li>And of course, they can just pay the reward on Drayer.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hired by the Crimson Daggers:</b> The Crimson Daggers have the least to offer, but they can still make a good bargain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Crimson Daggers are loathe to part with money, but they are not 
loathe to part with treasure maps to distant locales that they will 
never visit. They could have a map that leads to treasure anywhere in 
your campaign world that you want to send the PCs next.</li>
<li>The Crimson Daggers are in the protection business, and they could 
offer to shadow the PCs and "make sure they're safe" while in the city. 
This means that they will try not to let anyone else kill the PCs, but 
won't promise not to kill them themselves.</li>
<li>Members of the Crimson Daggers know people, and they could connect 
the PCs with someone who could sell them things they cannot get in the 
regular markets.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hired by the Shadow Knives:</b> The Shadow Knives would rather 
just use the PCs and kill them, and they may well try to do that, but 
they do have to offer something to entice the PCs to take the job.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Shadow Knives are connected to mages, and especially 
necromancers. They can offer unknown or rare spells to the PC 
spellcasters.</li>
<li>The Shadow Knives are connected through bribery to the Hulorn (the 
ruler of Selgaunt), and they can offer his personal attention and 
patronage if the PCs are successful.</li>
<li>The Shadow Knives have acquired a number of properties in the 
distant parts of Sembia, and they can offer one of these to the PCs as 
payment. This plot of land could be a harmless farm, or a ruined estate 
with a monster-filled dungeon.</li>
<li>The Shadow Knives can offer the PCs their lives. In short, once the 
PCs complete the mission, the Shadow Knives set up a situation where 
they could clearly kill the PCs, and then offer mercy and drive the PCs 
out of Selgaunt instead.</li>

<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-21%20-%20Halfling%20Crimes_files/dx20061121_halfling3.jpg" align="right" border="0">Drayer
 Minoe is known to Selgaunt in many guises. Unfortunately, the one that 
mattered was exposed because of inept associates: Drayer is a master 
thief. A lot of thieves operate in Selgaunt, as one would expect of the 
largest merchant city in Sembia, but Drayer has been connected to 
several very important crimes. Further, he had angered both the city 
authorities and two rival thief groups, and they all want him dead. The 
sticking point is that they all want to kill him themselves and make 
sure the body is never found.</p>
<p>Some see Drayer as a dashing scion of the nobility, some as a quiet 
philosopher, and some as a dexterous circus performer. He has much in 
common with the halflings he has befriended in Selgaunt, except his 
height: He is nearly 6 feet tall. Using magic, his halfling friends 
slipped him out of town with one of their caravans, and if his disguise 
magic had not failed six days later, he would be home free. But it did, 
and someone reported his whereabouts to different parties in Selgaunt 
(collecting fees every time). Thus, there are a number of people who 
would hire adventurers to track down this halfling caravan and bring 
Drayer Minoe back to Selgaunt (but not necessarily to the law).</p>
<p>There is only one problem. The halfling caravan has disappeared since
 it was reported to those in Selgaunt. As in, without a trace. The 
adventurers discover this when they try to find it.</p>
<p><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p>01-35 The Selgaunt city guards want Drayer because he is an 
independent in a city where the guilds all bribe the guard for freedom 
to operate (within limits). Free agents are rooted out as soon as 
possible lest they disturb the delicate balance of money flow into the 
pockets of the guards. They claim that they want him because he is a 
criminal, though, and that he must be brought to justice. If the 
adventurers turn Drayer over to the guards, he is executed as a pirate 
on trumped-up charges and his body "lost" forever.</p>
<p>36-70 The Crimson Daggers, a small but effective thieves' guild, want
 Drayer because he stole from a noble that paid the Crimson Daggers for 
protection. Thus, the Crimson Daggers look bad and may lose business, 
and the noble is demanding that the Daggers make good on what was 
stolen. They claim that they want back what Drayer stole, and don't need
 Drayer himself, but that having Drayer would go a long way toward 
shoring up their business interests. Drayer would be sold into slavery 
if brought to these people.</p>
<p>71-00 A much larger guild, the Shadow Knives, wants Drayer for quite a
 different reason -- they want the information he has on all the 
families and merchants, and plan on ripping it out of his mind. After 
that, who knows? They claim, however, that they want to offer Drayer 
asylum and a way to continue to live in Selgaunt. If the heroes turn 
Drayer over to this party, then he ends up a mindless undead protecting 
some necromancer's private lab.</p>

<p>01-30 The halfling caravan passed a little too close to a place at 
the edge of the Arch Wood where a Cult of the Dragon operation was in 
the planning stages. The cultists, led by greenspawn razorfiends (see <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953767200"><i>Monster Manual IV</i></a>),
 decimated the caravan and took a number of prisoners (including Drayer 
Minoe). These prisoners are destined for some vile use by the leaders of
 the Cult unless the adventurers rescue them.</p>
<p>31-55 The caravan was detoured off the main road and passed through a <i>portal</i> to the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060620a&amp;page=3">Abyssal Plane of Spirac</a>. The halflings and Drayer Minoe know they are in trouble, but the <i>portal</i>
 was one-way and they cannot return unless someone finds them and helps.
 Spirac is the Abyssal hunting ground, and there are a lot of demons 
that would love to hunt human adventurers.</p>
<p>56-75 The caravan was a ruse the whole time, concocted by someone who
 wanted to capture Drayer for her own reasons. Possibly this was a 
former scorned lover seeking revenge or to twist Drayer's love toward 
her again. Fiendish DMs might make the lover a succubus or a lilitu (see
 page 43 of <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953757200"><i>Fiendish Codex I</i></a>).
 The halflings were hired for the part, and the wagons contained only 
false goods or were empty. They were ditched in Ordulin, where Drayer 
and his lover capturer may still be.</p>
<p>76-00 Drayer Minoe is also a master murderer, and one night after 
making friends with everyone and gaining their trust he murdered 
everyone in the caravan and buried their bodies in the Arch Wood. He hid
 the wagons and set off on foot through the Arch Wood into Archendale,
