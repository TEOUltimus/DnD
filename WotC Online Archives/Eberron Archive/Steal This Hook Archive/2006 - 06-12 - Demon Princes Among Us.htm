<p align="LEFT">Red and black skin, wings and sharp teeth. Heated breath
 and flames emanating from the creature before you. That's the idealized
 description of a demon from the pits of the Abyss, and what this 
month's set of adventure ideas is all about: Demons. Of course, they 
don't all look like that. Some are made of weird tentacles and fungus 
parts, some are oozy, some are stunningly beautiful. But they all mean 
harm to mortals for one reason or another. Even evil mortals should 
beware dealing with them, for unlike devils they have no conception of 
keeping their word. This month, we look at a trio of very different 
adventure ideas in which demon lords play important roles.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Where Are My Musicians? -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2006-12%20-%20Demon%20Princes%20Among%20Us_files/dx0612sh_stealthishook_grazzt.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="275" width="240">Some
 matters are settled with combat while others can be settled in more 
peaceful ways... such is the case in a dispute between halflings and 
grigs about which is the better fiddler. Though the halfling homeland is
 south in Luiren, there are halflings living all across Faerûn. A troupe
 of halfling bards settled in Essembra, the most populous city in 
Battledale, where they quickly gained a reputation for their music, 
especially their playing of fiddles. The local grigs became jealous, or 
bored (it's hard to say which with a grig), and challenged the halfling 
troupe to a contest to determine the best fiddlers of the dale. The 
grigs and halflings would meet in the central square of Essembra and 
play for the people, and the people would choose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">However, with everyone waiting and the grigs getting 
restless, the halflings have failed to show up. The grigs claim that 
they knew they would be beaten, but there are others in town who know 
that the Halflings would never choose to miss a musical contest. The 
bards' biggest fan, retired Purple Dragon Knight Kisthin Amadals, asks 
the heroes to find out what happened to the halflings. He had booked 
them to play at a party at his mansion the following evening, and hopes 
the heroes can find them in time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So what did happen to them? Fame could be said to be the
 root of their current predicament. The ancient city of Myth Drannor is 
somewhat close to Essembra, a city rife with drow and demons and what 
have you. Recently, an aspect of Graz'zt was sent to work with the 
surface drow as a sign of a an apparent (if temporary) alliance with 
Lolth. In truth, Graz'zt seeks to turn the drow to his own service, or 
at least make good use of them. The aspect found conditions intolerable,
 and set about making himself comfortable in his new home. Comfort -- 
for an aspect of Graz'zt -- includes every kind of decadence, with music
 naturally being one excess that must be plumbed to its depths. The 
aspect heard about the halfling bards, and had them abducted just before
 the competition. They are now trapped somewhere close to Myth Drannor, 
forced to do things with music that it is best not to talk about.</p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="240" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds. You'll want to get a copy of <i>Fiendish Codex I</i>
 to flesh out the demons you'll use, especially since it includes the 
statistics for Graz'zt. Any of the Myth Drannor publications should help
 too, as well as <i>Races of the Wild</i> for the elves that live in the vicinity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms</b>: Set around Myth Drannor, as written.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron</b>: Set this adventure in the Eldeen 
Reaches. The Twilight Demesne would serve as home for the grigs, and the
 Gloaming could be where the aspect of Graz'zt is based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic</b>: You can really set this adventure anywhere there might be grigs living in your campaign world.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern</b>: There are probably only grigs in 
England, Wales, Ireland, or Scotland, if there are any at all. But you 
could make the sides into two opposing rock bands and have the adventure
 in Australia or the United States. The aspects convert easily to Modern
 Earth.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-50 Kisthin Amadals really is concerned, though he 
expects he has to find another group for his party. However, he feels 
some obligation to have the bards tracked down, in case they are in 
trouble.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 51-70 Kisthin Amadals is not a Purple Dragon Knight at 
all, but a slaver working for Thayans. He had planned to sell the bards 
into slavery, and used the party as an excuse to get them to his mansion
 so that they could be caught.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 71-00 The grigs, who are being blamed by a large number
 of townsfolk ("You can't trust them damned faeries!"), also seek out 
the heroes for help, to clear their names and possibly avoid sudden 
vigilante-style justice.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-30 Myth Drannor offers its own complications, 
ranging from drow to demons to other nasty monsters. The adventures 
should have great difficulty operating within a few miles of the place. 
Maps of the great dungeon might be available to help them, and they 
could use the maps later for additional adventures.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 31-50 Aspects of Graz'zt are as seductive as succubi, 
and would try to ensnare the heroes in a web of sensuality that diverts 
them from their real intentions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 51-75 Drow unhappy with the presence of the aspect of Graz'zt might be willing to help the adventurers... for a price.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 76-00 A fearsome half-fiend green dragon has also made 
its home in the area, and likes to snack on halflings. Indeed, one of 
the bards was already lost to it. Dragon parts are always valuable, even
 if halflings are not.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Gnomelantis -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>

 before the Kingdom of Galifar arose on Khorvaire, the other kingdoms of
 the continent had grown and faded. The gnomes of Zilargo had, in the 
past, advanced their borders northward into what is now Breland by 
establishing a city called Yerosin on an island in the middle of Lake 
Brey. There, the Zil could better watch what other nations were doing, 
and there their wizards studied advanced magic away from the general 
population.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That all came to an end when the island and the city of 
Yerosin disappeared. In one night, the island was gone and the city 
along with it. No warning came, and it was some time before the loss was
 discovered because no one could get a communication out before the 
devastation hit. For millennia people have wondered what happened to 
Yerosin, but the city was forgotten by all but the gnomes who keep the 
records of their history in Zilargo.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A week or two ago, a small ship carrying valuable cargo 
was sailing across Lake Brey when it capsized and sank. Two of the 
sailors, who had water breathing magic, went down with the ship so that 
they could report its location. They returned with a story of a 
fantastic city of glowing lights and ghostly gnomish forms at the bottom
 of Lake Brey. Yerosin had been found at last. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Such a find attracts attention from treasure hunters and
 scholars alike, and the scholars of Morgrave University knew they had 
to get a jump on everyone, or else valuable clues to the fate of the 
city could be lost. They quickly hired adventurers to go to the site and
 find answers.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Yerosin suffered a great magical calamity that resulted 
in the island sinking to the depths of the lake, weirdly preserving 
everyone in a kind of stasis. Gnomes stand as if they frozen in time 
while walking the streets; in fact, in the midst of all activities. 
Active spells are frozen too, creating very unusual perpetual illusions.
 Some spells have taken on life of their own and become living spells, 
though a living major image wanders around without hurting anyone. Many 
of the treasures of the gnomes have been looted by underwater creatures 
over the centuries, but many other treasures remain in hidden places.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The city has not been left idle in all these centuries. 
Different lake creatures have laired near it from time to time, and even
 a lich called it home for a time during the early years of the Last 
War. Now it's the home of a group of sea hags, aquatic demons and 
aquatic ogres that worship the ancient demon prince Dagon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This area can be a suitable for a small adventure, or 
can open up a whole mini-campaign as the adventurers explore the city, 
fight the monsters there, and eventually try to raise it to the surface.
 It could even turn out that the original sinking of Yerosin was due to 
some pact with Dagon that must be undone.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-50 Morgrave University is serious about its aims, though it would really like any recovered artifacts as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 51-70 Scholars from the Library at Korranberg would 
also like to know about the lost city, and will pay the adventurers for a
 copy of whatever information they find. This would violate their 
contract with Morgrave University, but will make them very rich.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 71-00 The gnomes of Zilargo are very interested in 
their lost city as well, but don't want any humans poking around there 
without responsible gnomes as guides.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-35 Other creatures live in the lake, and they are hungry.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 36-55 An aspect of Dagon has recently appeared among 
the sea hags, in response to the discovery of the city by the surface 
folk. Its goal is to protect Dagon's worshippers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 56-70 An aspect of the Faceless Lord, Juiblex, has 
appeared here as well, to oppose the efforts of the aspect of Dagon and 
claim the underwater world and its treasures for its dread master.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 71-00 The magic that brought down the city could be 
undone, and that would cause the city to rise and everything in it to 
return to life. The rising of the island would cause flooding in any 
towns surrounding Lake Brey.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern</b>: Barbarian hordes are a thing of the

<p align="LEFT">The Sword Coast North is a harsh land of cold and 
mountains and almost constant conflict. Monsters from the Spine of the 
World threaten anyone who settles too close to the mountain range, and 
orc hordes sweep from the mountains to decimate the towns. In these 
lands, people either live in the large cities (which essentially 
function like islands), or in small groups on their own pursuing a 
living from the land. Rarely do these two "worlds" meet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In Silverymoon lives a wizard called Nostar. He is 
developing a special cold-based spell to use against ice devils, and he 
needs some frost giant components (including a large patch of unmarked 
skin). In return for some adventurers going and getting what he needs, 
he is willing to offer one or more treasure maps that have come into his
 collection. He would want 10% of whatever is recovered, but he has maps
 to treasures in ancient Gauntlgtrym (see <i>Lost Empires of Faerûn</i>, page 143), Old Illusk (<i>Lost Empires of Faerûn</i>
 page 144), and a lost Netherese city in the edges of the Anauroch. 
Nostar can also tell them about the general area and where frost giants 
are most likely to be found.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once on the way, the adventurers run into a small town 
that has been decimated by something quite large. Every person in town 
has been killed, all buildings destroyed, and blood covers everything. 
The people here were killed horribly, and tracks lead back toward the 
Lands Against the Wall.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Kostchtchie, demon lord of frost giants, has sent an 
aspect to a newly converted tribe of frost giants to lead them in bloody
 conquest of the lands around them. The aspect leads his giants against 
human settlements as well as other giant settlements -- even other frost
 giant settlements.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>

and have dealt with the raging tribe, they will attract the attention of
 other frost giants.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 41-75 There are a lot of other monsters to worry about 
in the Spine of the World. The trip should be a constant battle, or 
series of battles, against a lot of frosty opponents.</p>
