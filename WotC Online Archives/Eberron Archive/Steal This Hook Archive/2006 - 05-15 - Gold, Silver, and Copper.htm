 away. An air of condescension and tolerance crosses the creature's 
expression as it looks down upon your small form. Fear and reverence and
 avarice flare across its features all at the same time. This month is 
all about dragons, and metallic ones at that. Even though they're always
 good (everywhere except Eberron, of course), they can still play really
 interesting roles in adventures other than "ally of the heroes" or 
"source of information for the heroes" or even "one who looks down on

<p align="LEFT">The town of New Cyre in eastern Breland is the new home 
of the refugees of the ruined nation of Cyre. The town began as a 
refugee camp and is now quite large. To this place comes a group of five
 half-orc merchants, laden with wares to sell. This is not at all 
unusual, and, except for the wares, the half-orcs don't attract any 
suspicious notice -- at least not at first.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The leader of the group, Halk-Astan (half-orc 
bard/scout), works the group's stall in the market. He tells a fantastic
 story that introduces buyers to his wares: parts from a gold dragon. 
"That's right," he says. "A gold dragon. We don't even see gold dragons 
on Khorvaire normally, but my troop and I were incredibly lucky. We were
 in the Seawall Mountains, prospecting for whatever minerals we could 
find, and also looking to slay some goblinoids. On our third day, we saw
 a huge shape fly overhead, and we were so surprised to see a golden 
dragon flying above us. Now, I don't know what it was doing there, but 
about an hour later we saw a silver dragon just as big flying off in the
 same direction. Then we heard the fighting. The two dragons were going 
at each other with all they had, let me tell you. Finally, the silver 
one slew the gold one and it plummeted to the ground -- well over 200 
feet I'd say. We couldn't pass up this good fortune, since we figured 
that parts from a gold dragon are worth a lot to spellcasters. So we 
harvested what we could, and now we offer them to you at very reasonable
 prices."</p>

in the Earthfast Mountains and the Vast, in the Graypeak Mountains and 
Loudwater, or Orsraun Mountains and Turmish.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Set it in the Seawall Mountains, as written.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> The main requirement for this adventure 
is that you have some mountains where a dragon might live. Creating a 
wondrous cave complex that would attract dragons is not necessary; you 
could just have some dragon lairs in the vicinity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> No real dragons are involved, and the
 parts come from some other known monster whose parts are valuable. Set 
in Siberia or Alaska.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The problem, of course, is that the parts are not from a
 gold dragon at all. They are from wyverns that the half-orcs slew in 
the mountains. Suspicion begins to mount a day or two after the 
half-orcs leave town, since the parts don't work in magic potions and 
spells as their users had hoped. Several wizards who feel cheated of the
 large sums they paid want the adventurers to track down the orcs, find 
out what really happened, and get their money back. Of course, if any 
real gold dragons are involved, the wizards would take real parts 
instead of their money.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-40 The wizards are sincere in their desires, especially the part about replacement gold dragon parts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-75 The half-orcs told the truth (sort of); they 
really are gold dragon parts. The wizards think these erstwhile 
merchants have more and want the adventurers to trace the half-orcs down
 so the wizards can swoop in and steal the rest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Halk-Astan is really a gold dragon in disguise, 
and he wants the heroes to go clean out the Seven Caves of wyverns so he
 can study the Prophecy. He hopes that using the wyvern parts will lead 
suspicious folk to the wyvern-infested caves, and he makes sure to plant
 some rumors that the half-orcs were heading that way.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-45 Wyverns live and breed in the Seven Caves, and the adventurers could have a lot of difficulty with them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-70 The Seven Caves is supposed to contain a part of 
the draconic Prophecy. Dragonmarks swirl across their surfaces, and few 
have ever tried to study them. A gold dragon is there now, in the fifth 
cave, trying to piece together a part of the Prophecy that came to him 
in a dream. He is not evil, but he is not good, either, and will object 
to having parts taken.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-00 Goblinoids from Darguun are in the same area, and 
they don't take kindly to the adventurers learning about their 
activities in the area.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2005-15%20-%20Gold,%20Silver,%20and%20Copper_files/dx0515sh_stealhook_copper.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="218" width="289">Put That Back! -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Dragons can be found anywhere in Faerûn, or so it seems.
 The people of the land are used to them living in far-away mountains 
and only occasionally appearing (at least in dragon form) in civilized 
lands. So the residents of a small town just south of the Serpent Hills 
are surprised when a copper dragon lands in the middle town and demands 
that the townspeople rebuild its hoard. It claims that human adventurers
 stole its hoard while it was away, and that the humans owe restitution.
 It grabs a random townsperson and flies off, promising to come back and
 take his recompense out of the lives of the townspeople if they don't 
comply.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The people of the town don't feel that they should pay 
this steep price for something they didn't even do, so they look for 
some heroes to solve their problem by tracking down this dragon and 
dealing with it. Some wonder why a good dragon would behave this way, 
but in light of imminent destruction, they are not that concerned about 
the oddness of it.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you need some suggestions for different campaign worlds, you'll find them below. Additionally, <i>Draconomicon</i> should help you with the dragons. If the evil wizard is present, you'll want <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179250000">Complete Arcane</a></i> and maybe <i>Spell Compendium</i> to really make him a challenge for your player characters. Yuan-ti are covered in several books, including <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/885987200">Savage Species</a></i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Set it in the Serpent Hills, as written.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> The presence of a copper dragon would be
 very unusual on Khorvaire, so set this adventure on Aerenal where the 
elves are in a constant war (of sorts) with the dragons of Argonnessen.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> Mountains and a town nearby are all you 
need. It would help if dragons really did live in the mountains, but the
 adventure takes on a new level of mystery if it is not widely known 
that dragons live in the mountains.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> This adventure would probably work best on another planet (<i>d20 Future</i>),
 where dragons could be more populous. Alternatively, you could make 
this whole thing a yuan-ti experiment or deception and place it in some 
remote location in South America, using dinosaurs or giant snakes or 
something like that.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Killing a dragon that has no treasure is not a very 
rewarding task, so the townspeople point out that a lot of other dragons
 lair in the Serpent Hills, and if player characters could kill one of 
the evil ones they would be quite wealthy. The townspeople might even 
offer a map of reputed dragon dens, which local rangers keep just in 
case the knowledge could be useful someday (though knowing where NOT to 
go can certainly come in handy, too). These hoards could contain 
Netherese magic, among other things, because some of the dragons in the 
Serpent Hills are very old.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-40 The town is really in trouble, but not from the 
copper dragon that landed there. The copper dragon is actually a red 
dragon that is using this stratagem to add to its own hoard, and it 
hopes that the townspeople won't try to kill a good creature but will 
try to negotiate.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-80 The copper dragon has been rendered insane by one 
of the magic items in its hoard. It is really good, but must be cured of
 its insanity and the item removed from the hoard for everything to end 
happily.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 One of the townspeople offers the heroes a pretty 
penny for any copper dragon parts they can acquire, since those are 
difficult to come by. Further, he offers to help them make armor from 
any scales they bring back.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 Red dragons in the Serpent Hills are entertained 
by the story of the renegade copper, but they are not entertained by the
 presence of heroes who like to steal dragons' hoards.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-70 The copper dragon is an illusion created by a wizard that plans to steal the tribute once it is collected.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-00 The adventurers run afoul of yuan-ti while on 
their quest. The yuan-ti offer to help the adventurers (any dead dragons
 are a benefit to them), but later double-cross the heroes.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2005-15%20-%20Gold,%20Silver,%20and%20Copper_files/dx0515sh_stealhook_silver.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="270" width="292">Heart of Silver -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Before the modern races stepped onto the Faerûnian 
stage, the great wyrms ruled the land and acted with impunity, since 
they were unchallenged by any other creator race. Eventually, the lesser
 races mastered magic and became threats to the dragons. And thus the 
world began to change. In the last years of this time, the greatest 
human wizards tried to gain control of the oldest and most powerful 
silver dragon in existence, Kinenthurnurnverasal. The dragon proved too 
powerful for them, but they put it into stasis nonetheless. They cut out
 its heart and made of the heart a powerful amulet that contained the 
dragon's life force. Then they broke the heart into three pieces. 
Eventually the pieces went to different owners. In the present day, two 
are held by two rogues in Waterdeep (read the Rogues and Ruffians 
section in <i>City of Splendors: Waterdeep</i> for a few ideas on specific beings you may want to choose), and the third is lost to history.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you want to use this in different campaign worlds, take a look at the suggestions that follow. Also, <i>City of Splendors: Waterdeep</i>
 should be invaluable for the first part of the adventure, including 
selecting or creating the rogues involved. The Orsraun Mountains are 
full of monsters, so just about any book (including the upcoming <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953767200">Monster Manual IV</a></i>)
 will have you cackling with glee as you select encounters with which to
 plague your adventurers and make their approach to the ancient body as 
difficult as it should be.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Use it as written.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> In Eberron, the dragons ruled the 
ancient world, too, and now have retreated to Argonnessen. The heroes 
could find the lost piece on Khorvaire, then collect the two other 
pieces from rival thieves' guildmasters in Sharn, before undertaking the
 really dangerous journey into Argonnessen to fulfill this ancient 
story.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> A large city with rival guildmasters serves as the starting point, and you can put the ancient dragon's body anywhere.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> This adventure requires significant 
modification to work well on Modern Earth. Perhaps the dragon was a 
powerful antediluvian creature, and the wizards who put it into stasis 
were aliens of some kind.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The body of Kinenthurnurnverasal remains in stasis in a 
cave deep beneath the Orsraun Mountains, where no one has found it in 
generations. Legends from that ancient time say that if the heart of 
Kinenthurnurnverasal can be remade and restored to his preserved body, 
the dragon will be reborn and that the one who does this can command 
service from the ancient and powerful dragon as one would do with a 
genie.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Should this tale reach the ears of the rogues, their 
initial tendency is to never cooperate with any plan to restore the 
dragon to life because each would be afraid that the other would gain 
the benefit.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The adventure begins for the heroes when they find the 
lost piece in a hoard of treasure held by the Zhentarim, who know the 
item is magic but have no idea what it does. The heroes find out 
(perhaps via a sage or other luminary that the PCs visit regularly), and
 they then have to collect the two pieces from the rival rogues. Their 
sponsor, should they need one, is the sage who informs them what the 
heart piece really is.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since the heroes start this adventure of their own volition, the usual Motivations section doesn't apply.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-25 One or both of the rival rogues offers to help in 
the quest, but provides a false heart piece and then follows the heroes 
to the body to claim the rewards for himself or herself.</p>
<p align="LEFT">26-45 The legend is only partly true. The ancient dragon
 has become evil because of what happened to it, and the heroes have to 
stop it from unleashing its ancient might on the world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-70 The whole legend is false. There is an artifact 
that is in three pieces, but it is not the heart of an ancient dragon. 
The sage who tells them this knows what it really is and plans to 
acquire it from the heroes once they have the whole artifact.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-90 A modern-day dragon believes that should it place 
the heart within itself, that it will acquire the power of the ancient 
dragon through its trapped life force and become invincible. This dragon
 plagues the heroes every step of their quest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The heart pieces have a curse on them that 
inflicts anyone who steals them from their current owner with a wasting 
disease that requires an epic spellcaster to cure.</p>
