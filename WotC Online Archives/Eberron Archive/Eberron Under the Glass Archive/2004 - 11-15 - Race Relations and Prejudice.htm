<p align="left">Welcome to "Eberron Under the Glass," a column that takes a look at how to handle staple themes of <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. Whether the characters must search for a lost artifact, unearth lore in an old tome, or deal with a goblin uprising, <b>Eberron</b> campaigns do things a little differently. This series helps <b>Eberron</b> players and DMs get the right feel in the setting.</p>
<p align="left">Take a look at prejudice and other race-related issues in Eberron.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Not So Cut-And-Dry</b></p>
<p align="left">In a standard campaign, racial interaction among the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 races is pretty simple. Humans get along with everyone, dwarves think 
elves are flighty, nobody trusts half-orcs, and so on. Despite these 
feelings, the typical <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign has a fairly cosmopolitan 
feel, with all races living in peace in larger cities with no serious 
racial conflicts. In the <b>Eberron</b> setting, things are much more 
complicated, mainly in that there are different groups of each race, and
 people may have bad feelings toward one and not the other; racism's 
roots in Eberron, as in the real world, tend to be based on culture 
rather than actual race. (As the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i> says on page 24, "A character from an <b>Eberron</b> campaign is never just a human or a dwarf: He is a human from Thrane or a dwarf from the Mror Holds.")</p>
<p align="left">For example, the elves of House Phiarlan are an old 
dragonmarked house with a centuries-long history of entertainment and 
artistry; most common folk praise them and their work. In contrast to 
that house, the elves of the new nation of Valenar are seen as land 
thieves and a threat to the peace established by the Treaty of 
Thronehold. Will the acts of the Valenar elves paint those of House 
Phiarlan with the same stigma? Will the people of Khorvaire grow to 
dislike elves as a whole but tolerate House Phiarlan because "they're 
the good ones"?</p>
<p align="left">Humans, as rulers of much of Khorvaire for nearly a 
thousand years, have a reputation for nation building. Sharn is arguably
 the greatest city on the continent, and its residents see themselves as
 the most civilized people on the continent. By contrast, the humans of 
the Shadow Marches are illiterate unwashed swamp-dwellers who consort 
with orcs. Even though a human from Sharn may look exactly like a human 
from the Shadow Marches, the Brelander is comfortable looking down on 
the Marcher as something less human. Likewise, the refugees from Cyre, 
regardless of race, are looked down upon as the biggest losers in the 
war that hurt everyone, and some folk think disaster struck the Cyrans 
because they somehow deserved it, and so they heap additional abuse on 
them for their assumed crimes. Culture, not physical race, is seen as 
justifiable cause for prejudice.</p>
<p align="left">Half-orcs, often the scapegoat for anything unpleasant, 
most commonly hail from Droaam, the Eldeen Reaches, or the Shadow 
Marches, and some form part of House Tharashk. People see Droaam 
half-orcs as dangerous monsters and Shadow Marches half-orcs as 
primitives; citizens of Aundair see Reaches half-orcs (and anyone else 
from there) as separatists and nation-betrayers while those outside 
Aundair don't think about them at all. In contrast to all of this, most 
consider House Thrarashk's half-orcs and humans to be very talented 
scouts with a critical skill for finding valuable resources. Again, 
culture and nationality is more important than actual race.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Old Races and New Races</b></p>
<p align="left">Many typical <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns use the standard races and may include one unusual race, such as lizard-folk, aasimar, and so on. By contrast, the <b>Eberron</b>
 campaign has four new races in common play (changeling, kalashtar, 
shifter, and warforged). Each of these "new" races is something unusual 
and their role in the campaign can make many "normal" people nervous, 
and that can lead to racism in the strictest sense. Any member of these 
races is likely to run into intolerance on a regular basis, whether in 
urban or rural environments, from any of the older races.</p>
<p align="left">Changelings are descended from humans and doppelgangers,
 and their natural ability to hide their true appearance means that few 
people ever fully trust them -- how can you confide in someone who might
 take on your face and use your secrets against you? Anyone who sees one
 in its natural form understands that it isn't really human and 
therefore its motives are suspect. The changeling tendency to consort 
with criminals only reinforces this prejudice, and in turn it means that
 the only place a changeling can find some acceptance is in the very 
criminal organizations that turn law-abiding people against them.</p>
<p align="left">Kalashtar may appear physically attractive in a human 
sense, but their alien mind sets them apart, and while your typical 
adventurer is more accepting of strangeness, an average farmer or 
city-dweller doesn't take well to a "pretty-looking, funny-talking" 
kalashtar any more than someone in the modern world takes to a slick 
politician or book-minded ecologist telling them what's right and wrong.
 The kalashtar's tendency toward sincere goodness ameliorates some of 
their suspicion, but many people are always reminded of their ties to 
the Region of Dreams and the horrible quori that rule that place -- a 
fact that makes ignorant people fear them.</p>
<p align="left">In some ways, shifters have the worst situation of all 
the new races. They can't pass as fully human like the changelings, they
 aren't beautiful and inherently good like the kalashtar, and they 
weren't built to be loyal soldiers like the warforged. Shifters are 
descended from lycanthropes, which many people consider to be monsters 
(and the shifters only a step above that). Crude, feral, and obviously 
not human, the shifters are feared by many common folk, and most 
shifters find themselves shunned for their appearance and mannerisms, 
particularly in places where the Church of the Silver Flame's crusade 
against lycanthropes was taken to heart.</p>
<p align="left">To most people, warforged are an unfortunate reminder of
 the Last War. Built for combat and not for peace, the warforged race's 
clumsy attempts to blend in with normal society do not endear anyone to 
them. It doesn't help that the most famous member of their race, the 
Lord of Blades, has declared that the warforged shall rule Eberron, 
which renders all warforged as possible collaborators in this construct 
plot. Unlike veterans of other races, warforged can't blend in; the Last
 War resides in every fiber of their being. In some lands people treat 
them as property, and in most other places many still see them more as 
living weapons than as true people. Your average person is glad that no 
more warforged are being built (since the secret forging isn't publicly 
known) so that eventually this "race" will die out.</p>
<p align="left">One thing to remember, though, is that the people of 
Eberron have a strong national identity because of decades of war, and 
that colors their racial perceptions; a Brelander may think that 
shifters are savage and changelings are untrustworthy, but a shifter or 
changeling from Breland is still better than anyone from Valenar or old 
Cyre. In many cases, nationalist bigotry is more common and accepted 
than racial bigotry.</p>
