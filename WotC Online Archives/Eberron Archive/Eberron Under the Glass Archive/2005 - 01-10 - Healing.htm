<p align="left">Welcome to "Eberron Under the Glass," a column that takes a look at how to handle staple themes of <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. Whether the characters must search for a lost artifact, unearth lore in an old tome, or deal with a goblin uprising, <b>Eberron</b> campaigns do things a little differently. This series helps <b>Eberron</b> players and DMs get the right feel in the setting.</p>
<p align="left">This article looks at the concept of healing in Eberron.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Few Spellcasters, Many Experts</b></p>
<p align="left">In a typical <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign, magical healing is
 readily available, even if it requires heading back to a town or city 
to get a spell the party cleric or druid is too inexperienced to cast. 
In Eberron, minor magic is more common while mid- to high-level magic is
 relatively rare because few characters have PC classes, and NPC classes
 are slower to achieve anything but the weakest spells. This means that 
anything other than the most basic healing is out of the reach of most 
NPCs, and PCs can have difficulties finding available spellcasters to 
help them out with healing magic (whether it's just a simple <i>remove disease</i>, or something more serious like <i>raise dead</i> or <i>heal</i>).</p>
<p align="left">Even given the slight increase in the number of adepts compared to a typical <b>D&amp;D</b>
 campaign (1% instead of 0.5%), an adept's slower spell progression 
means that few of them ever achieve 2nd-level spellcasting. Furthermore,
 most of the spells an adventurer needs from an NPC spellcaster aren't 
on the adept list (<i>lesser restoration</i> is noticeably absent, for 
example) or require a very high-level adept because of the slow 
spellcasting progression in that class. This means that except for 
simple healing like <i>cure light wounds</i>, PCs can't depend on NPC 
spellcasting to help them recover from adventuring afflictions. (It also
 means that people in Eberron may consider low-level arcane magic 
somewhat routine, while divine healing is still somewhat surprising.)</p>
<p align="left">Fortunately, magic isn't the only solution. The Heal 
skill can treat immediate injury, give long-term care, deal with poison,
 and thwart disease. Though these take far longer than what the typical 
adventurer demands, they're more than sufficient to take care of the 
normal people of the world. After all, the regular folk of Eberron don't
 deal with situations where they need to recover 50 hit points in a 
hurry (most people have less than 20 hit points), and while the fantasy 
equivalents of dysentery and cholera are certainly dangerous, they're 
relatively safe and slow-acting compared to DC 16 mummy rot. Since the 
common people rarely can afford magical healing methods (a <i>remove disease</i>
 spell costs 150 gp, which is the equivalent of about five years' wages 
for an unskilled laborer), nonmagical methods are their only hope.</p>
<p align="left">Because of these factors, most temple healers are 
experts rather than spellcasters, and even a 1st-level expert dedicated 
to healing -- 4 ranks in Heal, +2 from Self-Sufficient or +3 from Skill 
Focus (Heal) for a total bonus of +6 or +7 without counting ability 
score bonuses -- can be the difference between life or death for someone
 injured, poisoned, or diseased, so normal people don't dismiss the help
 of nonmagical healing just because it's not magic. Of course, a 
1st-level PC cleric probably has a Heal skill modifier as good or better
 than that, so yet again NPC healers aren't much help to a typical 
adventurer.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Serve the Faithful First</b></p>
<p align="left">As mentioned above, skilled spellcasters in Eberron are 
uncommon, and a temple with a spellcaster capable of performing serious 
healing magic isn't likely to hire that person out to anyone with enough
 gold. While in a typical <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign you can trust the 
church of Pelor or Ilmater to provide healing (for a fee or donation) to
 anyone in need, in Eberron even benign churches such as the Silver 
Flame or the Sovereign Host aren't willing to expend their precious 
divine spells on nonbelievers (as Keith Baker mentioned in his 
Dragonshards article on <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20040705a">religion in Eberron</a>).
 Not even dirty unwashed adventurers are exempt from this; if a person 
can't prove that she is a believer, she is not going to get any valuable
 magic cast on her behalf.</p>
<p align="left">Temples fortunate enough to have spellcasting priests 
(whether advanced adepts or crusading clerics), normally expect payment 
from adventurers in services rather than money (while any merchant or 
noble can cough up gold or simple favors, adventurers are exceptional 
people capable of exceptional deeds, and the churches want to take 
advantage of these extraordinary talents). This gives an <b>Eberron</b> 
DM an easy hook for adventures, particularly if one or more of the PCs 
has strong ties to a particular religion -- whether that adventurer is a
 cleric, druid, paladin (or even a devout member of another class).</p>
<p align="left">As Keith Baker pointed out in his article, corrupt 
clerics are the exception to the "no paying for spellcasting" rule; such
 individuals are far more likely to use their god-given powers to 
acquire riches as long as they believe in the long run it benefits the 
church in some way. Such behavior may warrant expelling the corrupt 
cleric from the temple, and these characters make interesting cohorts or
 hirelings for PCs -- a ready source of healing magic, though sure to 
cause controversy when the PCs need to meet with uncorrupted members of 
that faith. Corrupt clerics-in-exile might even set up camps near known 
adventuring sites (such as on a road to the Mournland, a safe distance 
outside the mist) where they can charge high prices for their 
desperately needed services.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, PCs can turn the general lack of spellcasting
 to their advantage by trading their rare gifts for other benefits. For 
example, after saving a town from hobgoblin raiders, the PC cleric 
leader can talk the locals into renovating the local temple of her 
faith, then promise to return once a year to use magic to heal the 
townsfolk. This benefits the local expert-priest (who has a better 
living space and a stronger focus point for religious services in town),
 the church (which gets an improved temple and local goodwill), and the 
PC (who gains fame for her generosity and pledge of support). Over time 
the town might grow from this attention, and when the PC decides to 
retire she may find a temple or even a secular position waiting for her 
there.</p>
<p align="left"><b>House Jorasco</b></p>
<p align="left">One bit of chaos in the above assumptions is House 
Jorasco. Unlike temples, they do provide healing services (mundane and 
magical) for anyone and they do it for money. Since even a 1st-level 
character can possess a least dragonmark, House Jorasco has a large 
number of magical healers at their disposal despite having no access to 
the gods. Jorasco's talented healers and mercantile mindset make them 
the points of contact for anyone needing healing, particularly those who
 cannot or will not associate with the local temples. It is important to
 note that while the "typical" healer of House Jorasco described in the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i> is a 3rd-level adept, Keith Baker offers an alternate healer (the Jorasco Apothecary) in his Dragonshards article <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20040823a">about magewrights</a>; the apothecary also makes potions, and in Eberron the members of House Jorasco are the best source of healing potions.</p>
<p align="left">As noted in the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>, the 
code of the House requires they heal any who need it as long as they can
 pay, which means they sometimes deal with unsavory characters. This 
means that the House may need the help of adventurers from time to time 
to sort out hostilities between groups they help (such as two prominent 
noble houses intent on making sure only their family survives an ongoing
 violent feud) or to fend off unwanted political pressure when it is 
undiplomatic to call upon the guild headquarters for intervention.</p>
