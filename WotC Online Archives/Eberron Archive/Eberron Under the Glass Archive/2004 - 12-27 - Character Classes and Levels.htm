<p align="left">Welcome to "Eberron Under the Glass," a column that takes a look at how to handle staple themes of <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. Whether the characters must search for a lost artifact, unearth lore in an old tome, or deal with a goblin uprising, <b>Eberron</b> campaigns do things a little differently. This series helps <b>Eberron</b> players and DMs get the right feel in the setting.</p>
<p align="left">This article looks at the concept of character classes and levels in Eberron.</p>
<p align="left"><b>PC Classes Are Rare</b></p>
<p align="left">In a standard campaign, characters with PC classes are 
uncommon but frequent enough to not be extraordinary. For example, on 
page 139 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, a typical 200-person 
hamlet has 13 characters with PC classes, including 3 clerics and 3 
fighters. While that number seems small (it's less than 10% of the 
hamlet's population), it means that a party of four PCs in a hamlet are 
outnumbered by the number of PC-class NPCs.</p>
<p align="left">By comparison, most of the people of Eberron never have 
the potential to take levels in PC classes. Adepts and experts run the 
temples, while the rare cleric is a true knight of the church. A typical
 veteran of the Last War is a 2nd-level warrior, while fighters are 
specialists and officers. Common cutpurses are merely experts, and 
guildmasters and master thieves are rogues. Spellcasters who create 
common magic items are magewrights, and only the true wizards wield the 
mightiest spells and forge the items of legend.</p>
<p align="left">People with character classes are larger than life, even
 early in their career. PC-class characters are the Amelia Earharts, 
Wyatt Earps, and Thomas Edisons of their day -- famous and capable of 
things no normal man or woman could accomplish. Ask anyone who knew one 
of these people in their younger years and they'll tell you they were 
destined for something great. Of course, most people believed they were 
crazy, too, so being a person who is "special" in this way is a mixed 
blessing. Nonetheless, PC-class characters are the rare exception to the
 unwashed masses. In Eberron, a true cleric or wizard is someone to 
respect or even fear, and a paladin isn't someone you take for granted.</p>
<p align="left">The same standards apply to evil characters; even at an 
early age, they stand out. Townsfolk remember the young man who tortured
 and dissected animals, and when it turns out years later that he joined
 the Cults of the Dragon Below, they nod as if they expected it. Fellow 
students of the woman now known as Demise (see the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting,</i>
 page 252) remember her as strange and obsessed, and they always 
suspected she was up to no good. In modern terms, the average person who
 does evil is the one with neighbors who say, "He was a quiet fellow -- 
never caused any trouble," whereas neighbors remember the exceptional 
person as, "He always seemed strange, gave me the creeps, didn't like 
having him around."</p>
<p align="left">During play, players should see that normal people 
recognize them as unusual, just as they should sense when an NPC is 
similarly unusual. This is not to say that every memorable villain NPC 
has to have a PC class or that characters with NPC classes can't make 
interesting villains. It means that a sense of parity exists between 
heroic PCs and villainous PCs. When Indiana Jones vied with Belloq in <i>Raiders of a Lost Ark</i>,
 it was a contest of equals. Heroic PCs should face off against their 
equals from time to time, too -- even in Eberron where PC-class 
characters are rare.</p>
<p align="left"><b>High-Level Characters Are Rare</b></p>
<p align="left">The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> assumes that in a 
typical campaign, a significant number of NPCs of all non-epic levels 
exist in the world. Your typical small city has at least one 7th-level 
NPC of each of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> classes, or at least 
10th-level in a large city and at least 13th-level in a metropolis (with
 additional characters at half that level, more at one-fourth that 
level, and so on).</p>
<p align="left">In Eberron, the numbers are much lower. Just as their PC
 classes set PCs apart from normal people, their heroic adventures lead 
to increased class levels unavailable to common folk. As author Keith 
Baker points out in one of his <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20040712a">Dragonshard articles</a>,
 it's perfectly acceptable for a 20-year veteran soldier to still be 2nd
 level because most NPCs do not gain experience in the way that PCs do. 
That same article has variant tables that show how Eberron settlements 
have fewer high-level characters than a standard campaign. This means 
that in a few short months of adventuring, a young PC can outstrip the 
abilities of everyone in his home town and even those of experienced NPC
 characters in large cities. In Eberron, a "high level" character may be
 less than 10th level (for example, the Lord of Blades is 12th level, 
and he's feared for his own power in addition to the army of warforged 
he leads).</p>
<p align="left">What does this mean in terms of gameplay? It means that 
established adventurers are forces to be reckoned with. A typical large 
city might have only five fighters at 4th level or higher, so the 
arrival of a party of four 6th-level heroes will draw some attention. 
Commoners and younger warriors wonder aloud if the visitors could beat 
the local champions in a fight. Magewrights gossip about a visiting 
wizard and whether or not she plans to dump any of her unwanted magic 
items on "their" market. Corrupt adepts and greedy expert-priests worry 
that the new cleric of the faith in town will upset business in their 
temple. Pickpockets and thugs wonder if the famous trapfinder is looking
 to take over the local thieves' guild. Though 6th-level characters are 
B-list celebrities, they're still celebrities. Any 10th-level characters
 are the stars, and NPCs will treat them as such.</p>
<p align="left">One way to think of this celebrity is in terms of 
television shows or weekly movie serials. For the first few episodes of a
 show or serial, the viewers don't have any strong attachment to the 
characters because they haven't learned much about them. After the sixth
 or seventh episode, the viewers have learned to like or dislike the 
characters and know what sort of behavior to expect. After a full 
season, the viewers either love or hate the characters. Each significant
 adventure by the PCs is like an episode. At first they're unknown and 
untested. After several adventures, word gets out and the PCs are known 
well enough to have a following -- even to the point of making some 
casual enemies. After a year of adventuring, the PCs have a well-known 
reputation among regular people and several mortal enemies who'd like to
 see them dead. People in need approach heroic PCs for help and avoid 
those known to cause trouble, while villains avoid the heroes and try to
 recruit the troublemakers. PCs don't need to hang out in taverns to 
find work; people approach them on the street and local officials track 
them down at home.</p>
<p align="left">Their abilities and power level make PCs a cut above 
most people in the world. With Eberron's advanced travel and 
communication methods, information travels quickly and a PC's notoriety 
spreads beyond the immediate area of their deeds. In Eberron, PCs are 
heroes, and they have a hard time trying to keep a low profile. 
Fortunately, when the PCs are famous, it just makes it easier for the DM
 to introduce excitement, danger, and cliffhanger action!</p>
