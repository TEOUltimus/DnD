<p align="left">The first part of this article examined groups and religions that be could used as sources for the sinister aspects of <i>Libris Mortis</i>. This section looks at the groups that fight the undead along with a few additional aspects of the book. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Fighting the Darkness</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Libris Mortis</i> presents a host of tools and 
techniques for fighting the undead: feats, spells, prestige classes, and
 more weapons against the restless dead. Like the rest of the material 
in the book, these elements could be made available to all characters at
 once. However, it can be more interesting to limit these techniques to 
specific religions or groups as described in the first part of this 
article. </p>
<p align="left">The following organizations are at the forefront of the war against the undead. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Deathguard</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-20%20-%20Libris%20Mortis,%20Part%20Two_files/eb0220ee_eberronexp_hod.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="397" width="186">The
 Undying Court teaches that negative undead are conduits to Mabar and 
that merely by existing, these creatures slowly drain away the 
life-force of Eberron itself. For the most part, the Aereni prefer to 
avoid contact with the outside world, but the war against undead is a 
danger that bypasses all borders. The soldiers engaged in this conflict 
are known as the Deathguard, an elite unit dedicated to the Undying 
Court and to eradicating the taint of undeath from the world. </p>
<p align="left">The Deathguard is largely comprised of clerics, 
paladins, and fighters who have access to the Sacred Purifier prestige 
class, the Hunter of the Dead PrC from <i>Complete Warrior</i>, and the Sacred Exorcist PrC from <i>Complete Divine</i>. The order also includes a small corps of cleric/rogues with levels in the Shadowbane Stalker PrC from <i>Complete Adventurer</i> -- these agents are often equipped with <i>ghost strike</i>
 weapons, allowing them to make sneak attacks against incorporeal 
undead. In a world where most NPCs possess NPC class levels, the 
Deathguard are among the best at what they do, chosen from the most 
gifted soldiers and priests of Aerenal. But they are few in number, and 
the loss of any Deathguard is a blow to the Undying Court. </p>
<p align="left">Clerics of the Deathguard can use the spells from <i>Libris Mortis </i>designed to fight undead (<i>ghost trap, ghost touch armor, protection from negative energy, spawn screen</i>, <i>undead bane weapon, </i>and
 similar effects) and should have access to many of the new feats. 
Aerenal is known for its manifest zones linked to Irian, and rituals 
performed in these regions infuse the Deathguard with positive energy. 
This in turn allows them to take feats such as Enduring Life, Empower 
Turning, Sacred Vitality, and Unquenchable Flame of Life. Participation 
in such a ritual could easily be a prerequisite for PCs who wish to take
 these feats. If a character can earn the respect of the Deathguard, she
 may be initiated into these mysteries. </p>
<p align="left">The servants of the Deathguard are proud folk who 
believe that their calling places them above mortal laws. Others, 
however, do not share this view. The elves are generally required to act
 covertly. While they may strike at any undead creature or any 
necromancer that creates negative undead, they seek to battle the most 
significant targets -- powerful vampire lords, leaders of the Blood of 
Vol, and the like. Meanwhile, Erandis d'Vol despises the Deathguard and 
always takes any opportunity to eliminate a Deathguard unit. Because of 
this, Deathguard warriors may be unexpected allies in any battle against
 the Blood of Vol ... or they could show up unexpectedly as adventurers 
engaged in a delicate undercover operation! </p>
<p align="left">Finally, the elves of Aerenal are the obvious source for
 positoxins. The jungles of Aerenal contain a host of unusual plants, 
many of which have been altered by exposure to the energies of Irian and
 Mabar. Between their long studies of the energies of these planes and 
their hatred of negative undead, the Aereni are the logical force to 
have developed these unusual tools. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Silver Flame</b></p>
<p align="left">The templars of the Silver Flame fight supernatural evil
 in all forms, and most creatures that prey on the blood and lifeforce 
of mortals qualify. There is one area in which the clerics of the Silver
 Flame stand supreme -- exorcism. Any Silver Flame priest with the 
Exorcism domain should gain the following benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the <i>ghost trap </i>spell (assuming he is of sufficient level to cast it).<br><br></li>
<li>+4 to Knowledge (religion) checks made to force a haunting presence to manifest. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As a rule, the soldiers of the Silver Flame do not have 
the focus or knowledge of undead possessed by the Deathguard and rarely 
possess the specialized feats, spells, and PrCs of <i>Libris Mortis</i>.
 In the long struggle with the undead armies of Karrnath, however, the 
clerics of Thrane learned to hone their skills at turning lesser undead.
 Honored clerics are brought before the Fountain of Flame at the heart 
of Flamekeep, where they are blessed in a ritual performed by the Keeper
 of the Flame herself. Those who receive this blessing can choose to 
take the Empower Turning, Heighten Turning, and Quicken Turning feats 
(when they are able to acquire new feats). </p>
<p align="left">In general, followers of the Silver Flame consider 
obvious undead creatures to be dangerous and unnatural, and they will 
have a hostile reaction toward those who traffic with the undead. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sovereign Host</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-20%20-%20Libris%20Mortis,%20Part%20Two_files/eb0220ee_eberronexp_rsop.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="221" width="170">Within
 the Sovereign Host, persecution of the undead is the dominion of Dol 
Arrah, the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice. When the Shadow and the 
Keeper unleash their horrors against the living, it is the light of Dol 
Arrah that drives them back. Because the Sovereign Host is a pantheistic
 religion, most clerics of the Host are invoking Dol Arrah when they 
turn undead; those with the Sun domain have studied her rituals more 
closely and are thus able to perform greater turnings. </p>
<p align="left">Generalist priests of the Sovereign Host are not 
expected to battle undead on a regular basis, so they have no access to 
the specialized abilities of <i>Libris Mortis</i>. There are, however, a
 number of orders dedicated to Dol Arrah that draw on these specialized 
tools. The Blades of the Sun is a line of paladins -- when properly 
sanctified, its members may take the Divine Accuracy or Sacred Vengeance
 feats and gain access to the <i>undead bane weapon </i>spell. A number 
of Dol Arrah's priests have formed ties with the Deathguard and learned 
their techniques; these priests often offer shelter and support to elves
 operating far from Aerenal. </p>
<p align="left">Followers of Dol Arrah may take the Radiant Servant of Pelor prestige class presented in <i>Complete Divine</i>.
 A few have learned the path of the Sacred Purifier from the Deathguard,
 but this has yet to come into common use. A player character who wishes
 to take Purifier levels will most likely need to turn to Aerenal. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Red Watchers</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Magic of Eberron </i>introduces a new organization 
dedicated to fighting the undead -- the Red Watchers, who seek to 
cleanse the land of Karrnath. The Red Watchers have developed their own 
unique prestige class, the Deadgrim. Characters who follow this path 
walk a line between life and death. The Tomb-Tainted Soul feats are an 
excellent way to further develop this ambiguity. The Ghost Scarred feat 
is also highly appropriate for Red Watchers. Beyond this, the Red 
Watchers are not a religion in their own right. Most members of the 
organization come from a background with the Silver Flame or the 
Sovereign Host, as outlined above. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Deathless and <i>Libris Mortis</i></b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-20%20-%20Libris%20Mortis,%20Part%20Two_files/eb0220ee_eberronexp_undying.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="304" width="174">The <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>
 includes a new creature type that has considerable overlap with the 
undead: the deathless, the best known of which are the Undying of 
Aerenal. The deathless are being sustained after death by positive 
energy and the devotion of the descendants.<b></b>How do the deathless interact with <i>Libris Mortis</i>? </p>
<p align="left">One simple answer is to allow the deathless to take 
appropriate feats as if they were of the undead type. For example, 
deathless can be turned or destroyed by an evil cleric, making Improved 
Turn Resistance an excellent choice for a powerful Undying councilor. 
Positive Energy Resistance could be converted to Negative Energy 
Resistance for the deathless. Lifebond can be used to represent the 
strength a deathless gains from a particularly faithful follower (most 
likely a descendant), while Lifesense reflects its ability to perceive 
the positive energy that flows through living things. </p>
<p align="left">The Tomb Warden prestige class is appropriate for the 
deathless, especially the Undying Soldiers who guard the City of the 
Dead. The Death's Chosen prestige class could be modified to become the 
Chosen of the Deathless. Remove the alignment restriction (as most 
deathless are good), but leave the Unnatural Aura. Even though they are 
animated by positive energy, the deathless are still unnatural beings. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Vampires of the Blood of Vol</b></p>
<p align="left">The faith of the Blood of Vol is based on the idea that 
the undead are champions of the church. Worshippers willingly give their
 blood to vampires to strengthen them in battle. <i>Libris Mortis</i> introduces new systems for undead sustenance. </p>
<p align="left">According to <i>Libris Mortis</i>, the greatest force 
driving a vampire is its inescapable craving for life energy -- a hunger
 far more lethal to the victim than a little gift of blood. This is a 
considerable sacrifice on the part of the faithful, and one that would 
quickly decimate Blood of Vol sects. Because of this, vampires 
associated with the Blood of Vol should have a lesser craving for life 
energy. While they still require it to survive, the satiation period is 
seven days, the Will DC save is 15, and damage is reduced to 1d4 Wisdom.
 The simplest solution is to apply this to all vampires in the setting, 
but at the DM's discretion there could be another strain of vampirism --
 undead whose roots can be traced back to the Qabalrin have this lesser 
craving, while those created by Katashka have an unquenchable thirst.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead as Characters</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Libris Mortis </i>provides class breakdowns for many 
of the common undead. An undead character can provide many interesting 
opportunities for roleplaying: once a Silver Flame paladin, you were 
slain only to rise as a ghoul; you have managed to overcome your bestial
 instincts, but what do you do now? Alternatively, you may be one of the
 champions of the Blood of Vol, granted the powers of undeath to defend 
the living. You have been disheartened to discover the corruption within
 your own church, but you still believe in your cause. </p>
<p align="left">Undead characters will have a difficult time in the Five
 Nations unless they are able to conceal their condition. Not 
surprisingly, most people consider the undead to be dangerous monsters, 
and any of the groups mentioned in this article might attempt to destroy
 an undead character. Even those who don't fight or flee will generally 
be unfriendly at best, with the notable exceptions of followers or the 
Blood of Vol or the people of Droaam, who are surprisingly cosmopolitan 
in their views. </p>
<p align="left">To make matters worse, the undead have no rights under 
the Code of Galifar. If you're a ghoul, a priest of Dol Arrah can 
destroy you with no legal consequences. It's a hard path to follow, but 
it can certainly make for an interesting journey.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Monsters of <i>Libris Mortis</i></b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Libris Mortis</i> presents dozens of new monsters, 
and examining them all would take an article in its own right. Here are 
suggestions for how a few of these creatures could be placed in Eberron.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Dream Vestige</i> is supposedly formed from the death of an 
entire city. It is a perfect match for the Mournland, where hundreds of 
thousands were killed. Powerful quori may possess the ability to control
 dream vestiges, which would add a deadly weapon to the arsenal of the 
Dreaming Dark. The vestige's <i>dream travel</i> ability lets it strike anywhere in the world without warning!<br><br></li>
<li>The <i>Boneyard </i>is another creature that could be found in the 
Mournland or elsewhere in the Five Nations, especially on battlefields 
where large armies of Karrnathi undead were defeated. <br><br></li>
<li>The <i>Evolved Undead</i> template can be an interesting way to make
 ancient powers such as Erandis d'Vol and the vampire lords of the 
Qabalrin even deadlier than expected. After forty thousand years of 
evolution, a Qabalrin vampire might possess +12 turn resistance, fast 
healing 18, and a half-dozen spell-like abilities!<br><br></li>
<li>The city of Sharaat was destroyed by the death curses of a group of 
mighty aberrant lords, including the infamous Lady of the Plague. The 
city of Sharn was built over the ruins of Sharaat, and many say that her
 curse still lingers in the depths. As a result, the <i>Bloodmote Cloud, Bone Rat Swarm, Corpse Rat Swarm,</i> or<i> Dire Maggot </i>could
 all be found beneath the city. Perhaps some part of the Lady of the 
Plague survived her death -- this would be an excellent opportunity to 
place a powerful <i>Swarm Shifter </i>deep below Sharn. It may have 
taken her centuries to take this form, but now that she is back she 
releases disease and a wave of undead vermin on the world above to gain 
vengeance on the dragonmarked houses that destroyed her!<i></i></li>
</ul>
