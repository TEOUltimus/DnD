<p align="left">The <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953747200">Player's Handbook II</a></i> sourcebook provides new classes, character options, and inspiration for <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </b>
 players. The majority of this material is setting-neutral. The chapters
 on building character identity, developing adventuring groups, and 
rebuilding characters are universal and equally useful to all players 
and Dungeon Masters.</p>
<p align="left">When it comes to new feats, spells, and class options, 
DM and player should work together to decide how to add this new 
material into the campaign. A DM may choose to make all of these options
 available to all characters, with no need for special training. 
Alternatively, a DM may wish to restrict new material to certain 
cultures or organizations, requiring a character to seek out a mentor of
 that culture to take advantage of the option.</p>
<p align="left"><b>New Character Classes</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Player's Handbook II </i>presents four new classes 
for player characters: the cunning beguiler, the stoic dragon shaman, 
the deadly duskblade, and the bold knight. While a character of any race
 or background can choose one of these paths, each class is well suited 
to certain cultures and nations; here are a few suggestions to help 
place these classes in the world. Bear in mind that characters with PC 
classes are always remarkable; while the beguiler is an excellent match 
for the Royal Eyes of Aundair, the majority of the Royal Eyes will be 
mundane experts or expert/beguilers. A high-level beguiler is an 
exceptional agent and a worthy adversary for the PCs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Beguiler </b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-11%20-%20Player%27s%20Handbook%20II_files/eb0911ee_beguiler.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="242" width="240">The
 beguiler specializes in stealth and deception, merging mundane skill 
with a versatile selection of spells. A beguiler makes an exceptional 
spy; in addition to her talent for illusion and enchantment, spells such
 as <i>detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance, </i>and <i>sending </i>allow
 her to pluck information from enemy strongholds and relay it back to 
her superiors. In a world where magic has long been part of 
civilization, a few organizations are especially likely to produce 
beguilers. A player character could begin as an agent of one of these 
forces; alternatively, one of these groups may recognize her talents and
 seek to recruit her over the course of a campaign.</p>
<p align="left">Among the common races, one of the oldest beguiler 
traditions is that of House Phiarlan -- a tradition now shared with 
House Thuranni. The Phiarlans were spies long before the Mark of Shadows
 appeared, and some of the practices of the Phiarlan beguilers date back
 to the fall of Xen'drik.</p>
<p align="left">Given their natural gift for illusions and love of 
intrigue, it should come as no surprise that the gnomes of Zilargo make 
excellent beguilers. While many Zil gnomes prefer the path of the bard, 
the talents of the beguiler are better suited for pure espionage; as a 
result, many of the top corliganos ("roving ears") of the Trust are 
beguilers.</p>
<p align="left">Within the Five Nations, Aundair has the longest 
tradition of arcane magic, and the Royal Eyes of Aundair has been 
building an elite corps of beguilers. While beguilers exist in other 
nations, the spies of Breland and Karrnath typically prefer the raw 
skill and deadly sneak attack of the rogue to the arcane tricks of the 
beguiler.</p>
<p align="left">Not all beguilers are spies, and not all develop their 
gifts as a result of training. In Droaam and the Shadow Marches, a few 
children spontaneously manifest beguiler talents; traditionally, these 
gifts are seen as the touch of the Dark Six, and these youths are often 
claimed by priests and raised to revere the Six. These natural beguilers
 are known as <i>sheelidar </i>-- "six-fingered hands" -- and a few 
actually do have an extra digit on hands and feet. While they are taught
 to use their powers in the service of the Dark Six, sheelidar are not 
always evil; many simply believe that the Six are wild and primal 
forces, and that the civilized followers of the Sovereign Host are 
afraid of the passion and energy of the Six.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, a few races in the <b>Eberron</b> setting often
 produce beguilers. Doppelgangers and changelings are foremost among 
these, and at the DM's discretion, a player with a changeling PC can 
take beguiler as his favored class instead of rogue. The other force 
known for its beguilers are the rakshasa. As the rakshasa are known as 
spirits of deception, a DM may chose to give a rakshasa the spellcasting
 abilities of a beguiler instead of a sorcerer -- although to gain any 
of the other class abilities of a beguiler, the rakshasa will need to 
take levels in the class.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Dragon Shaman</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-11%20-%20Player%27s%20Handbook%20II_files/eb0911ee_dragonshaman.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="274" width="240">Though
 rarely seen, dragons are known across Eberron as symbols of magic and 
power. The dragon shaman exists in many different cultures. Some worship
 the first children of Eberron and Siberys, while others simply seek the
 power of these mighty creatures. A few of these forces are described 
below.</p>
<p align="left">The barbarians of the Seren Islands produce a remarkable
 number of dragon shamans. Each of the Seren tribes reveres a draconic 
founder, and those shamans who can draw on the strength of the founder 
are considered truly blessed. Many of the most gifted dragon shamans 
follow a call into the heart of Aerenal itself; some say that these 
heroes serve in the kingdom of wyrms, while others believe that they are
 sent out into the wider world to do the bidding of their dragon 
masters.</p>
<p align="left">Many know the legend of the Storm Guardians, the clan of
 blue dragons who are said to live atop the highest peak in Adar and to 
protect the land from its enemies. But another tale that few beyond Adar
 have heard sometimes gets passed along in whispers among those of Adar.
 A hidden valley high on Korrandar is home to an order of monks chosen 
long ago by the first Guardians. According to the tale, these monks 
study the ways of the dragon until they become dragons themselves; if 
the legend is true, some of the dragons soaring above the clouds of Adar
 are dragon shamans who have undergone a remarkable apotheosis. A few 
bold adventures have gone in search of this Valley of Dragons; to date, 
none have returned.</p>
<p align="left">There are many different interpretations of the 
Sovereign Host. One cult asserts that the Sovereigns are in fact 
dragons, children of the first age who ascended to a state beyond mortal
 understanding. Priests of this sect may become dragon shamans instead 
of clerics or adepts, assuming the traits of their divine patron. For 
example, a shaman dedicated to Aureon would take the blue dragon as his 
patron. The dragons associated with the Sovereigns can be found on pages
 68-69 of the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>. At the moment this is an obscure sect, but recently the cult has been gaining support in Stormreach.</p>
<p align="left">In the Shadow Marches, tales speak of the duraak'al, 
warriors with the strength of the black dragon. Such orcs are said to 
carry the blessing of the dragon Vvaraak, the wyrm who prepared the orcs
 for the war against Xoriat. Today the duraak'al are a thing of legend .
 . . but it's always possible those legends will rise again!</p>
<p align="left"> Dragon shamans are also found among the kobolds, where 
they vie with sorcerers for positions of spiritual leadership. Finally, 
tales from Q'barra suggest that dragon shamans exist among the 
lizardfolk of that distant tribe -- priests who revere the dragon 
Rhashaak as a living god.</p>
<p align="left">While it may seem that dragon shamans who adopt the 
physical traits of their totems will stand out in Khorvaire, there are 
many strange things in the world. In a land where shifters and 
changelings are part of daily life, and ogres, gargoyles, and even 
medusas live or travel within major cities, a human with faint scales 
isn't terribly noteworthy. A dragon shaman can stand out in a crowd, but
 she is unlikely to suffer any sort of prejudice due to her appearance.</p>
<p align="left">According to the <i>Player's Handbook II</i>, the 
alignment of a dragon shaman must be within one step of the dragon he 
emulates. However, in Eberron, the alignment of a dragon is not fixed by
 its color -- nor are worshipers traditionally bound by the alignment of
 their deities. As such, a DM may wish to remove the alignment 
restriction. With that said, dragon shamans should typically follow the <i>perceived </i>alignment
 of their draconic patrons. For example, although blue dragons can be 
any alignment, the Storm Guardians of Adar are seen as noble beings -- 
so a dragon shaman who emulates these blue wyrms will usually be good.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Duskblade</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-11%20-%20Player%27s%20Handbook%20II_files/eb0911ee_duskblade.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="221" width="240">The duskblade combines magic with the art of war. The <i>Player's Handbook II</i>
 describes the duskblade as an elf tradition, and this certainly fits in
 Eberron. Some of the greatest heroes of the ancient elf-giant conflict 
were duskblades, and today these arcane warriors work both among the 
champions of Aerenal and the Tairnadal elves of Valenar, where they ride
 side by side with rangers and true wizards.</p>
<p align="left">However, the elves aren't the only culture to produce 
duskblades. A recent Morgrave expedition has produced evidence 
suggesting that the giants had duskblades of their own. Before the 
Inspired conquest of Sarlona, duskblades existed in the human kingdom of
 Ohr Kaluun; this tradition may have survived among the refugees of this
 fallen land, either in the depths of the Lhazaar Principalities, the 
monasteries of Adar, or the crumbling war mazes of Ohr Kaluun itself.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, the duskblade is ideally suited to the martial 
sensibilities of Aundair, which combines a deep respect for magic with a
 love for flair and color in battle. While Aundair has yet to produce a 
duskblade who can match the masters of Aerenal and Valenar, a player 
character could prove to be the exception to this rule!</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Knight</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-11%20-%20Player%27s%20Handbook%20II_files/eb0911ee_knight.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="256" width="240">In
 the golden age of Galifar, noble knights existed across Khorvaire. In 
the wake of the Last War, knights still live in any land, but the flower
 of chivalry blooms in two nations that remain bitter rivals -- Thrane 
and Karrnath. Both nations have always held discipline and martial 
excellence in high regard, and both favor styles of combat well suited 
to the knight; Thrane's heavy cavalry is unequalled in the land, while 
the armored infantry of Karrnath is rightfully feared by all. By 
contrast, while one can find knights in the other five nations, 
Aundair's love of magic often distracts from the pure martial discipline
 of the knight, while the pragmatic Brelish often let honor slide for 
the sake of expediency. Only a handful of Cyran knights survived the 
Mourning, but these proud soldiers are often remarkable individuals; 
having lost their land, all they have left is their honor, and they will
 not lose that too.</p>
<p align="left">While great tension exists between the common people of 
Thrane and Karrnath, the knights of these two lands often hold one 
another in high regard; they may be enemies, but at least they are 
worthy opponents. Recently, King Kaius III has been working with 
Flamekeep to arrange a series of grand melees, in the hopes of 
strengthening this bond and furthering the cause of peace.</p>
<p align="left">Beyond the Five Nations, a few of the dwarves of Clan 
Mroranon adopted the traditions of the knight for Karrnath during the 
Last War; in the wake of the Mror secession, a bitter rivalry often 
flares up between dwarf and Karrnathi knights. A few knights are among 
the Valenar, but less than one might expect to find in that martial 
culture. In their war against the giants, the elves of old found 
themselves relying on commando tactics; thus more elves follow the path 
of the ranger or scout.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Expanded Classes and New Feats</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Player's Handbook II </i>presents new options for 
every class, along with a host of new feats. At the DM's discretion, 
these options could be available to all characters; any barbarian could 
choose berserk strength in place of rage, regardless of the traditions 
of his tribe. But certain cultures and organizations may be especially 
prone to their use; a few examples are given below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Arcane Thesis. </b>In Khorvaire, Arcane Thesis is 
typically seen among the wizards of the Arcane Congress; the long 
magical traditions of Aundair help those who choose to focus on a 
specific field of study. Beyond Khorvaire, the elves of Aerenal are also
 fond of Arcane Thesis, reflecting their obsession with perfecting 
specific skills.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Blood of Vol. </b>The followers of the Blood of 
Vol place a tremendous importance on the spiritual power of blood. As 
such, priests of the Blood of Vol should be eligible to take the Ritual 
Blood Bond feat, regardless of race. This bond of blood also can be 
reflected with the Divine Ward feat, allowing priests of the blood to 
aid their followers from a distance. Finally, many clerics of the Blood 
of Vol use the spontaneous domain casting option (page 37), usually 
focusing on the Necromancer domain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Church of the Silver Flame. </b>As a religion of 
light, Sacred Purification and Sacred Radiance are especially 
appropriate for clerics of the Silver Flame. While many of the priests 
of Thrane are often experts instead of adepts or clerics, several do 
possess the Ritual Blessing feat, which allows them to aid their 
followers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>House Ghallanda. </b>While the House of Hospitality 
is often seen as a harmless force, heirs of the house are often 
exceptionally skilled at the arts of conversation. Both Master 
Manipulator and Wanderer's Diplomacy are often used by Ghallanda 
characters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>House Vadalis. </b>The House of Handling is 
interested in all forms of interaction between magic and the animal 
world. While many war-wizards of the Five Nations prefer Immediate Magic
 (page 68), wizards of House Vadalis invariably possess familiars, and 
the house is an excellent place to learn the familiar-enhancing feats 
presented in <i>Player's Handbook II.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Infernal and Celestial Sorcerers. </b>While there is 
limited traffic between Eberron and the Outer Planes, there are many 
ways to use these feats. A sorcerer born in a manifest zone may develop 
heritage feats in spite of there being no blood connection to an 
outsider. A celestial sorcerer may channel the power of the Silver 
Flame, being a living link to this divine force. Likewise, it's possible
 that the sorcerer actually has been touched by the pure power of Khyber
 or Siberys, becoming a vessel for the light or darkness of the world 
itself. An infernal sorcerer will have an easy time finding a place 
within the Cults of the Dragon Below or working with the Lords of Dust; a
 celestial sorcerer might work with a church or the Chamber, or find her
 own path.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Mironite Monks. </b>Almost unknown outside of 
Thrane, the Mironite monks are a sect of martial ascetics who have 
learned to channel the power of the Silver Flame through their own flesh
 and spirit. On Khorvaire, the Mironites are the primary users of the 
Fiery Fist, Fiery <i>Ki</i> Defense, and <i>Ki</i> Blast feats.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sovereign Host. </b>Since priests of the 
Sovereign Host can turn to many deities for inspiration, they can use 
almost any of the new feats presented in <i>Player's Handbook II</i>. A 
paladin of Dol Arrah may use Divine Justice or Sacred Radiance, while a 
cleric sworn to Dol Dorn is more likely to draw on Divine Armor. Clerics
 who are particularly dedicated to a specific Sovereign typically use 
the Spontaneous Domain Casting option; a cleric of Onatar has little 
talent for healing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>War Magic of Karrnath. </b>Recognizing the power of 
Aundair, the wizards of Karrnath have fought to ramp up their own war 
magic over the last few decades. While Karrnathi wizards often lack the 
finesse and scholarly nature of their Aundairian counterparts, they are 
grim and determined. Arcane Toughness and Arcane Consumption are both 
techniques employed by the Karrns, along with the new metamagic feats 
presented in the <i>Player's Handbook II</i>. The majority of Karrnathi wizards use the Immediate Magic class option; in times of war, a familiar often gets in the way.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weapon Supremacy. </b>No known hero possesses this 
level of skill, and a PC who attains this level of mastery should be 
celebrated far and wide for her remarkable talent. The last known 
supreme swordmaster within the Five Nations was Drago ir'Loran of 
Karrnath, who personally trained the young King Jarot before the Last 
War.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, it's possible that beings out there may have 
this level of skill but have chosen to conceal it; there may be a zakya 
lord on the Council of Ashtakala who is waiting for the day when a 
mortal will learn the skills to actually prove a challenge with a blade.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Zil. </b>The gnomes of Zilargo are renowned for 
their love of intrigue and skill with alchemy. Master Manipulator and 
Wanderer's Diplomacy are both highly appropriate for Zil characters. In 
addition, Zilargo is a very logical place to find the Grenadier and Mad 
Alchemist feats. Zil bards love to weave magic and illusion into their 
performances, and the Arcane Flourish feat is a good way to represent 
this.</p>
