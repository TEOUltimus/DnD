<p align="left">This installment of <i>Eberron Expanded</i> focuses on adapting the material from <i>Weapons of Legacy </i>for use in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>
 introduces legacy items -- magic items with the potential to rival 
artifacts in power, though not all of that potential is available to the
 user right away. Instead, the power of the item grows with that of the 
possessor. Furthermore, only those who uncover the history of the item 
and perform rites and rituals to honor its legacy can uncover and use 
its greatest powers. </p>
<p align="left">Typically, only the greatest powers of Eberron -- such 
as the dragons of Argonnessen, the giants of Xen'drik, or the fallen 
rajahs of the Age of Demons -- can produce artifacts. However, a legacy 
item could emerge from any source, empowered by the history it has 
helped to create. For example, Malleon the Reaver bathed the shores of 
Khorvaire in goblin blood, and his axe <i>Redwave</i> still harbors the shadow of his hatred within it. The <i>Crown of Galifar,</i>
 missing now for almost a century, is an item of great power, but only 
wearer who has proven her worthiness to rule can harness its true 
potential.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to these random items plucked from the hands
 of history's heroes, two particular cultures are highly appropriate as 
sources for legacy items: the Dhakaani Empire and the Tairnadal elves.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Empire of Dhakaan </b></p>
<p align="left">The Dhakaani goblinoids ruled Khorvaire for seven 
thousand years before the Xoriat incursion shattered the proud 
civilization they had built. This goblin nation devoted itself to the 
art of war -- both its practice and its tools -- and its armorers and 
weaponsmiths were among the finest the world has ever seen. The Dhakaani
 worshiped no gods; rather, they revered the empire itself, recounting 
the deeds and history of the great heroes who defined it for all to 
hear.</p>
<p align="left">Taken together, these facts present a compelling case 
for a strong tradition of legacy items among the Dhakaani. Charged with 
the history of the empire -- the conquest of Khorvaire, the wars with 
elves and demons, and the final, disastrous conflict with the daelkyr --
 these weapons were made for goblin hands, though they could serve any 
noble warrior equally well. Today, the Heirs of Dhakaan -- the clans 
that went into hiding as the great goblinoid empire began to crumble -- 
are searching for these ancient relics, which could aid them 
substantially in re-establishing their former glory. </p>
<p align="left">Most Dhakaani legacy items probably lie amid the ruins 
of the empire, though a fair number could also be buried in ancient 
battlefields. Since the Dhakaani have an austere culture devoted 
primarily to war, most of their legacy items are likely to be arms or 
armor, though instruments of the duur'kala bards or regalia worn by 
great generals or emperors would also be appropriate. </p>
<p align="left">The legacy rituals for these items should be tied to war
 and might range from performing a small act of courage to playing a 
decisive role as the architect of a battle. When designing a ritual, 
keep in mind that the Dhakaani were not simple warmongers. One of the 
cornerstones of their culture was the premise that the strong (bugbears 
and hobgoblins) must protect the weak (goblins), so a weapon or shield 
might require a sacrifice in keeping with this philosophy.</p>
<p align="left">Each Dhakaani legacy item is a piece of goblin history 
that the goblins want back, so carrying one presents a danger to any 
nongoblinoid character. A typical city goblin or soldier of the 
Ghaal'duur might not recognize the item, but the Heirs of Dhakaan would 
certainly be offended by an outsider who presumed to steal one of the 
empire's great treasures and wield it as his own. A character who works 
with the Heirs of Dhakaan might eventually earn enough respect to be 
considered an honorary goblin -- and thus a worthy bearer of the legacy 
item -- but considerable bloodshed is likely to occur first.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dhakanni Legacy Items</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2011-28%20-%20Weapons%20of%20Legacy_files/eb1128ee_fiendkiller.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="222" width="206">With a few changes, the following specific items from <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>
 could be appropriate for the Dhakaani. The Eberron history of each item
 is given first, followed by a bulleted list of changes needed to adapt 
it. If no such list is given, the item's powers remain the same.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fiendkiller's Flail</b></p>
<p align="left">This weapon was originally forged to battle the Lords of
 Dust. Later, the smiths enhanced its power when the legions of Xoriat 
invaded.</p>
<ul>
<li> Add byeshk to the weapon's scourge of fiends ability.</li>
<li> Change sense fiends to detect evil outsiders with the native subtype, extraplanar creatures from Xoriat, or aberrations.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Guurgal</b></p>
<p align="left">Since the orcs of Eberron do not have the same militant 
tradition as the goblinoids do, Guurgal was not the weapon of an orcish 
horde. Rather, it was wielded by one of the first emperors, who put out 
his own eye in a display of courage and resolve. </p>
<ul>
<li> Change all orc and half-orc references to goblinoid. </li>
<li> The ritual for the lesser legacy involves communing with the spirits of the ancient emperors rather than Gruumsh. </li>
<li> The greater legacy ritual requires seeking out the shade of Emperor
 Bruug Dhakaan, which has been trapped in the Lair of the Keeper. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Skull Lash</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2011-28%20-%20Weapons%20of%20Legacy_files/eb1128ee_skulllash.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="137" width="236">The <i>Skull Lash</i>
 predates the empire. Despite its disturbing appearance, it was often 
borne by the emperor or the wisest of the duur'kala, who used its 
abilities to gain insight.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wargird's Armor</b></p>
<p align="left">Built for a Dhakaani officer, this armor bonded with the
 spirit of an orc berserker from the Shadow Marches who was slain during
 one of the empire's efforts to create a buffer zone on its western 
border.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Options</b></p>
<p align="left">The above items are just a few examples of weapons from 
the book that can relate to the Dhakanni Empire, but many other items 
could easily be adapted as well. In particular, since chain weapons are 
common among the Dhakaani, a spiked chain would make an excellent weapon
 of legacy. Alternatively, an existing weapon from the book could be 
converted to a spiked chain. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Tairnadal</b></p>
<p align="left">The warrior culture of the Tairnadal elves gave birth to
 the nation of Valenar. Every Tairnadal devotes himself to the memory of
 a particular ancestor and seeks to honor and emulate that person's 
great deeds throughout his own life. </p>
<p align="left">Such a culture is a perfect match for the items in <i>Weapons of Legacy.</i>
 Any elf who can reclaim a treasured possession of an ancient elf hero 
is certain to devote himself to mastering its history and its power. </p>
<p align="left">Since the Tairnadal are accomplished archers, riders, 
and masters of stealth and guerrilla warfare, any weapons or items tied 
to these functions could be especially appropriate for a Tairnadal 
legacy. But although the Tairnadal have a martial culture, they also 
respect the role that arcane magic can play in battle, and they are fond
 of decorative clothing and jewelry. Thus, almost any item could qualify
 as a Tairnadal legacy item.</p>
<p align="left">If desired, you could restrict the use of elven items of
 legacy to elf champions. Since the bearer is drawing on the memory of 
the heroic elf who first used the item, it may not respond to people of 
other races. However, a human or other creature might someday be able to
 earn the respect of the ancient spirit, and thus the right to carry on 
the legacy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tarinadal Legacy Items</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2011-28%20-%20Weapons%20of%20Legacy_files/eb1128ee_desertwind.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="300" width="88">While any legacy weapon can be adapted to the Tairnadal with a few adjustments, a few of the items mentioned in <i>Weapons of Legacy</i>
 are especially well suited to the history of the elves. None of these 
items require changes to their powers -- only to their histories.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bow of the Black Archer</b></p>
<p align="left">Many drow served the giants in the ancient Xen'drik 
uprising, using the powers of darkness to battle their cousins. In 
Eberron, Shevarash did not become a god, but he was a legendary archer 
who slew hundreds of drow. In fact, many say it was his wrath that 
struck down Valderion. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Desert Wind</b></p>
<p align="left">This item was the tool of a great elf prince in the dry 
regions of Xen'drik -- one of the first provinces to stand against the 
giants. <i>Desert Wind</i> was lost when the Tairnadal first came to the
 Blade Desert ten thousand years ago, and the Valenar are still combing 
the land for any sign of it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stalker's Bow</b></p>
<p align="left">The elf huntress Failine acquired this weapon from a 
drow assassin, who used it to prey on elf rebels. After reaching 
Aerenal, however, the bow quickly disappeared. Rumor holds that the <i>Stalker's Bow</i> is now in the hands of House Thuranni, but wherever it is, the Tairnadal descendents of Failine would like it back.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Options</b></p>
<p align="left">In addition to the above choices, a few objects unique 
to the Tairnadal culture would make excellent legacy items. You can 
adapt items from the book to use these forms, or simply build new ones.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Valenar Double Scimitar:</b> The history of this weapon (described on page 119 of the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>) dates back to Xen'drik, and Tairnadal warriors take great pride in their skill with it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Zaelshin:</b> The zaelshin, or spirit bond, is an 
amulet bearing the sigil of a Tairnadal elf's patron ancestor. The 
zaelshin tu is a similar brooch that holds an actual physical relic of 
the ancestor -- usually a sliver of bone or a tooth. A zaelshin tu makes
 an excellent legacy item, but only an elf with a bond to the item's 
particular patron ancestor should be able to unlock its powers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Zaelta:</b> The zaelta, or spirit mask, is a veil 
that covers the lower face. It is intended to help the wearer submerge 
his identity in that of his ancestor. A zaelta that once served as a 
shroud for the ancestor could easily hold a powerful legacy. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Legacy Feats and Legacy Champions</b></p>
<p align="left">As members of the cultures with the longest histories, 
Dhakaani goblins and Tairnadal elves are the logical choices for legacy 
champions, and they probably developed most, if not all, of the legacy 
feats. However, members of other cultures could certainly learn the same
 skills through contact with those civilizations. For example, a member 
of the Wayfinder Foundation who has lived among the Dhakaani might have 
studied the tradition of the legacy guardian and then applied it to his 
own weapon, <i>Bloodwave.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Founding a Legacy</b></p>
<p align="left">In the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting, </i>the 
player characters are supposed to be the greatest heroes of the age -- 
or, at least, they have the potential to become such. Thus, it is 
entirely appropriate for their deeds to create new legacies, which may 
be passed down into future generations. Legacy creation is especially 
appropriate for heroes who are facing the greatest villains of Eberron. 
The blade that strikes down a daelkyr lord, the shield that stands 
against Erandis d'Vol, the hammer that shatters the sword wielded by the
 Lord of Blades -- these are the items that give birth to legends. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Warforged as Legacy Items</b></p>
<p align="left">Eberron allows one intriguing option not found in other 
settings: the warforged. The body of a warforged can be enhanced just as
 if it were a suit of magic armor. A warforged character who becomes a 
legacy item may have been created for some secret purpose he knows 
nothing about. Infused with power by Onatar and the Dragon Above, he 
must bide his time until his true destiny is revealed. </p>
<p align="left">Allowing warforged to become legacy items is an option 
that a DM must carefully consider before allowing it in her campaign. 
After all, a legacy cannot easily be taken away or destroyed, but it 
could certainly make encounters with the Lord of Blades more 
interesting! </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Monsters of Legacy</b></p>
<p align="left">The concept of monsters of legacy is highly appropriate 
for Eberron. Kazdurakashtan is a dragon -- a Chamber observer who was 
hidden in Cyre when the Mourning struck, and was twisted into a far more
 terrible creature. Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes, is one of the most 
terrifying of the daelkyr. The Children of Winter tell tales of 
Coldfang, a dire serpent infused with the raw power of the Gloaming. And
 tales of the night hag Sora Kell have been used to terrify children 
since humans first came to Khorvaire. These creatures are the most 
obvious monsters of legacy, but many other legendary creatures could 
also be lurking in the shadows of Eberron, just waiting for new heroes 
to emerge!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Other Weapons of Legacy</b></p>
<p align="left">The Tairnadal and Dhakaani sections above mention only a few specific items from <i>Weapons of Legacy,</i> but translating any object presented in the book into one suitable for your Eberron campaign is a simple matter. For example, <i>Infiltrator</i> could be tied into the split between House Phiarlan and House Thuranni, or even an elven betrayal dating back to Xen'drik. <i>Mau-Jehe</i> could have been forged by the first kalashtar, and the <i>Simple Bow</i> could have its roots in the monasteries of Adar. <i>Full Moon's Trick, </i>a remnant of one of the fallen innocents of the Lycanthropic Purge, might be hidden among the shifters of the Eldeen Reaches. <i>Dymondheart</i> could have been handed down from Gatekeeper to Gatekeeper, while <i>Treebrother</i> might actually be a shaft cut from the Great Druid Oalian himself. Just use your imagination!</p>
