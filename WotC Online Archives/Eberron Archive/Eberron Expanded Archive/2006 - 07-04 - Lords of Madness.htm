<p align="left">This first installment of Keith Baker's new <i>Eberron Expanded</i> column focuses on adapting material from <i>Lords of Madness: </i>the Book of Aberrations, for use in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Overview: The Role of Aberrations in Eberron</b></p>
<p align="left">In Eberron, all aberrations share a common bond. 
Thousands of years ago, beings known as the daelkyr led an extraplanar 
incursion into Eberron. True lords of madness, these shapers of flesh 
brought with them a host of horrors from the plane of Xoriat. As the 
daelkyr sank their talons into Eberron, they twisted and corrupted any 
other creatures unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches. 
Eventually, the shapers of flesh were defeated and sealed in the 
underworld of Khyber, where they continue to create new terrors even 
now.</p>
<p align="left">But the daelkyr were not responsible for all of 
Eberron's aberrations. According to myth, the world was formed from 
three dragons. Eberron, the Dragon Between, is the source of all natural
 creatures, and Khyber, the Dragon Below, spawns fiends and aberrations.
 So while the daelkyr create monsters in the darkness of the underworld,
 Khyber continues to generate horrors of its own.</p>
<p align="left">Although many aberrations -- including beholders, mind 
flayers, and grell -- are natives of Xoriat brought to Eberron by the 
daelkyr, their creature type remains aberration, not outsider. Just as 
elementals and lycanthropes can be found on Lamannia and fey exist in 
Thelanis, aberrations have a place in Xoriat.</p>
<p align="left">Except for matters relating to history, the material in <i>Lords of Madness</i> dovetails quite nicely with that in the <b>Eberron</b>
 books. For example, aboleth tactics, glyphs, and feats can be taken 
directly from the book, but a DM wishing to use these creatures must 
decide how they fit into the history of Eberron, Khyber, and Xoriat. The
 following sections look at each of the chapters in <i>Lords of Madness</i> and suggest ways to adapt the featured aberrations for use in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Aboleths</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2007-04%20-%20Lords%20of%20Madness_files/ee_0605_aboleth.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="176" width="306">According to <i>Lords of Madness,</i>
 the civilization of the aboleths is the most ancient in existence. The 
memories of these creatures stretch back to a time before time, and they
 can recall ancient evils that have long since faded from human 
knowledge. Only a few simple changes are needed to adapt this concept 
for use in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. </p>
<p align="left">The mythology of Eberron mentions a war that took place 
at the dawn of time. Most legends speak of the rakshasas as the first 
fiends and refer to them as the most ancient enemies of the light. But 
these creatures were not the only children of Khyber -- the oceans 
became home to the aboleths at about the same time as the first 
rakshasas were created. The rakshasas ruled the land, but the aboleths 
held sway in the deep waters, unknown to all but a few. Both battled 
dragons and couatls, and in time, both saw the Elder Evils cast down and
 bound by the Silver Flame. After this defeat, the aboleths retreated to
 the depths where no dragon could follow them. In the hundreds of 
millennia since, they have slowly returned, spreading their influence 
across the world. Now the aboleths wait for the day when the Silver 
Flame will gutter and die, allowing the Elder Evils to return and claim 
the world as their own.</p>
<p align="left">If you accept this version of Eberron's history, the 
aboleths become contemporaries of the Lords of Dust and enemies of the 
Chamber and the Church of the Silver Flame. The Elder Evils -- those 
ancient powers bound by the Silver Flame -- are also known as the 
rakshasa rajahs, though this latter name is simply a title. Eberron's 
history portrays these overlords as unique spirits with powers far 
beyond those of any rakshasa, and the Elder Evils detailed in <i>Lords of Madness</i>
 certainly fill the bill. Thus, they can also serve as the powers behind
 the Lords of Dust and the Carrion Tribes of the Demon Wastes.</p>
<p align="left">Like the dragons and the rakshasas, the aboleths have 
the perspective required to study and understand the Draconic Prophecy 
fully, and they have discovered segments of it hidden in the deep 
waters. Like the rakshasas, the aboleths seek vengeance against the 
dragons and intend to twist the path of the Draconic Prophecy. As a 
result, characters working for the Chamber can easily be drawn into 
conflict with aboleths and their agents.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Beholders</b></p>
<p align="left">Beholders served as living artillery during the daelkyr 
incursion, using the terrible power of their eyes to shatter whole 
goblin armies. In <b>Eberron,</b> beholders do not reproduce naturally 
and have not created a culture of their own -- they are simply the 
immortal servants of the daelkyr. Most continue to serve their masters, 
commanding subterranean outposts of aberrations or serving as the hidden
 leaders of various Cults of the Dragon Below. Others lead solitary 
lives, contemplating mysteries or studying the world. Such lone 
beholders may manipulate humanoid communities, but their actions are 
rarely driven by a desire for personal power. </p>
<p align="left">Aside from the material dealing with beholder culture and reproduction, all the information presented in <i>Lords of Madness</i>
 applies to the beholders of Eberron. Members of the Cults of the Dragon
 Below believe that these creatures function as the eyes of a greater 
power. Some insist that they serve Belashyrra, a powerful daelkyr who is
 also known as the Lord of Eyes. Others claim the beholders are the eyes
 of Xoriat itself -- that while they serve the daelkyr, they are 
conduits to a power even greater and more terrible than the shapers of 
flesh.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mind Flayers</b></p>
<p align="left">The mind flayers are the chief servants of the daelkyr. 
The elder brains may be daelkyr creations, or they may actually be 
spiritual and physical extensions of the daelkyr. In either case, the 
elder brains form the backbone of the telepathic network that links the 
daelkyr together and allows them to monitor their servants. </p>
<p align="left">Eberron is not the first world that the daelkyr have 
attacked. It is possible that the mind flayers were created when the 
daelkyr destroyed the native world of the gith races. If so, the 
githzerai and githyanki are descendants of those few survivors who fled 
to Kythri and the Astral Plane, while the mind flayers are descended 
from survivors of the progenitor race who were twisted in the same 
manner as the dolgaunts and dolgrims.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Neogi</b></p>
<p align="left">Once, a mighty dwarven empire lay beneath the Ironroot 
Mountains. The founders of the modern Mror clans were exiles from this 
kingdom. When their descendants finally returned to the depths, they 
discovered that their ancestral homeland had been annihilated by the 
daelkyr long ago. But some traces of that ruined kingdom remain -- and 
among those remnants are the neogi. </p>
<p align="left">Just as the dolgaunts were created from hobgoblins, the 
neogi were created from dwarves. Though the neogi bear no physical 
resemblance to their predecessor race, the greed that burns at the heart
 of the dwarven psyche remains, driving the neogi to consume and 
control. </p>
<p align="left">Until recently, the neogi were only a legend. Perhaps 
they had slumbered for a time and were finally awakened when dwarf 
explorers ventured too far into the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. 
Now, however, the neogi can appear anywhere in northwestern Khorvaire. 
Their tunnels stretch far from the Ironroots, and neogi raiders have 
been encountered in the Lhazaar Principalities, Karrnath, and the 
Talenta Plains. </p>
<p align="left">Although the neogi are surely daelkyr creations, they 
have no direct tie to the lords of Xoriat in the present day. Thus, the 
neogi culture from <i>Lords of Madness</i> is usable as is, except that 
neogi ships do not travel between worlds. It is quite possible, however,
 that the daelkyr possess an as-yet-unrevealed ability to control the 
neogi. If so, the slavers may someday be quite surprised to realize that
 they are slaves themselves. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Grell</b></p>
<p align="left">Grell are vicious predators driven by their disturbing 
appetites. Unlike many of Eberron's other aberrations, these natives of 
Xoriat were not introduced by the daelkyr. Rather, they drifted into the
 world through the soft spaces that existed between the planes in the 
time before the Gatekeepers raised their seals. </p>
<p align="left">All of the material on grell in <i>Lords of Madness</i> can be used as is except one item: The grell of Eberron possesses damage reduction 5/byeshk.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tsochar</b></p>
<p align="left">The daelkyr are infamous for their use of symbionts and 
grafts, so it comes as no surprise that the shapers of flesh were also 
responsible for the tsochar -- parasitical creatures that can enslave or
 destroy the beings they inhabit. The tsochar are living weapons that 
the daelkyr release whenever they invade a world. Once freed, the 
creatures spread out to infiltrate the native species and steal the 
arcane knowledge of any creatures that might threaten the forces of 
Xoriat. </p>
<p align="left">The tsochar are deeply religious, but in Eberron, they 
give their devotion to the daelkyr and the powers of Xoriat rather than 
to Mak Thuum Ngatha. Tsochar are often associated with the Cults of the 
Dragon Below, and bonding with a tsochar is among the greatest honors to
 which a priest of such a cult can aspire -- even if it means his 
eventual death. A tsochar can be an excellent vector for introducing a 
cult into a new region -- the fiery street preacher who suddenly appears
 on the streets of Fairhaven could be a tsochar plant. </p>
<p align="left">Though they remain loyal servants of the lords of 
Xoriat, the tsochar consider themselves superior to all other daelkyr 
creations. Unless they are in a clear position of power, they prefer to 
avoid other aberrations altogether, In particular, a strong rivalry 
exists between the tsochar and the mind flayers because the former 
creatures envy the favored position of the illithids.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Aberration Hunter</b></p>
<p align="left">Chapter Nine of <i>Lords of Madness</i> provides options
 for creating player characters with a focus on aberrations -- both 
characters who hunt such creatures and those who have been tainted by 
their presence. A detailed discussion of all these options would 
constitute an article in its own right, but this new material is most 
relevant to three particular aspects of the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Ancient Defenders</b></p>
<p align="left">Prior to the Xoriat incursion, the dragon Vvaraak came 
to Khorvaire and taught a group of orcs certain rituals to defend the 
natural world from alien influences. Thus were born the Gatekeepers 
(described on page 241 of the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>). 
The Gatekeepers are the ones who eventually defeated the daelkyr and 
bound them in Khyber. Today, the few remaining Gatekeepers guard the 
ancient seals and hunt the twisted servants of Xoriat. </p>
<p align="left">The abolisher prestige class is a perfect match for the Gatekeeper order, and all of the general feats presented in <i>Lords of Madness</i>
 are highly appropriate for Gatekeeper rangers or druids. The keeper of 
the Cerulean Sign and the topaz guardian both share the goals of the 
Gatekeepers, but they use different techniques. Characters with these 
classes are more likely to be found among the people of the Seren 
Islands, who have also been taught by dragons. A dragon of the Chamber 
who expects to be dealing with aboleths may be able to call on keepers 
of the Cerulean Sign to aid her in battle. </p>
<p align="left">The darkrunner prestige class is suitable for 
Gatekeepers, but it is also appropriate for the dwarves of the Mror 
Holds. Many dwarves are interested in unearthing the history of the 
fallen kingdom, and some of the greatest heroes of the Mror clans are 
those who have fought aberrations in the depths below the Ironroot 
Mountains. </p>
<p align="left">The sanctified mind prestige class is most appropriate 
for a kalashtar character. Though it is well-suited to fighting the 
psionic powers of aberrations, it also represents an excellent match for
 the kalashtars' ongoing struggle with the Dreaming Dark. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Cults of the Dragon Below</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2007-04%20-%20Lords%20of%20Madness_files/ee_0605_fleshwarper.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="302" width="301">The
 Cults of the Dragon Below are the primary source of aberrant corruption
 in Eberron. The fleshwarper prestige class and the aberrant feats 
presented in <i>Lords of Madness</i> are all appropriate for cultists, 
as are the Hatred and Corruption domains. The fact that the cults are 
not unified in belief or structure can be reflected by making different 
domain choices available to members. Instead of allowing free access to 
all domains, the DM should choose three of the following for each cult: 
Corruption, Dragon Below, Earth, Evil, Hatred, or Madness. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Aberrant Blood</b></p>
<p align="left">The aberrant dragonmark described in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> can serve as an interesting tie to <i>Lords of Madness.</i>
 Such a mark typically appears when members of two different 
dragonmarked bloodlines have children. Although aberrant dragonmarks 
seem relatively harmless, providing weak powers that cannot be 
increased, a great deal of superstition surrounds them. In fact, stories
 say that they actually twist the bearer's body and mind. </p>
<p align="left">But what if these tales were true? If you use this 
variant, the Aberrant Dragonmark feat becomes an aberrant feat and can 
be substituted for Aberrant Blood to meet the prerequisites of any other
 aberrant feat. An aberrant dragonmark may not seem so bad, but when 
your character develops inhuman reach or inhuman vision, his companions 
may well start to worry.</p>
