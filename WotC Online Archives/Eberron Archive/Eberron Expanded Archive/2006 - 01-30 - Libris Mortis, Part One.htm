<p align="left">This installment of <i>Eberron Expanded</i> focuses on adapting the material from <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179240000"><i>Libris Mortis: The Book of Undead</i></a> for use in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign. From the Queen of the Dead to the skeletal armies of Karrnath, undead have always played a critical role in Eberron. <i>Libris Mortis </i>presents
 new information on the physiology and psychology of undead, plus a host
 of spells, feats, and prestige classes for both undead and those who 
battle them. This two-part article discusses ways to give this material 
an Eberron-specific twist.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Necromancers of the Modern Age</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-30%20-%20Libris%20Mortis,%20Part%20One_files/eb0130ee_eberronexp_vol.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="268" width="223">Outside
 of Karrnath, magic involving negative energy and the undead is often 
treated with suspicion. Few people care about minor necromantic spells 
such as <i>fear</i> and <i>ray of enfeeblement, </i>but a wizard with a 
zombie companion or an undead graft is likely to earn an unfriendly 
reaction in most of Khorvaire's nations. As a result, many of Eberron's 
greatest necromancers prefer to work in isolation. Some draw on the 
Shadow and the Keeper for inspiration, thereby further tainting the 
magic in the eyes of the public. Others approach the topic from an 
agnostic perspective, viewing necromantic magic as a way of channeling 
and shaping the negative energy that flows from the heart of Mabar.</p>
<p align="left">One organization that fully embraces necromancy is the 
Blood of Vol. Though currently out of favor with the Karrnathi throne, 
the Blood of Vol boasts many followers in both Karrnath and the Lhazaar 
Principalities, and it is the primary source of necromantic magic in 
present-day Eberron. But what magic is available to the followers of the
 Blood? Are the entire contents of <i>Libris Mortis</i> at the disposal of an agent of this organization? Did pale masters serve in the armies of Karrnarth?</p>
<p align="left">In a long-running campaign, the sudden introduction of a
 whole new set of spells raises many difficult questions. For example, 
why didn't Vol use encysting magic the last time anyone fought her? 
Furthermore, many of the options outlined in <i>Libris Mortis</i> could 
have a significant impact on the balance of power in the world. As 
dangerous as an army of Karrnathi skeletons is, one created by a 
necromancer with the Corpsecrafter and Destruction Retribution feats 
would be far worse. </p>
<p align="left">The decision to add material is always up to you as DM, 
but how you choose to accomplish the task can make the difference 
between endless questions and a seamless integration. In particular, 
elements from <i>Libris Mortis</i> can be much more interesting if they are added organically. Suppose Erandis d'Vol possesses a few of the secrets described in <i>Libris Mortis</i>
 that she shares with her inner circle, and that a few high-level 
members of the Blood of Vol have undead grafts or the ability to cast <i>blade of pain and fear</i>.
 But Karrnath doesn't yet have corpsecrafters or true necromancers. In 
such a model, a PC could be the first person in the modern age to master
 a spell from <i>Libris Mortis. </i>Alternatively, the introduction of 
much of this material could be a consequence of the party's failure in 
an adventure. For example, suppose the party stopped Vol from destroying
 the world but allowed her to escape with the <i>Qabalrin Codex.</i> The next time the party clashes with the Emerald Claw, her ghouls have new spells and levels of lurking terror. </p>
<p align="left">Limiting the spell knowledge of wizards is a simple 
task, but what about clerics? A cleric can normally cast any divine 
spell of a given level, so how does he "learn" new spells that are 
introduced? And what about Charisma-based arcane casters? What 
determines when a sorcerer is qualified to add <i>ghoul gauntlet</i> to his spell list? The possibilities are infinite, but the options outlined below are good places to start.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Even though a cleric need not have the same academic understanding 
of a spell as a wizard does, he must still comprehend its basic nature. 
Even divine spells have components, and knowledge of a verbal component 
is not automatic. The Song of the Keeper is a rare, holy text of the 
Dark Six that teaches clerics the words and gestures needed to cast <i>consumptive field.</i>
 Unlike a wizard, a cleric needs to read the book only once to learn the
 spells, but he does need the book to set him on the path.<br><br></li>
<li>The character may have to undergo some type of ritual before he is 
capable of casting a certain spell. Any cleric can ask the Shadow for <i>energy ebb, </i>but
 it will grant the spell only to a priest who has shed his blood on the 
basalt altar of Qalatesh. This concept works just as well for sorcerers 
as it does for clerics -- if a sorcerer wants to learn the spell, he 
must perform the required ritual sometime before he reaches the required
 level. The same process is also appropriate for feats. If you as DM 
want to allow a feat such as Necropotent in the game but need to explain
 why everyone doesn't have it, you can say that a PC has to drink the 
blood of a vampire before he can take it.<br><br></li>
<li>Mortals cannot ask for the spell -- it must be granted by a deity, 
powerful outsider, or ancient undead being. This model also lets you 
highlight the significance of a PC or a particularly important NPC -- 
the character may be the only person in the modern age who can cast a 
particular spell or take a special feat. </li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Ancient Masters of Necromancy</b></p>
<p align="left">So where does Erandis d'Vol go to learn new necromantic 
techniques? If she doesn't know the arts of the corpsecrafter, who does?
 Here are a few ideas with which you can build a rationale.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Khyber's Children</b></p>
<p align="left">The most terrifying powers in Eberron are the overlords 
of the Age of Demons: the first children of Khyber. Each of these 
spirits rivals the deities of other settings in sheer power -- and even 
while imprisoned, they can touch the world through dreams and the 
actions of their servants. </p>
<p align="left">The overlord Katashka possesses power over death. In the
 ancient battle against the dragons, Katashka raised a host of horrors, 
and those that survived the war are now the oldest undead creatures in 
existence. Katashka was imprisoned at the end of that conflict, but a 
number of his rakshasa servants still remain at large among the Lords of
 Dust. At the DM's discretion, these malefic spirits may have any of the
 new sorcerer/wizard spells presented in <i>Libris Mortis,</i> or 
possibly even levels in the pale master prestige class. A wizard can 
learn this magic by dealing with the rakshasas, but what price will he 
have to pay?</p>
<p align="left">Katashka is not truly a god, so he cannot grant spells. 
However, he can guide the thoughts of those who worship him and help 
them to draw dark magic from the heart of Khyber itself. Death cults 
have appeared throughout history -- the Dhakaani records speak of a sect
 of necromancers wiped out by a powerful emperor, and several stories of
 human death cults predate the rise of Galifar. </p>
<p align="left">Katashka's cultists gain access to the Deathbound, 
Undeath, and Evil domains. In addition, people born in the vicinity of 
his prison may be further touched by his darkness. It's up to you as DM 
to decide exactly where he is buried, but this concept forms a good 
basis for the Tomb-Tainted Soul feats. </p>
<p align="left">Any of the gods presented in <i>Libris Mortis</i> could 
be adapted as overlords of the first age, though that status represents a
 step down for most of them. Doresain would be an especially appropriate
 choice -- a party exploring a ruin from the Age of Demons could be 
surprised by zakyas with the powers of gravetouched ghouls! </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Qabalrin</b></p>
<p align="left">The first mortals to delve into the necromantic arts 
were some elves collectively known as the Qabalrin, who lived in 
isolation in Xen'drik. Legends claim that the Qabalrin learned the 
secrets of magic from the Shadow itself. Whether this tale is truth or 
hyperbole, the Qabalrin certainly possessed incredible skill. They are 
said to have created the first humanoid vampires, and a number of their 
greatest citizens reputedly became vampires -- only to be trapped and 
entombed after a feud that erupted between rival schools. The city of 
the Qabalrin was later destroyed by the fall of a massive dragonshard, 
an event that the giants claimed was the result of divine wrath. </p>
<p align="left">Some believe that the traditions of the line of Vol 
(which in turn formed the foundation of the Blood of Vol) were drawn 
from Qabalrin teachings. But even if that assertion is true, most of the
 Qabalrin's secrets remain hidden in the ruins of the Ring of Storms. 
Their greatest treasure, however, is the knowledge that remains in the 
minds of the ancient vampires who are still buried beneath the ruins of 
their once-great city. </p>
<p align="left">Virtually any sort of necromantic knowledge could be 
attributed to the Qabalrin. These elves certainly knew how to create 
undead grafts, and some of them probably became pale masters, masters of
 shrouds, and true necromancers. Rare spells might still be found in 
Qabalrin vaults, and knowledge recovered from their ruins could provide a
 character with access to feats such as Corpsecrafter or Necromantic 
Presence. </p>
<p align="left">On the other hand, the knowledge of the Qabalrin is as 
valuable to the undead as it is to the living. Thus, you could rule that
 certain monstrous feats can be gained only through the use of Qabalrin 
rituals. So if Erandis d'Vol wants to take Contagious Paralysis, she 
must first explore Xen'drik. Or perhaps the secrets of the master 
vampire prestige class are known only to the entombed lords of the 
Qabalrin. But these ancient vampires are creatures of epic power, and 
their release could have terrible consequences for Eberron.</p>
<p align="left">The clerics of the Qabalrin drew directly on the power 
of Mabar, though some chose to personify it through the lens of the 
Shadow. A cleric who recovers the texts of the Qabalrin and chooses to 
follow this path could gain access to the Deathbound, Evil, Magic, and 
Undeath domains. </p>
<p align="left">At your discretion, the followers of the Evening Glory 
could have been a subsect within the Qabalrin. In that model, the 
Evening Glory herself could have been one of the first Qabalrin 
vampires, whose motives were less malevolent than those of her comrades.
 While she would not possess divine rank and could not personally grant 
spells, she could still serve as a spiritual focus for a religion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Closed Circle</b></p>
<p align="left">The In the early days of Galifar, three wizards' circles
 took shape in the southern kingdom: the Esoteric Order of Aureon, the 
Guild of Starlight and Shadows, and the Closed Circle. The wizards of 
the Closed Circle specialized in transmutation, conjuration, and 
necromancy, and they sought to unlock the secrets of the daelkyr and the
 Qabalrin, as well as the power of the Dragon Below. In 641 YK, the 
Closed Circle was obliterated by the combined force of the Church of the
 Silver Flame and its two rival circles. But its workshops and 
mageholds, filled with dark and deadly secrets, may still be hidden 
across Breland or Darguun.</p>
<p align="left">Erandis d'Vol has thousands of years of tradition to 
draw upon. So how is it that the ruins of the Closed Circle -- an order 
that only lasted a few centuries -- can have anything to offer her? The 
fact that Erandis is drawing upon tradition can serve as an anchor when 
it comes to innovation. The humans of the Closed Circle were unorthodox 
and inventive, and their merging of daelkyr techniques with necromancy 
is an excellent explanation of phenomena such as the Mother Cyst feat 
and its related spells. So if you want to stage a race to keep the Blood
 of Vol from gaining new necromantic techniques, you don't have to send 
adventurers to Xen'drik -- the darkness could be hidden beneath Sharn, 
in the ruined fortress of the Closed Circle.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Vampires of the Blood of Vol</b></p>
<p align="left">The faith of the Blood of Vol is based on the idea that 
the undead are champions of the church. Worshipers willingly give their 
blood to vampires to strengthen them in battle. But according to <i>Libris Mortis,</i>
 the greatest force driving a vampire is its inescapable craving for 
life energy -- a hunger far more lethal to the victim than a little gift
 of blood. Such a system of sustenance represents a considerable 
sacrifice on the part of the faithful, and one that would quickly 
decimate Blood of Vol sects. Thus, vampires associated with the Blood of
 Vol should have a lesser craving for life energy. While they still 
require it to survive, the satiation period is 7 days, the Will DC save 
is 15, and the damage is reduced to 1d4 Wisdom. The simplest solution is
 to apply this adjustment to all vampires in the setting, but another 
strain of vampirism could exist if you wish. In that case, only undead 
whose roots can be traced back to the Qabalrin would have this lesser 
craving, while those created by Katashka would have an unquenchable 
thirst. </p>
<p align="left">In the next installment, we'll take a look at the 
Deathguard, Silver Flame adherents, and other characters who fight the 
undead, along with a general look at prestige classes, monsters, and 
other aspects of <i>Libris Mortis</i>!</p>
