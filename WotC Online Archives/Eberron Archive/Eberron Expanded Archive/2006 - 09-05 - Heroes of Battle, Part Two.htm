<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Prestige Classes</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Heroes of Battle </i>presents four new prestige 
classes. While these classes could be found anywhere in Eberron, there 
are a few cultures that are especially well-suited to these classes. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat Medic.</b> During the Last War, Thrane had the
 largest force of characters with levels in the combat medic PrC. Aside 
from its strong reliance on divine magic to bolster its troops, the 
ministry of the Silver Flame fights evil by merciful acts, and many 
members of the ministry are trained in the healing arts. In the armies 
of other nations, combat medics are usually agents of House Jorasco. The
 House of Healing maintains a corps of healers and combat medics, and 
many nations rely on these mercenary agents of mercy. Other combat 
medics are usually devotees of Boldrei, Olladra, or the Silver Flame. 
Even during the Last War, followers of the Flame were found throughout 
the Five Nations; many placed national loyalty before allegiance to 
Flamekeep.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dread Commando. </b>These soldiers can be found in 
any army, but the best known commando units are those of the Valenar 
elves and goblinoids of Darguun. Dread commandos are trained to be 
stealthy even while armored, making them excellent shock troops. Stealth
 is one of the primary weapons of the Valenar; while the elves are known
 for their terrifying cavalry charges, a small warband will often use 
guerilla tactics to defeat an enemy, striking with patience and 
precision. Valenar commandos usually begin as rangers or scouts. </p>
<p align="left">In Darguun, all of the different races have their own 
dread commando traditions. Among the Dhakaani goblins, the taarka'khesh 
rangers frequently take two levels of dread commando to offset the 
penalties of armor. Goblin legends say that the Dhakaani emperor 
maintained a squad of elite warriors known as the Kech Nasaar, "Keepers 
of Night." The Kech Nasaar heroes possessed four or more levels of dread
 commando and wore full plate enchanted with the <i>shadow </i>and <i>silent moves </i>properties.
 They have not been seen since the fall of the empire, but some goblins 
say that the Kech Nasaar are watching in the shadows, waiting to stake 
their claim to the new throne.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-05%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Battle,%20Part%20Two_files/eb20050905a_legendaryleader.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="403" width="210"><b>Legendary Leader. </b>Aundair
 has more war wizards than any other nation, Thrane has more paladins, 
clerics, and adepts than its neighbors, and Karrnath supplements its 
military might with necromancy. Breland relies on the skill and courage 
of its leaders to overcome these obstacles. Karrnath may be home to the 
Rekkenmark Academy, but many of the most innovative commanders of the 
war emerged from Breland, and their charisma and cunning often enabled 
their armies to victory against seemingly superior foes. While many of 
these heroes were slain over the course of the last century, Breland is 
still a land of legends. A DM using <i>Heroes of Battle</i> may want to 
modify the class levels of notable Brelish leaders to include a few 
levels in this PrC. Thus you could end up with King Boranel (CG male 
human aristocrat 2/fighter 5/legendary leader 3) or Handan Dol (LN male 
dwarf fighter 5/warrior 6/legendary leader 5). Handan Dol is the 
commander of the Redcloak Battalion in <i>Sharn, City of Towers</i>.</p>
<p align="left">While Breland is renowned for its legendary leaders, 
every nation has its heroes. Next to Breland, Valenar is probably the 
most likely place to find members of this class, but all of the armies 
of the Five Nations had a legendary leader or two -- though many fell in
 battle. </p>
<p align="left"><b>War Weaver. </b>The mystical tradition of the war 
weaver can be traced back to the elves of Aerenal. The Aereni know as 
much about life as they do about death, and they were the first to 
discover the technique of weaving threads of life together to benefit 
from a single spell. The Arcane Congress devoted considerable effort to 
replicating this technique, but it took the Last War to produce the 
breakthrough that brought war weaving to Aundair. By now, the other 
nations may have duplicated the techniques the Aundairians have been 
using against them. Or perhaps this task will fall to a party of 
adventurers: finding a way to steal the secrets of war weaving on behalf
 of Breland or Karrnath!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fun with Warriors</b></p>
<p align="left">While prestige classes are well and good, one of the principles of the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>
 is that most NPCs use NPC classes, and are relatively low level. As a 
result, the armies of Khorvaire shouldn't be brimming with dread 
commandos, and legendary leaders really should be legendary. However, <i>Heroes of Battle</i> introduces a few feats that can add color to armies comprised primarily of warriors. </p>
<p align="left">Guerilla Warrior and Guerilla Scout are excellent feats 
for creating a more versatile squad of warriors. These feats are 
especially appropriate for characters from the Eldeen Reaches, Shadow 
Marches, or Talenta Plains. You don't want to make the halfling a full 
rogue, but you want him to be sneakier than his Brelish counterparts? 
Make him a warrior with the Guerilla Warrior feat, wearing light armor 
and with maximum ranks in Hide and Move Silently. </p>
<p align="left">Shield Wall and Coordinated Shot are ways to make masses
 of warriors more of a challenge for higher level opponents. Archers 
with the Ready Shot feat can also prove an unpleasant surprise to the 
half-orc barbarian used to charging his foes! </p>
<p align="left"><b>Choosing a War</b></p>
<p align="left">So: you've decided to run a military adventure in 
Eberron. But where? And when? War has shaped the history of Eberron, and
 there are a host of battles to choose from. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Last War</b></p>
<p align="left">The conflict that has the greatest impact on the lives 
of most of the people of modern Khorvaire is the civil war that 
shattered the nation of Galifar, a century-long campaign optimistically 
known as the Last War. </p>
<p align="left">When generating a campaign around the Last War, it is 
important to establish the goals. Are you exploring the very beginning 
of the war? Or the end? Is this a campaign of its own, or is it the 
prologue to an adventure set in the postwar era?</p>
<p align="left">Building a war campaign as a bridge leading into a more 
traditional series of adventures set after the war is an excellent tool 
for bringing characters together and establishing them as adventurers in
 the modern age. After a few missions on the battlefield, adventurers 
can emerge as 3rd or 4th-level characters -- ready to tackle more 
powerful dungeons or challenges in the world beyond the war. The 
experience can also provide them with important connections to NPCs. An 
old war buddy might need a helping hand. A former commander could hire 
the party for dangerous work based on her knowledge of their skills. An 
enemy soldier could be met in the neutral ground of an inn -- do the 
characters still hold a grudge? Even their actions in the war could form
 the basis for future adventures. In one of their early missions, the 
heroes must help secure a stockpile of gold in the vaults of Metrol. 
After the Mourning, they are among the only people who know the location
 of the vault -- can they lead an expedition into the Mournland to 
recover the gold? And what if it's already been seized by the Lord of 
Blades? </p>
<p align="left">A full history of the Last War is sadly beyond the scope of this article. A few of the major battles are mentions in the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i> and <i>The Five Nations</i>,
 and others will be described over the course of time. For now, look at 
the map, choose your battlefields and combatants, and build from there. 
All of the nations fought each other at one point or another, and each 
nation had its own flavor on the field of battle. While all of the Five 
Nations used magic, Aundair made the greatest use of arcane magic, while
 Thrane had strong divine support from the Church of the Silver Flame. 
Karrnath combined grim discipline with the power of necromancy. Cyre 
made extensive use of mercenaries in the early stages of the war, and 
used the greatest number of warforged troops towards the end of it. And 
Breland relied on its clever generals and industrial capability, 
outmatching its enemies' abilities in the production of siege engines 
and other mundane tools of war. Chapter Two and Chapter Three of <i>Heroes of Battle</i>
 presents a host of ideas for adventures and battlefield encounters. 
Choose your sides, and make sure that the forces involved reflect the 
nature of each nation involved; between the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting </i>book and <i>Heroes of Battle</i>, you should have all the tools you need. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Lycanthropic Purge</b></p>
<p align="left">In 832 YK, the Church of the Silver Flame responded to 
the pleas of the people of Western Aundair and Breland. These regions 
were under attack by waves of shapeshifters -- packs of savage 
werewolves and cunning wererats, who were carving a swath of death and 
infection across western Khorvaire. This was the beginning of the 
Lycanthropic Purge, which started as a war against these vicious killers
 but ultimately resulted in the virtual extinction of all lycanthropes. </p>
<p align="left">The Lycanthropic Purge can be an interesting backdrop 
for adventure, regardless of which side the party chooses to explore. In
 the early stage of the conflict, players could assume the roles of 
Silver Flame templars protecting an Aundairian village against an 
anticipated onslaught: but will the lycanthropes rely on brute force, or
 seek to infiltrate and infect from within? A higher level party could 
lead a force against a shapeshifter stronghold deep in the Eldeen 
Reaches, fighting both lycanthropes and the beasts they control through 
their empathic abilities. Alternately, players could assume the role of 
shifters or noble lycanthropes caught in a region under siege by Silver 
Puritans. Can they find a way to break through the enemy lines and lead 
any innocents to the gates of Lamannia? </p>
<p align="left">For the most part, the Purge is a struggle between the 
discipline and divine magic of the Silver Flame and the raw power of the
 lycanthropes. The shapeshifters' ability to hide among humanity and to 
swell their ranks through infection adds to the challenge of the 
battles. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Battles of the Future</b></p>
<p align="left">No one won the Last War. The conflict was brought to an 
abrupt halt by the terrible destruction of the Mourning. The nature of 
the Mourning remains a mystery, and for the moment no nation dares to 
fully return to the field of battle until the threat of the Mourning has
 been laid to rest. </p>
<p align="left">But tensions remain -- and the war is not truly over. 
The Valenar elves still battle the Darguuls in the Mournland, and cross 
blades with the Karrns in the Talenta Plains. The lords of Aundair eye 
the Eldeen Reaches with covetous eyes. The survivors of Cyre seek a new 
land to replace their lost kingdom. The Thranes still despise the 
Karrns, and the feeling is mutual. </p>
<p align="left">These struggles could be a temporary distraction from 
the normal events of a campaign, or they could be the focus of it. 
Perhaps the party are members of a Valenar warband, and they are 
traveling the east in search of glory for their ancestors, joining in 
any battle they can find. Maybe they are Karrns stationed at Fort Bones,
 fighting elf and halfling raiders while dealing with the internal 
conflicts between the soldiers loyal to King Kaius and those who favor 
the Emerald Claw. Perhaps they are Dhakaani goblins, engaged in 
full-scale wars with the other Kech clans to determine the future of the
 empire. Or maybe the Treaty of Thronehold finally breaks and the heroes
 must take sides as the remnants of the Five Nations return to the war 
for the Kingdom of Galifar. </p>
<p align="left">The advantage of these modern-day conflicts is that 
players don't know the outcome. In a campaign based in the Last War, the
 players know that it will eventually come to an end with the Treaty of 
Thronehold. If the battles begin again, the outcome is a mystery. Will 
one nation finally seize regain control of the old kingdom? Or will the 
Mourning come again? Are these the final days of Eberron? </p>
<p align="left">This ideas are just the beginning. Adventurers could 
explore the ancient war between dragons and rakshasa, or the elven 
rebellion against the giants. They could take the role of the orcish 
Gatekeepers fighting against the horrors of Xoriat, or the dragonmarked 
houses battling the aberrant forces of Lord Halas Tarkanan during the 
War of the Mark. Conflict is part of the foundation of Eberron -- and <i>Heroes of Battle </i>gives you everything you need to set these adventures in motion! </p>
