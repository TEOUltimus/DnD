<p><i>Welcome back to Eberron Expanded. This series of articles examines sourcebooks that have not been specifically designed for the </i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting<i>. Bear in mind that the ideas presented in these articles are </i>suggestions<i>. As a DM, you always have the final word as to what you add to your game and how you want it to fit into the world.</i></p>
<p>The <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953670000">Complete Psionic</a></i> sourcebook<i></i>presents
 a host of new options for players and DMs: feats, equipment, races, 
monsters, and both basic and prestige classes. Let's examine ways to 
incorporate these elements into the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>. For additional information about the role of psionics in the world, refer to the <i>Psionics in Eberron </i>Dragonshard article.</p>
<p><b>The Exiles of Talaron</b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2010-23%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/eb20061023_psionic1.jpg" border="0" align="right"><i>Complete Psionic </i>introduces
 two forces -- the Hidden Houses and the guild of the Diamond Knights --
 that trace their history back to the fallen world of Talaron. A DM who 
wishes to uses these organizations in the game has to decide the nature 
of Talaron. The <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting </i>says that the 
daelkyr of Xoriat consider the destruction of worlds to be a form of art
 . . . a statement that implies that they have destroyed worlds in the 
past. Thus, one possibility is that the exiles of Talaron are the last 
survivors of a world shattered by the Realm of Madness. Following this 
path, the Diamond Knights would be the mortal foes of the Cults of the 
Dragon Below and natural allies of the Gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Talaron was a city, not a world -- a vast
 metropolis in the Sarlonan kingdom of Rhiavhaar. The noble houses of 
Talaron were known for their psychic powers and vivid dreams. For ages 
these psionic abilities helped them maintain their influence in society,
 but when the Dreaming Dark turned its eyes to Sarlona, those same 
powers were turned against the houses. Many heirs proved to be 
particularly vulnerable to quori manipulation, and these formed the 
first rank of quori agents in Eberron: the force that would one day 
become the Inspired. Those who could resist the Dreaming Dark were 
hunted down by their corrupted brethren and fled to Khorvaire amid the 
other refugees. This is why the houses hide; they still fear the 
persecution of the Dreaming Dark and their corrupted brethren. Today, 
they fight their own secret war against the Dreaming Dark and Dal Quor. 
Occasionally, the Diamond Knights ally with kalashtar atavists, but many
 of the children of Talaron distrust anything touched by Dal Quor; in 
the minds of these zealots, the kalashtar are just as bad as the 
Inspired, and the hidden houses have struck against the kalashtar in the
 past.</p>
<p>Regardless of which path the DM chooses to take, the inland Lhazaar 
Principalities are an excellent place to put the Hidden Houses, the 
Diamond Knights, and the other exiles of Talaron. The Lhazaar 
Principalities are best known for sailors and pirates, but there are 
inland principalities between the Lhazaar Sea and the Ironroot 
Mountains, and these regions are often overlooked by the people of the 
Five Nations. Every principality has its own traditions and customs, 
some dating back to Old Sarlona. This is an easy place for the Hidden 
Houses of Talaron to hide from prying eyes. It's quite possible that 
each house has a principality to call its own, although the prince and 
his people would conceal their powers from travelers.</p>
<p><b>Illithid Heritage </b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2010-23%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/eb20061023_psionic2.jpg" border="0" align="right">In the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting,</i>
 mind flayers are emissaries of Xoriat, the Realm of Madness. However, 
their origins remain a mystery. Are they the spawn of Xoriat itself? Or 
are they the twisted survivors of another world?</p>
<p>Regardless of the answer, the illithids are iconic symbols of Xoriat 
and the Cults of the Dragon Below. The illithid heritage feats presented
 in <i>Complete Psionic </i>could be caused by many things besides actual illithid ancestry:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ancient blade forged by Dyrrn the Corruptor taints all who come 
into contact with it. Anyone who carries the blade suffers a slow 
transformation. Over the course of weeks, the character's feats are 
replaced by illithid heritage feats. When he acquires four such feats, 
he becomes a true illithid in mind and body, turning on his former 
allies. This corruption can be reversed if the wielder can be separated 
from the blade, but the immense ego of the artifact prevents a 
weak-willed host from relinquishing this treasure.<br><br></li>
<li>A manifest zone linked to Xoriat corrupts all who linger in its 
confines for an extended period of time. A century ago, a village was 
built within the zone; now illithid heritage feats can be found 
throughout the population of the village, although the people here 
typically hide these &amp;quot;blessings&amp;quot; from outsiders. What 
happens when adventurers stumble into this haven of the Cults of the 
Dragon Below? What if one of the adventurers was born in this village 
and is only now discovering the taint within her bloodline?<br><br></li>
<li>Darguul legends speak of the Kech Uul. Reports said that this 
Dhakaani clan was completely eradicated in battle with the daelkyr. But 
some say that the Kech Uul were not destroyed -- rather, they were 
infected by the horrors that they fought and chose to go into hiding 
instead of revealing their shame. If the Kech Uul still exist, do these 
illithid-touched goblinoids fight the forces of Xoriat? Or have they 
fallen prey to the power of madness and turned against their kin?<br><br></li>
<li>Any cleric, adept, or favored soul dedicated to the Cults of the 
Dragon Below could easily develop illithid heritage feats -- a terrible 
sign of the power of his faith.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Synads and Host Feats </b></p>
<p>The synad race has much in common with the kalashtar of Eberron. Both
 trace their roots to another plane of existence -- in both cases a 
realm full of horrors. And both races are defined by their expanded 
minds; the threefold mind in the case of the synad, and the quori-human 
union of the kalashtar.</p>
<p>Because there is such overlap between the two races, a DM may wish to
 focus on just one of these races. If a DM likes the kalashtar storyline
 but prefers the racial traits of the synad, one option is to simply 
change the names by using synad traits for the kalashtar. Say that the 
oracle aspect of the synad's threefold mind is actually the influence of
 the quori spirit. Another option is to say that synads and kalashtar 
are actually offshoots with the same point of origin -- that synads are 
bound to a previously unknown class of quori spirit that has a different
 relationship with its hosts. Both of these have the advantage of 
letting the synad draw on the existing story built around the kalashtar,
 including a homeland in Adar and the ongoing struggle with the Dreaming
 Dark.</p>
<p>A completely different approach is to make the synads an entirely 
artificial race. House Vadalis is best known for its magebred animals. 
But long-lived rumors say that Vadalis magebreeders have been 
experimenting on humans. The synads could be the result of House Vadalis
 attempting to create its own kalashtar. A DM who follows this path 
needs to decide how many synads exist in the world, and whether they are
 loyal to their creators. Is there a growing corps of synads hidden 
within House Vadalis? Or are there only a handful of synads: fugitives 
fleeing from a house that wants to erase all evidence of the breeding 
program?</p>
<p>In either case, the host feats presented in <i>Complete Psionic </i>are
 suitable for both Inspired and kalashtar. However, in the case of the 
Inspired, the empty vessel cannot take advantage of these feats while 
its quori spirit is absent.</p>
<p><b>New Classes: Ardent, Divine Mind, and Lurk</b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2010-23%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/eb20061023_psionic3.jpg" border="0" align="right"><i>Complete Psionic </i>presents
 three new psionic classes. While a character of any race or culture 
could pursue one of these paths, each class is best suited to a 
particular aspect of Eberron.</p>
<p>While the kalashtar brought considerable knowledge of the psionic 
arts with them when they first arrived on Eberron, some humans had 
studied the powers of the mind long before this time. The path of the <b>ardent</b>
 has a long history in Adar, one that stands apart from the Path of 
Light. Both kalashtar and Inspired may become ardents, but the greatest 
students of the ardent philosophies are humans. If the DM chooses to 
trace the history of the Six Hidden Houses back to pre-Riedran Sarlona, 
the ardent could have a strong place within this hidden psionic culture.</p>
<p>Many roles await the <b>divine mind </b>in Eberron. <i>Complete Psionic </i>provides
 mantle lists for all of the major religions of Eberron. Divine minds 
are rarely seen within the churches of the Five Nations, but faith can 
always bring out latent talent. The Cult of the Dragon Below has 
produced a number of divine minds, fearsome warriors armored in the 
essence of madness, but the majority of divine minds hail from Sarlona. 
Among the priests of the Path of Light, divine minds are considerably 
more common than clerics or adepts. On the other side of the coin, the 
Inspired worship the Dreaming Dark itself; this provides them with 
access to the Evil, Law, Light and Darkness, and Corruption and Madness 
mantles. The Corruption and Madness mantle represents the terrors held 
within the Dreaming Dark, and the manifestations of its powers should 
reflect this bond to nightmares.</p>
<p>The <b>lurk </b>is a scoundrel who uses psionic power to enhance her 
gifts of stealth and deception. The Dreaming Dark is a common source for
 lurks, both actual Inspired agents and humans trained in Khorvaire to 
serve the ends of il-Lashtavar. However, there is another strong lurk 
tradition. Doppelgangers are naturally telepathic, and the secret 
society known as the Cabinet of Faces often trains both doppelgangers 
and changelings in the lurking arts. The lurks of the Dreaming Dark 
often learn combat-oriented powers, to better serve as assassins. The 
traditions of the Cabinet of Faces emphasize stealth and evasion, aimed 
to serve the spy as opposed to the killer.</p>
<p>While a few kalashtar follow the path of the lurk, most prefer the 
contemplative paths of the psion or divine mind. Rumors of a radical 
group of kalashtar lurk-soulknives known as the Blades of Taratai have 
been floating around, and some say the members of this group engage in 
aggressive acts against the Inspired deep in the heart of Riedra. If 
this group exists, it is well hidden. The elders of Adar maintain that 
most Riedrans and even empty vessels are innocent victims of the 
Dreaming Dark; as such, they disapprove of many of the actions 
attributed to the Blades.</p>
<p><b>Prestige Classes </b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2010-23%20-%20Complete%20Psionic_files/eb20061023_psionic4.jpg" border="0" align="right"><i>Complete Psionic</i> presents eight psionic prestige classes; here are possible hooks for each of them.</p>
<p><b>Anarchic Initiate. </b>While many believe that psionic power flows
 from Dal Quor and Xoriat, the anarchic initiate draws her wild energy 
from the plane of Kythri, the Churning Chaos. All effects that refer to 
Limbo should be altered to Kythri. Changelings are often drawn to this 
path, and anarchic initiates occasionally work with the Cabinet of 
Faces, though most initiates are too chaotic to align with any one 
organization for long, even one aligned with the Traveler.</p>
<p><b>Ebon Saint. </b>The Cabinet of Faces claims that the Traveler 
taught doppelgangers the arts of the ebon saint before humanity even 
came to Khorvaire. Ebon saints are widely respected among doppelgangers,
 regardless of race. The motivations of the Cabinet of Faces remain a 
mystery. Sometimes a saint of the Traveler sells his services, but often
 he simply shows up with a piece of invaluable information and vanishes 
again, with no explanation. Of course, one should always beware the 
gifts of the Traveler; the &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; of an ebon saint may
 have unforeseen consequences.</p>
<p>An adventurer who wishes to become an ebon saint must first find an 
instructor, and this can be a considerable challenge. A doppelganger 
saint is more likely to mentor a changeling than a member of any of the 
other common races, but the only predictable thing about the Cabinet of 
Faces is that it is unpredictable.</p>
<p>At the DM's discretion, when a character that already possesses the 
ability to change shape at will (such as a doppelganger, changeling, or 
rakshasa) uses the <i>steal form </i>ability of the ebon saint, he should receive a +5 insight bonus on his Disguise check.</p>
<p><b>Ectopic Adept.</b> The Quori are shapers of dreams, and the skills
 of the ectopic adept make dreams into deadly reality. For the kalashtar
 of Adar, long outnumbered by their Riedran foes, the arts of the shaper
 are a vital tool in the defense of the nation. Both Adarans and 
Inspired have orders of ectopic adepts; the finest school in Eberron is 
known as the Pillar of Tanalash, located in the Adaran fortress of 
Malshashar.</p>
<p><b>Flayerspawn Psychics.</b> Any of the options explored in the Illithid Heritage section above could apply to flayerspawn psychics.</p>
<p><b>Illumine Souls. </b>Tales of the war between the Undying Court and
 the Line of Vol mention three champions who wielded the pure light of 
Irian, &amp;quot;smiting the enemy with sunlight blades.&amp;quot; While
 other psionic classes are rare in Aerenal, the Deathguard maintains an 
elite cadre of soulknives known as the Iria Tairn, or the 
&amp;quot;warriors of light.&amp;quot; Few in number, these illumine 
souls are held in reserve for the most terrible dangers. Any elf or 
half-elf soulknife sworn to the Undying Court could seek to join this 
order. To date, no member of any other race has been inducted into the 
Iria Tairn, but a hero who proves the purity of his intentions might win
 the trust of the Deathguard.</p>
<p><b>Soulbows.</b> The soulbow tradition has its roots among the 
dromites of Sarlona, and Riedrans have frequently faced dromite 
mind-archers in the intermittent wars between the two nations. The 
technique has been adopted by both the Inspired and the people of Adar, 
and the Reclaimers easily could be found on the fringes of Riedra.</p>
<p><b>Storm Disciples. </b>Adar is a land of strange and violent 
weather, of storms that often seem to protect the realm from those who 
mean it harm. Legends attribute this to the power of the Storm 
Guardians, a clan of blue dragons who dwell on the peak of Korrandar. 
The storm disciples are a monastic order founded long before the coming 
of the kalashtar, and they consider themselves to be the true guardians 
of Adar. While they may fight side by side against the Riedrans, there 
has been tension between the storm disciples and the kalashtar; the 
disciples believe that the current woes of Adar can be laid at the feet 
of the kalashtar, and some say that the refuge of Adar was never meant 
for the spirits of another world.</p>
<p>In addition to the disciples of Adar, there are rumors that an 
enclave of House Lyrandar is exploring new ways to manipulate the power 
of the storm. Is this a natural gift? Or is this knowledge offered by 
agents of the Dreaming Dark, a lure to corrupt young heirs of the house 
into serving the quori agenda?</p>
<p><b>Zerth Cenobites. </b>The most common practitioners of zerthin on 
Eberron are the dolgaunt monks of Khyber. Though blind, these dolgaunt 
mystics can see through time and slip through the seconds to catch foes 
unawares. Some say that these techniques were stolen from another world 
destroyed by the daelkyr; an obscure dolgaunt legend says that the first
 Zerthin masters threw themselves forward in time to escape death, and 
warns that this githzerai army could reemerge at any moment to seek 
vengeance for their shattered world.</p>
