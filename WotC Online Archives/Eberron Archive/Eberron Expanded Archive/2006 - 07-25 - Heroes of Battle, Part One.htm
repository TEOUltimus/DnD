<p align="left">This installment of Keith Baker's new <i>Eberron Expanded</i> column focuses on adapting material from <i>Heroes of Battle</i> for use in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Overview: Armed Conflict in Eberron</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2007-25%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Battle,%20Part%20One_files/ebee20050725a_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="297" width="320"><i>A
 Valenar warband crests the hill. A shiver runs through your 
comrades-at-arms when they recognize the banner of Caelys Drynn, the 
cavalry commander who led the charge at the Redoak Bridge. The sound of 
singing drifts down the slope as the enemy troops, who obviously adore 
their leader, begin to sing the praises of Drynn and his ancestors. Then
 a flight of arrows fills the air, and the elves begin the charge.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>As the rain of missiles fills the sky, you feel the 
touch of magic, and the shafts scatter and split. Your commander, Jila 
ir'Catar, calls on the war wizards to hold their ground. Jila has never 
lost a battle, and her reputation gives you confidence. Now the first 
wave of cavalry draws near, and you prepare to shield the nearest wizard
 with your body if need be. Right now, his magic is worth far more than 
your steel.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Heroes of Battle</i> introduces a variety of optional
 rules systems that can help you bring war stories such as the one above
 to a fantasy world. Using these guidelines, a commander can hone his 
talents to perfect a certain style of combat, and small military units 
-- such as parties of adventurers -- can learn special techniques that 
provide invaluable benefits in battle. In addition, the book contains 
rules for siege engines, morale, aerial bombardment, and more. All in 
all, the various systems described in <i>Heroes of Battle</i> help to differentiate the forces of various nations and add color to combat. </p>
<p align="left">The narration above describes the moment when the great 
cavalry commander Caelys Drynn (N male elf fighter 6/legendary leader 4)
 joins battle with the troops of Jila ir'Catar of Aundair (LN female 
human wizard 5/war weaver 5). Drynn's deeds are an inspiration to his 
troops, and his image is further bolstered by his elf commander aura (<i>Heroes of Battle,</i> page 76) and his levels in the legendary leader prestige class (<i>Heroes of Battle, </i>page 108). Drynn also has the Mounted Mobility feat (<i>Heroes of Battle,</i> page 98) and has trained his personal warband in the heavy cavalry teamwork technique (<i>Heroes of Battle,</i> page 117). These advantages have allowed him to overrun many foes.</p>
<p align="left">But the Valenar commander may have met his match in Jila
 ir'Catar. Her war weaving ability lets her spread her spells across 
multiple units, her spellslinging commander aura enhances the firepower 
of her wizards, and her spellcaster guardian teamwork benefit helps her 
soldiers shield the weaker wizards. Jila may not be a legendary leader, 
but her Inspirational Leadership feat helps her troops maintain their 
morale in the face of danger. </p>
<p align="left">Caelys Drynn and Jila ir'Catar are just two examples of characters that can be created using the new rules in <i>Heroes of Battle.</i> Little adaptation is required to use this book in an <b>Eberron</b>
 campaign, since using the material presented is largely a matter of 
common sense. A Karrn captain is more likely to be a necromantic 
commander than a deathslayer commander, and a House Vadalis beast squad 
might have an animal commander or a feral commander. </p>
<p align="left">In this article and the next one, we will examine ways to adapt specific material from <i>Heroes of Battle</i> to the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting.</i> We'll also consider some possible scenarios for military campaigns in the world of Eberron. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Battle Magic </b></p>
<p align="left">Arcane magic has been part of daily life in Khorvaire 
for many an age. Thus, it's reasonable to assume that during a century 
of warfare, the various nations would devise deadly spells and other 
tools of war. Nearly all the spells and items presented in <i>Heroes of Battle</i>
 have logical places in Eberron, but you as Dungeon Master must decide 
whether this magic is available to all characters, or whether its 
secrets are known only to a few nations. The latter approach provides 
interesting plot options for espionage-oriented campaigns. For example, 
perhaps the Arcane Congress of Aundair wants to unlock the secret of the
 <i>animate legion</i> spell, but the only way to do so is to send spies into the great temple of Atur! Are your PCs up to the task?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Kinds of Magic</b></p>
<p align="left">The various spellcasting classes all have their own 
approaches to battle magic, and a different in-game logic may apply to 
each. The following sections describe how to best utilize the material 
presented in <i>Heroes of Battle</i> with each kind of magic in an <b>Eberron</b> campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Druids and Rangers</b></p>
<p align="left">War is an integral part of the history of Eberron's 
druids. They were in the thick of the fight during the ancient battle 
between the Gatekeepers and the daelkyr, and in more modern times, they 
helped the people of western Aundair secede and join the Eldeen Reaches.
 The Wardens of the Wood may not possess much in the way of siege 
equipment, but a few highly mobile units with <i>hurtling stone</i> at their disposal could devastate larger massed forces or slow massive siege engines.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bards</b></p>
<p align="left">Although the Dhakaani goblinoids have begun to 
experiment with the tradition of wizardry, bards have always formed the 
backbone of the goblinoid magical tradition. The Valenar elves also 
commonly incorporate bards into their warbands to inspire troops with 
tales of their heroic ancestors. Because war is so deeply engrained in 
these two cultures, both hobgoblin and elf bards would logically have 
access to the military magic presented in <i>Heroes of Battle.</i> It's 
up to you as DM to decide whether other cultures can also make use of 
these spells, or whether a Brelish bard would have to travel with the 
Valenar to master their <i>drums of war</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Clerics and Paladins</b></p>
<p align="left">Technically, clerics can use any spells on the clerical 
spell list. For the purpose of campaign flavor, however, you may want to
 restrict certain spells to particular religions, thus placing them 
between domain spells and general spells in terms of availability. In 
this latter arrangement, <i>animate legion</i> and <i>desecrate battlefield</i> might be tied to the Blood of Vol, and <i>spiritual cavalry</i>
 might be limited to the Valenar, the Talenta halflings (who would use 
it to create dinosaur riders), or a dedicated priest of Dol Arrah. In 
like manner, <i>early twilight</i> could be a tool of the Shadow, the 
Blood of Vol, and the Dragon Below. Limiting the availability of divine 
battlefield spells in this manner can help to create distinct identities
 and battle strategies for the different armies. For example, anyone who
 battles Cults of the Dragon Below can expect enemy clerics to blot out 
the sun, but the Church of the Silver Flame would instead illuminate the
 sky so that its troops can continue the battle deep into the night. </p>
<p align="left">Introducing new divine spells into a campaign is always 
tricky for the DM. After all, you're effectively saying, "Hey! There's 
this new spell that you've always been able to cast and which would have
 been useful in last night's game, but you've never bothered to prepare 
it so far!" To help bolster the thin logic of such situations, consider 
ruling that these spells are lost techniques that the characters must 
recover before they can use them. If only the Shulassakar know the 
secrets of drawing <i>consecrate battlefield</i> and <i>battlefield illumination</i>
 from the Silver Flame, a cleric who wants to cast these spells must 
first find a Shulassakar mentor. The same kind of logic applies to 
introducing bard and druid spells as well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wizards and Sorcerers</b></p>
<p align="left">All the spells on the sorcerer/wizard list in <i>Heroes of Battle</i>
 are useful in mass combat, and all are logical developments of the Last
 War. The only question is whether any of them are used only by specific
 nations. As with limiting divine spells by religion, such an 
arrangement can lead to interesting adventure possibilities and add 
color to a campaign. For example, if only the Aundairian wizards have 
developed <i>shrieking blast,</i> characters can recognize their foe as soon as they hear the screams on the border. </p>
<p align="left">My personal suggestions are to restrict both <i>animate legion</i> and <i>early twilight</i> to Karrnath, and to limit <i>battlemagic perception</i> and <i>shrieking blast</i> to Aundair. After all, arcane magic is a mainstay of the armies of Aundair, and <i>battlemagic perception</i>
 can help their countermages maintain this strategic advantage. The rest
 of the spells can be accessible to all arcane spellcasters in the Five 
Nations. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Dragonmarks</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Leomund's billet</i> and <i>aerial alarm</i> are 
excellent matches for the portfolios of the Mark of Hospitality and the 
Mark of Warding, respectively. Each house should certainly have 
dragonmarked foci that allow its heirs to produce these effects. If you 
as DM want to take this concept to extremes, you could restrict <i>Leomund's billet</i>
 to spellcasters who possess the Mark of Hospitality. Though it's not an
 actual dragonmarked power, a wizard, sorcerer, or bard would need to 
have the mark in order to cast the spell. Such an arrangement would 
provide the House of Hospitality with an important battlefield function,
 and nations would surely pay good gold for a halfling quartermaster who
 could produce instant shelter for her troops. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Magic Items</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2007-25%20-%20Heroes%20of%20Battle,%20Part%20One_files/ebee20050725a_med2.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="340" width="237">The magic items presented in Chapter Six of <i>Heroes of Battle</i>
 are all well suited to an Eberron campaign and can be used as templates
 for creating other magic weapons of war. The gnomes of Zilargo were 
probably the primary producers of alchemist's stone ammunition and <i>elemental rockshot, </i>but
 House Cannith could have manufactured magic siege engines and sold them
 to any nation. Disrupting siege engines played a critical role in 
Thrane's struggle, while the Order of the Emerald Claw provided Karrnath
 with <i>necromantic siege engines</i> and <i>banners of the unliving. Blast disks</i> were employed by many of the nations, especially Aundair. In fact, many battlefields still contain unexploded <i>blast disks</i>
 -- a fact that makes the exploration of the past a very dangerous 
thing. And while House Jorasco healers couldn't be everywhere at once, 
the house made a tidy sum on the sales of <i>blessed bandages</i> -- an item to which many old soldiers owe their lives.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Military Honors </b></p>
<p align="left">In any military force, merit is generally recognized 
through advancement in rank and by the awarding of decorations. This 
section details the ranks and decorations available in the armies of the
 Five Nations.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ranks</b></p>
<p align="left">Rank plays an important role in any military campaign. 
Those used in the armies of the Five Nations are based on the old army 
of Galifar and are given below in ascending order.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td><b>Title</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Ranking</b></td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>Soldier</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Sergeant</td>
<td align="center"> 1</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>Lieutenant</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Captain</td>
<td align="center">3</td>

<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>Major</td>
<td align="center">4</td>

<tr><td>Colonel</td>
<td align="center">5</td>
</tr>
<tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>General</td>
<td align="center">6</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Warlord</td>
<td align="center">7</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">In Karrnath, warlord is also a hereditary title bestowed
 on the highest-ranking nobles of the land. Those who rise to the top of
 the military chain receive an additional qualifier. Thus, Karrn General
 Thauram is also a warlord, but he serves under First Warlord Gruden 
ir'Erdei, who fills the role of warlord in terms of military rank.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Decorations</b></p>
<p align="left">Military decorations vary according to nation, and a 
complete list would require several pages. High-level decorations are 
often minor magic items designed to protect the honored hero. For 
example, Breland's greatest champions are often presented with <i>Handan's shroud,</i> a crimson <i>cloak of resistance +1.</i>
 Lesser decorations, such as the Black Badge of Shadukar or Cyre's Sword
 of the Southern Front, may be tied to specific battles or campaigns. In
 like manner, Karrns placed in command of an undead unit earn the right 
to wear the Skull of Atur. </p>
<p align="left">Other specific decorations will be detailed in future 
publications as battles are described in greater detail. However, you as
 DM should feel free to devise your own rewards for victorious heroes. </p>
