<p align="LEFT">Loot. So simple an idea: You defeat enemies, you get 
treasure. But when it comes to player egos, there may not be a more 
potent force in disrupting your game. Overpowered items, characters 
hoarding anything and everything that they might use, good treasure 
getting thrown by the wayside because it doesn't fit a perfect character
 build . . . what's a DM to do?</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b><img src="2007%20-%2003-27%20-%20Loot%21_files/dx20070327_sibling_loot1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="174" width="240">Greg:</b> So, about that dragon hoard . . . how come there was a <i>+3 halberd,</i> a <i>+2 animated heavy shield, </i>and a <i>pearl of power,</i>
 but nothing for my bard? I can't avoid a casual glance over to 
Alarion's or Jarvis's character sheet, where I notice that they have 
much better equipment than Adarrial. How about shipping some goodies my 
way once in awhile?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Hey, I'm just placing the items that the 
dice tell me to. It's not my fault that I rolled a 70 on the Minor 
Wondrous Items table.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Besides, it's not like you didn't get anything out of that adventure. What about the tiefling wizard's <i>wand of false life</i>? That's worth like four grand!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Yeah, and my 
character sheet is loaded with that sort of crap. This wand with 12 
charges, that scroll with three 4th-level druid spells that we might 
just need if we ever fight an army of shambling mounds, a <i>Murlynd's spoon</i>. "Hey, let's give it to Adarrial. He can use it!" I'm the Mikey of the party, only I <i>don't</i> like everything.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Have you ever thought that this might be 
your own fault? After all, you're the one who chose to play a bard. You 
should've known that you wouldn't get many sexy magic items.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The fighter gets first dibs on magic weapons, so he 
takes the shiny new longsword before you get a chance. He also needs a 
good AC more than you, so he gets the best <i>ring of protection</i>. Then the rogue gets first dibs on magic light armor, the wizard gets the magic staff, and the paladin gets the <i>cloak of Charisma</i>. What exactly are you expecting to get?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> So the truth 
comes out! You don't care about bards, and you don't care about making 
sure I have fun. Here I am, trying to play nice by filling in a niche 
role, and you do nothing to support me!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Careful, I think you just busted my Indignant-o-Meter.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> And are you seriously still rolling treasure randomly? Come on, that's so 1978!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b>I guess I just figured that my treasure 
hoards should be realistic. I mean, just because nobody in the party 
uses a trident doesn't mean that there aren't any magic tridents out 
there to find. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> I challenge you to find one non-merman PC who uses a trident. Do it. I'll buy pizza for a year if you do.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> That's "merfolk," you misogynist punk.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Besides, if this is such a sore spot, you shouldn't have
 waited so long to tell me. I guess I always figured that you were happy
 being the caretaker on "The Island of Misfit Wands." </p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Hey, make it 
so using a pissant wand takes something less than a standard action, and
 I'm all over it. But when I spend my action toput a <i>keen edge</i> on
 Jarvis's sword, and then he gets to attack three times and dish out 57 
points of damage (all while not critting, which makes my action pretty 
useless), something doesn't seem quite fair.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Playing a secondary role 
doesn't mean I should always get sloppy seconds on magic items too. You 
need to put some treasure in there that is undeniably ticketed straight 
to my poor, still-wielding-a<i>-+1-shortbow</i> hands . . . pronto.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b>That's a fair point. For the next 
adventure, I'll try putting down the percentile dice and just placing a 
few magic items that might be a little more appropriate for your 
character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> That's better.
 'Cause if you don't, maybe I'll just sell all that miscellaneous 
cast-off stuff nobody else wants to carry (but sure want the buffing 
benefits of, when it's time for my turn in the round) and buy myself 
something pretty.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b>Okay, now it's time for me to get up on the
 soapbox. Maybe the reason you don't have any nice gear is because Mr. 
Packrat can't bear parting with any of his poor little "cast-off" magic 
items. Alarion didn't just find that suit of <i>+2 mithral full plate armor</i> -- he paid for it out of his own share of treasure.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I know it's cool to find your best magic items hiding in
 a treasure chest, but there's only so much of that stuff I can place. 
Some of the treasure out there has to be in gold and gem form, after 
all, and I've said since Day 1 that you guys are welcome to buy any 
magic item in the game as long as I okay it first.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> I'll have my secretary draw up a list of items post-haste. Oh, Duran. . . .</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2003-27%20-%20Loot%21_files/dx20070327_sibling_loot2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="342" width="240">A few months later . . .</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b>So remember how I promised to put in a couple of good magic items targeted at your character? Now I'm starting to think that <i>helm of telepathy</i> you snagged from Nightfang Spire may not have been such a good idea.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> How so? Just 
because we aren't resorting to combat every time to beat the monsters 
doesn't mean it's overpowered. Besides, it really helps fit Adarrial's 
angle of being the information guy.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> But you keep ruining all my plots! How am I
 supposed to ever keep a secret from the party when you can just read 
everybody's minds all day long?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> What else are you supposed to do with a <i>helm of telepathy</i>? Makes for an expensive doorstop, and I didn't see you whining after you gave Thorgrimm his <i>+3 holy dwarven waraxe.</i> Can't you come up with some fool-proof plots (or at least <i>mind blanked </i>archvillains)?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> If there's any group of players that put 
the lie to the theory of a fool-proof plan, it's you guys. And yeah, I 
can come up with some excuses to protect a few characters, but that's 
gonna get old in a hurry. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Honestly, I'd been thinking about just having a thief 
sneak into your room at night to swipe the helm, but then I remembered 
how much you guys whined when that rust monster ate Alarion's halberd. 
So in the interests of avoiding seeing a room full of grown men bawling 
their eyes out, I thought I'd come talk to you and see if we could 
figure out something less . . . emotionally crippling.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> That sounds 
reasonable. Nothing cheeses us off more than the seemingly random item 
destruction. I'm still bitter about that time Quin spent a lot of time 
and XP brewing up a perfect toolbox of potions, only to see 90 percent 
of them wiped out by that nightwing that flew by. How about you swap out
 the <i>-pathy </i>for <i>-portation</i>? That's still good stuff for Adarrial, but it won't be so plot-wrecking.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> I think a one-for-one trade is unlikely -- 
I'm sure it has escaped your attention that the latter item is worth 
like three of the former -- but I'd be up for arranging some kind of 
"item swap."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> You speak as 
if we players have the magic item tables memorized and cross-indexed to 
the "wealth-by-character-level" table. For shame.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Ideally, though, I'd like it to be part of 
the actual campaign, rather than a behind-the-scenes retcon. How about 
this: At some point in the next adventure, a situation will come up when
 Adarrial realizes that he has to give up his <i>helm of telepathy</i>. I'm not saying exactly what that'll be -- I need to think about it a bit -- but I'll make sure it's pretty obvious.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What's more, I promise that the choice to do so won't 
come back and bite you on the ass. I won't trick you into giving it away
 to a disguised archvillain or anything like that -- it'll just be taken
 out of the party's hands.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In exchange, you give me a list of three magic items worth no more than, say, ten percent more than the <i>helm of telepathy,</i> and I'll put one of 'em in a treasure hoard in that same adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Spit in your 
hand and shake on it, and you've got a deal. Just make sure you set it 
up so the bard comes out looking like the magnanimous, self-sacrificing 
hero that he is.</span></p>
