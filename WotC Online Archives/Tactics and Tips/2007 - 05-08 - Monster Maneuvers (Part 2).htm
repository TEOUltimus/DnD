<p align="LEFT">Running a fight where adventurers take on several 
monsters can be frustrating for a Dungeon Master. While a player has 
plenty of time to contemplate her character's next move while other 
players enact their decisions, the DM has to run all the NPCs and pay 
attention to everything for the whole fight. To help the overworked get 
some planning power back, we're providing <i>Monster Maneuvers</i>, a series of <i>Tactics and Tips</i>
 articles that shows how monsters can become more effective combatants. 
We begin with Winning Tactics for Demons, to offset the Minions of the 
Abyss series of advice for adventurers. Having looked at general advice 
for running demons last time, we now look at specific advice for vrocks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vrock Victories</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Vrocks are a good example of demons with options that 
remain easy to run as a DM. A vrock can fly, fight well in melee, damage
 and stun foes near it, boost its combat ability (or the ability of an 
ally, if a vrock is so inclined) and in large numbers deal massive 
damage in an area. What vrocks don't have is a respectable long-range 
threat or Flyby Attack, which might help them get mired in losing melee 
contests if they aren't both careful and swift.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Getting Ready</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A vrock has some options if it knows it's getting into a
 battle. The first question is this: Does it have time (and fellow 
vrocks enough) to do a dance of ruin? If attacking from a very 
well-concealed position (tunnels beneath a castle or under guise of 
illusions provided by allies), causing 20d6 points of damage to their 
foes is a great way to start a battle. This is rarely going to be an 
option, but if it is, the vrocks need to seize it. Sadly once battle has
 begun, no vrock trio is likely to finish a dance of ruin unless their 
foes are badly outnumbered. In most cases, it's not even worth trying.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even if the dance isn't practical, a vrock can make use 
of even just 1 or 2 rounds before combat (or while flying in to combat 
if other demons can take the first round or two of ranged attacks). A 
vrock's <i>heroism</i> is nice if time allows for it -- and it always 
should. A vrock can use the ability once a day, and it lasts 2 hours. 
When writing out a statistics block for the vrock, include the <i>heroism</i> bonuses (with the original numbers in place as well, in case the <i>heroism</i> is dispelled).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Similarly, a vrock that receives any hint of a 
forthcoming battle (and with +24 on their Listen and Spot checks, vrocks
 often hear trouble coming well in advance) should put up its <i>mirror image</i>.
 The spell may not last more than a round against foes ready to drop 
images quickly, but that's still a round of attacks blunted. This 
ability is at will, so a vrock need not worry about wasting it. If a 
lull in battle leaves a vrock no good targets, putting the <i>mirror image</i> effect back up is always worthwhile.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Opening Salvo</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A vrock (or small group of vrocks) needs to get in close
 to vulnerable targets fast, and unleash a few special abilities before 
resorting to melee attacks. Vrocks do best by getting closer to "soft" 
targets for their special attacks before heavily armored paladins with 
holy weapons can draw their full attention.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Every 3 rounds, a vrock can unleash spores that damage 
every adjacent creature. These don't allow a save, and they deal 1d8 
points of damage initially, plus 10d4 points of damage total over the 
course of 10 rounds. While 1d4 a round doesn't sound like much, consider
 the impact of three vrocks all infecting a wizard or sorcerer with 
spores -- the spellcaster with low hit points would be taking 3d4 points
 of damage a round, or an average of 7.5 points of damage per round. 
Since the spores are a free action for the vrock and can be used every 3
 rounds, definitely take advantage of them. To help with keeping on top 
of when the spores are next available, write yourself a reminder 
wherever you keep track of the vrock's initiative. Multiple vrocks 
should concentrate their spore attacks if possible so that they can 
force a few targets to take multiple d4s of points of damage each round.
 Since the spores are negated by <i>neutralize poison,</i> it's reasonable to claim they are a poison effect and tanar'ri are immune, though this is not explicitly stated.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The vrock's other special attack that should be called 
out early is its stunning screech. This can be done only once per hour, 
but it is a supernatural ability (thus it does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity) with a good radius and a high Fortitude save. This is an 
excellent way to force rogues and arcane spellcasters to lose a round of
 action and leave themselves vulnerable. Unlike the spores, which vrocks
 should use together, the stunning screeches should be staggered. If 
three vrocks each make a screech on three successive rounds, there's a 
chance a foe may lose multiple rounds of action. And the screech does 
not affect demons, making it perfect for massed attacks. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition a vrock can use <i>greater teleport</i> and <i>telekinesis</i>. Of course with Concentration +20, a vrock needs to roll a 10 for <i>telekinesis</i> and 12 for <i>greater teleportation</i>,
 making them iffy propositions to flee a losing fight. Teleporting away 
is a good choice for a last resort, but the abilities are better used 
earlier, or in tandem with a blocker to keep foes from melee range. A 
vrock may teleport into close combat with weaker foes, placing itself so
 that it's difficult for fighters and rogues to reach or flank it. It 
may also use <i>telekinesis</i> while flying over a battle to disarm 
foes. Front-line fighters are unlikely to fail opposed checks from the 
spell, but a vrock might well disarm a wizard of her staff, a rogue of 
her melee weapons, or a cleric of his magic item of healing. Softening 
up foes in this way pays heavy dividends later on, especially if it can 
be done while other fiends are already engaging the heroes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fiendish Fighting</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">After proper preparation and an opening wave of attacks,
 a vrock is likely to find itself mired in melee combat with foes 
prepared to kill demons. A 9th-level paladin with a holy sword can be 
expected to have an attack bonus of +19/+14 or more, meaning the vrock 
has little chance of being missed once the <i>mirror image</i> ends. If 
the paladin deals a mere 25 points of damage on average per blow, the 
vrock is going to survive only 5 rounds of direct combat with that one 
character. There's no good way for the vrock to boost its Armor Class, 
so its only defense is a strong offense or good maneuvering.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A full attack routine from a vrock is five strikes ranging from +15 to +13 (+17 to +15 with <i>heroism</i>).
 Even if all those hit, the vrock is doing an average of 52.5 points of 
damage per round. Realistically the vrock can expect to do between 
one-half to one-third of that, or 26 to 17 points of damage per round. 
That means over the 5 rounds it's lively to survive in combat with just 
one prepared 9th-level foe, the vrock deals about 82 points of damage --
 less than it takes in the same time, and less than it probably needs to
 drop its target. A vrock forced into direct melee combat with even one 
well-equipped 9th-level front-line fighter loses a fair fight. Opening 
tactics may swing things in the vrock's favor, but few fiends want to 
count on that.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If possible, the vrock should use reach to its 
advantage. A vrock that can get within range of a spellcaster forces 
defensive casting checks, and the vrock has Combat Reflexes to take 
advantage of any attacks of opportunity that come up. A position that 
prevents rogues from flanking is also useful if one exists. Rather than 
fly to such a locale, the vrock may wish to teleport in, both avoiding 
attacks of opportunities and granting an element of surprise.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Development</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Vrocks can advance up to 30 Hit Dice, earning an 
additional seven feats, and they gain one feat with just 2 additional 
Hit Dice. Nothing boosts a vrock's survivability more than Hover (<i>MM</i>
 304). This allows a vrock to hover just above a foe, using reach to 
make full attack actions on an enemy below them while being out of reach
 of many weapons. Even better, it creates a cloud that conceals the 
vrock from ranged attacks made from safe distances, and it forces 
concentration checks from nearby spellcasters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">After Hover, an advanced vrock may wish to increase its 
stunning screech's DC with Ability Focus, increase its maneuverability 
with Flyby Attack, and take Improved Natural weapons and Improved 
Natural Armor for any remaining feat slots.</p>
