<p align="LEFT"><b>DM:</b> I need to talk to you away from the table . . . and bring your character sheet.</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT">One of the tensest moments in any <b>D&amp;D</b> session
 comes when the DM takes a player aside for a one-on-one chat about 
something that has just happened in the game. Whether the conversational
 equivalent of a passed note describing the horrific creature he has 
spotted in the shadows or a lengthy discussion about the ghostly spirit 
that just possessed him, the very concept of a secret shared between the
 DM and a single player puts everyone else on the table at edge.</p>
<p align="LEFT">What's going on?</p>
<p align="LEFT">What does he know that we don't?</p>
<p align="LEFT">And what are the rest of us going to do about it?</p>
<p align="LEFT">In most <b>D&amp;D</b> games, the players sitting around
 the table share a basic assumption -- that everything occurring within 
the game is known by everyone in the adventuring party -- which creates a
 bond of trust.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When one player gains knowledge that isn't shared with 
the others, it creates a situation of inequality, which in turn can 
foster emotions among the other players ranging from suspicion to 
jealousy to outright anger.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This month, our siblings discuss how best to handle the situation from both sides of the screen.</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Okay, you've finished looting the Ruined 
Shrine of Set and made your way back to the city of Sigil. Greg, I need 
to talk to you away from the table . . . and bring your character sheet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Ummm, okay.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><img src="2007%20-%2002-27%20-%20I%20Have%20a%20Secret_files/dx20070227_sibling_suleidan.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="184" width="173">There's
 not much else for a player to say at that point, other than "do I need 
to bring 4d6 with me?" In this case, I was playing <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20010730a">Suleidan Kithkani</a>
 , a corsair-turned-slave-turned-wealthy-merchant-turned-mercenary in 
Sigil. He and his fellow Taskmasters (our mercenary guild) had ransacked
 the temple, and he had picked up a magic flail that looked like a fine 
trophy. While it certainly could be used in combat, Suleidan was so 
skilled with his cutlass that he'd only turn to it as a last resort.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Or so it seemed . . .</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">The flail held a curse, 
slowly changing Suleidan. Unlike a possession or doppelganger encounter 
that often last only one or two gaming sessions, Andy had set this one 
up to be played out over the course of months. I had a secret, and it 
was one that I could have a lot of fun with.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Thinking back on the 
Taskmasters, Suleidan was easily the most normal of the group. The 
minotaur was a doomguard bent on destruction, the enchanter started 
bleeding every time he cast a spell, the ogre mage's combined Wisdom and
 Charisma barely hit double-digits, and the githzerai rogue was so 
revenge-driven that he once stole 50,000 gp from the party because we 
didn't raise him from the dead fast enough.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">That being said, Suleidan and his relatively calm Society of Sensation demeanor was headed for new territory.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Looking back now, I don't recall exactly 
why a cursed weapon designed to change its owner's alignment to lawful 
evil showed up in the game. Was it an attempt by me to introduce a 
significant new plot thread into the game, or was it just one of those 
old-school things that most groups dealt with quickly and moved on? (For
 that matter, was it something I chose to use or just an element of some
 published adventure I was using? I flat-out don't remember.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">In any of my earlier campaigns, such an item would 
likely have been no more than a minor event that came up, was dealt 
with, and then forgotten. Anyone raised on classic dungeon-crawling 1st 
Edition <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns is likely all-too-familiar with cursed 
magic items, and these veterans quickly learned to view them as 
annoyances to be identified and overcome post-haste.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2002-27%20-%20I%20Have%20a%20Secret_files/dx20070227_sibling_WPM_BackCover.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="122" width="240">But this wasn't a grade-school or even a high-school campaign; this was a character-driven <b>Planescape</b> campaign, the first <b>D&amp;D</b>
 campaign our group had played as adults. While it didn't involve as 
much whole-cloth world creation as my later campaigns (Bloodlines and 
Umber), as you can see from Greg's description above, every character in
 the game was loaded with personal and mechanical quirks. This was an 
unusual collection of oddballs, and everyone in the group embraced that 
wholeheartedly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So when Suleidan started redecorating his manor (which 
also served as Taskmaster HQ) using a serpent motif, I guess nobody 
really thought that anything unusual was at play.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Suleidan was 
crafted as a pretty straight-forward chaotic good, so transitioning to 
the diametrically opposed lawful evil was a big shift. A scoundrel with a
 good heart, Suleidan's means to his mercenary ends became much more 
deliberate as the curse set in. But he couldn't just start killing 
innocents to feed the serpent god's curse -- this was going to take time
 (which fit well with the new LE Suleidan, who could now put some 
serious machinations into his plans of advancement and revenge).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> The single most important thing for a DM 
to keep in mind when a player is privy to a secret is to keep the game 
fair to everyone involved. Just as it's not fair when one character has 
access to more power than others, it's equally unfair to let one player 
have extra fun at the rest of the group's expense.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At its heart, <b>D&amp;D</b> functions best as a 
cooperative activity between the players who are working together toward
 a shared goal. Normally, the DM serves as a more-or-less neutral 
arbiter, describing the situations and adjudicating the outcomes of 
player decisions. But when one character's goals become at odds with the
 rest of the group, the DM must take a more active role in ensuring a 
fun, fair time for all. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Exactly how to accomplish that goal varies dramatically 
by the situation. When one of the characters becomes possessed by a 
ghost, make sure that the ghost's goals don't directly oppose the 
group's, so that they can cooperate on some tasks while simultaneously 
looking for the best way to free their comrade. When the ruler of the 
elven kingdom orders the lone elf in the party to leave the service of 
the human government with which the party works, make sure to leave the 
party a way out of the untenable situation (perhaps by performing a big 
favor for the elves).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In Suleidan's case, it would have been easy for Greg to 
take advantage of the rest of the group's lack of knowledge about his 
"condition." He could have secretly withheld assistance during key 
encounters or sabotaged the group's ability to succeed on missions, 
falling back on the excuse of "well, I'm just playing my new alignment."
 </p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Just because 
my character is evil doesn't mean I want to slaughter my party. They're a
 means to an end -- it's a lot of work recruiting a group of grunts, and
 why would Suleidan waste time doing that when he has perfectly good 
damage sponges already living in his manor?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> But as much fun as that might have been 
for Greg, it wouldn't have been fair to the rest of the players. Just 
because Greg had access to a secret doesn't make the rest of the players
 second-class participants in the game. As DM, I had to balance the new 
personality I'd thrust upon this character with the necessity of 
ensuring that everyone felt equally involved and invested in the 
campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In this case, Greg and I realized that the change would 
be gradual but would involve clues that canny party members could 
recognize. Most importantly, though, we decided that the new alignment 
and personality wouldn't significantly change his contributions within a
 given adventure. During the average combat, he was the same old 
Suleidan . . . mostly.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Months passed,
 and the new Suleidan began to show through. He took the group on a 
journey to a distant world so he could get enchanted with arm-length 
serpent tattoos that would animate themselves to deflect enemies' 
attacks. The flail became his regular weapon -- clearly a sub-optimal 
game choice since he was so skilled in the cutlass, but what was I to 
say? I was cursed, and I wasn't holding back. To pull off the secret, I 
couldn't just make the changes in roleplaying terms. I had to make the 
entirety of the character embrace his new self.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">The other PCs didn't really
 notice much at first. The frail wizard Yrl saw an ally who was a little
 quicker with the kills, and to his order-driven mind Suleidan was a 
more effective leader. Dawthdun and Tai didn't care much -- they just 
wanted to be pointed at ways to make more gold and/or blow stuff up. 
Kur'lakk had some doubts, as did Slumber, the priest of Thoth. But the 
money was still flowing, so what was a mercenary band to do other than 
follow its leader?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2002-27%20-%20I%20Have%20a%20Secret_files/dx20070227_sibling_dracolich.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="181" width="241"><b>Andy: </b>
 And follow him they did . . . until the fateful day that Suleidan, his 
loyal bodyguard Ankus (blissfully unaware of his master's new 
personality), and a few of the Taskmasters found themselves the 
prisoners of a great skeletal dragon lairing deep in the Gray Waste of 
Hades.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The characters had invaded its home and attacked its 
servants. What compensation were they prepared to offer in exchange for 
this indignity (and their lives)?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> When a villain
 asks the party "what will you give me to let you go?" usually a long, 
heated discussion ensues. "Can I give up my best magic weapon? What 
about that ring you have? How much gold do we have on us?" Blah blah 
blah.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Not this time. Without hesitating, Suleidan pointed to Ankus and said, "Him."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">The other players were 
shocked. Before any of them could react, the dracolich had its lunch and
 we were on our way back to Sigil. What surprised me most of all was how
 instinctive the decision was. I hadn't schemed to sacrifice Ankus (or 
any other party member) . . . it just came to me, in one of those 
perfect roleplaying moments. And Suleidan's secret was most certainly 
out of the bag. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Now it was time for the other players to 
start initiating "away-from-the-table" discussions with me. They started
 asking questions, and I answered them as honestly as I could . . . 
within the reasonable limits of their characters' knowledge and 
awareness. It's not like plenty of facts weren't out there in plain 
sight, so it didn't take them long to figure out that this wasn't the 
same Suleidan they remembered.</p>
<p align="LEFT">By the time the next session rolled around, the rest of 
the Taskmasters had pegged the cause of the change and had also 
researched a potential solution. Of course, they had to leave their dear
 leader just a bit in the dark, so they concocted a fake job to locate 
and slay the Great Dragon of the Desert . . . coincidentally, on the 
same world where the cursed flail had been found. There was a kernel of 
truth to their story -- the dragon was indeed the object of the journey 
-- but it wasn't a hunt they had planned, but an artifact-destroying 
mission. They just hoped that the fragmentary tales they'd pieced 
together regarding the only means of destroying the tools of Set would 
work . . . and that enough of Suleidan's mind (and body) would survive 
the ordeal.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In my mind, this was a perfect turnaround. The original 
secret-keeper was now the one who didn't have all the information, and 
those who'd been played like suckers could have their moment in the sun.
 The disempowered now became empowered, and they used that opportunity 
to right the ship of the campaign rather than further upset it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once again, as DM I had to play everything straight. 
Nobody got special treatment during the ensuing mission. And when those 
in the know watched the Great Dragon swallow up their comrade, flail and
 all, they knew they'd earned that victory. (The fact that they rescued 
their now-"purified" teammate from the dragon's belly moments later was 
well-deserved icing on the cake.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Plus it 
provided the cool visual of a reborn Suleidan rising up out of the 
steaming carcass, body and spirit cleansed by the Great Dragon's 
essence. In a campaign of many memorable plane-spanning moments, this 
arc was one of the best. The secret had changed the party dynamics, 
challenged PCs in a new way, added cool bits to the storyline, and let 
everyone feel "in control" at various times.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">So the next time your DM 
says "I need to talk to you alone," stifle that instinct to tear up your
 character sheet. Embrace the secret. Explore new roleplaying territory.
 Enjoy your hidden knowledge. And go easy on the hired help.</span></p>
