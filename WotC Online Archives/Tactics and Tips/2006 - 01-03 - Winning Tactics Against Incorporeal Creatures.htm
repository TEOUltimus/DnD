 one of the scariest types of monsters that a character can face? How 
about one that you can't even touch! Incorporeal creatures offer several
 unique and powerful challenges for characters to face. We'll take a 
look at some ways for you to beat down these creatures that aren't even 
technically there . . .</p>
<p align="left">Before we begin, you may want to refresh your memory about the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_incorporealsubtype')">incorporeal subtype</a> by reading its glossary entry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Existing on a Different Level</b></p>
<p align="left">Incorporeal creatures interact with the real world only 
through concerted effort. They ignore nonmagical attacks and can pass 
through walls without effort. They are completely silent and usually the
 only way you know one is present is when it reaches out and does <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydrain')">ability drain</a> damage. The vast majority of incorporeal creatures are <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_undeadtype')">undead</a>, which comes with its own list of problems, but ironically, also supplies more options on how to fight them and survive.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fighting Incorporeal Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">Taking on an incorporeal creature can be an exasperating affair. Unless you're prepared or have the right sort of weapons and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spells')">spells</a>,
 you may find that the best defense against them is to flee and fight 
another day. However, if you have to fight, you can keep several tactics
 in mind when facing a creature made up of nothingness.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stay Far Away!:</b> Most incorporeal creatures deal <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a> from <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_touchattack')">touch attacks</a>. If you can avoid <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_melee')">melee</a>, do so, and assault the creature with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attacks</a> (preferably magical!) and spells. However, most incorporeal creatures can <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fly')">fly</a> and have high <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speeds</a>, so remaining distant could be difficult. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rogue')">Rogues</a>, denied their sneak attack ability, should focus exclusively on ranged attacks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Magic Weapons Are Critical:</b> The best defense of 
incorporeal creatures is the fact that they are completely unaffected by
 attacks that are nonmagical by nature. Regular weapons, fire, acid, 
dropping stones -- none of these have any effect whatsoever. And then, 
if a weapon is magical, attacking an incorporeal creature with one still
 has a 50% chance of missing outright. Half a chance is better than 
nothing, of course.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-03%20-%20Winning%20Tactics%20Against%20Incorporeal%20Creatures_files/dx0103tt_ghosts2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="215" width="247"><b><i>Ghost Touch</i> Weapons and Armor:</b> If you can afford it, using <i>ghost touch</i> weapons (see <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, <i></i>page 224) and armor (page 219) is extremely effective against incorporeal creatures. <i>Ghost touch</i> weapons have a +1 bonus to the base price, putting it out of reach for lower-level characters. <i>Ghost touch</i> armor has a whopping +3 bonus to the base price, but it is a must-have for your high-level ghost hunters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>There Is No Cover:</b> Incorporeal creatures can pass
 through solid objects, so, in most cases, walls, floors, and ceilings 
are relatively meaningless to them. They can hide in the floor or inside
 a wall, striking out from solid cover. An incorporeal creature that 
uses this tactic effectively gains a +4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">AC</a> for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cover')">cover</a> and may remain in total <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_concealment')">concealment</a> before striking. Keep your back up against an ally to prevent hit-and-run <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flank')">flank</a>
 attacks against multiple incorporeal creatures and use readied actions 
to strike once you have a good idea where they are hiding.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Go the Undead Angle:</b> Considering that most incorporeal creatures are undead, attacking them from this angle is probably your best bet. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_turn')">Turning</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rebukeundead')">rebuking</a>
 are the most effective methods for dealing with incorporeal undead, 
along with spells designed specifically against undead (that's a 
different article altogether). Holy water is another useful trick, but 
to use this tactic effectively against an incorporeal undead creature, 
you must pour it directly on the creature, meaning you must be adjacent 
to make the attack -- indirect splashing has no effect. However, even 
this attack has a 50% of missing the creature entirely.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stock Up on <i>Restoration</i> Spells:</b> Most incorporeal creatures deal <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydamage')">ability damage</a> with their touch attacks. These effects can be particularly nasty. Make sure your cleric has <i>restoration</i> prepared. Scrolls of<i> lesser restoration</i> are relatively cheap (150 gp) and more than worth their weight in gold when your group is assaulted by dread wraiths.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Magic Against Incorporeal Creatures</b><i></i></p>
<p align="left">Unless you're armed with magic weapons, preferably those with the <i>ghost touch</i>
 special ability, or capable of dealing with undead creatures (as 
described above), the best way to assault an incorporeal creature is 
with spells that have the force descriptor. These spells affect 
incorporeal creatures as if they were solid. However, a few nonforce 
spells are just as handy.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Magic Missile</b>:</i> The lowly <i>magic missile</i>
 spell works great against incorporeal creatures. Almost as important, 
they ignore the potential cover bonus that incorporeal creatures might 
gain from partially hiding inside a wall or the floor, as described 
above.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Mage Armor </i>and<i> Holy Aura: </i></b><i>Mage armor</i><b></b>is a cheap, effective way to provide some additional protection against incorporeal attacks -- a <i>wand of mage armor</i> can quickly provide your entire group with some defense. <i>Holy aura</i> is a high-level spell, but it offers immense protection against incorporeal creatures.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Wall of Force:</b></i> If you're of sufficiently high enough level, casting <i>wall of force</i> can at least keep one side potentially free from flanking. Remember, however, that unlike most wall spells, the <i>wall of force</i> can form only a single straight line -- cast it in front of you and make the incorporeal creature waste time going around it.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Otiluke's Resilient Sphere </i>and <i>Otiluke's Telekinetic Sphere:</i></b>
 These spells makes a perfect traps, since they completely enclose an 
incorporeal creature for the duration of the spells. Box up the wraith, 
then set yourself up for the prime time to strike or use it as temporary
 shelter while you cast spells or drink potions. <i>Otiluke's telekinetic sphere</i>
 can also move the trapped creature wherever you want it -- preferably 
as far away as possible. However, the creature is also effectively 
immune to any sort of attacks, so guide it where you want before 
releasing the spell and pummeling the creature to your advantage.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Antimagic Field:</b></i> It might be overkill, but
 this spell causes any incorporeal undead creature that passes through 
it to wink out. Just keep in mind that your spells are suppressed during
 the duration of this spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Bigby's Hands:</b></i> These high-level spells can smack around an incorporeal creature as if it is solid. The lowest level version, <i>Bigby's interposing hand</i>, is the most effective at keeping an incorporeal creature at bay, since it follows the creature wherever it goes.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Ethereal Jaunt and Etherealness</i>:</b><i>Editor's Note</i>: there is indeed a correction for these, as has been pointed out on the message boards; to quote from <i>Libris Mortis</i>,
 pg 143: "An incorporeal creature is visible but can't be affected (or 
be affected by) corporeal objects.... It still exists fully on the Prime
 Material plane, despite its inability to interact with most objects. An
 ethereal creature exists not on the Material Plane, but on the Ethereal
 Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane at all points.... It can't 
interact with objects on the Material Plane in any way. Even most of the
 limited options avilable to an incorporeal creature -- such as ghost 
touch weapons and armor -- don't work for an ethereal creature...."</p>
