<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2004-11%20-%20Tougher%20and%20Meaner%20Than%20You%20%28Part%203%29_files/dx0411tt_tacticstips_greendr1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="208" width="240">It's
 the Year of Dragons! As a part of this celebration, we're going to be 
taking a closer look at these iconic beasts, their abilities, and some 
of the best ways to fight them . . . and come back alive. Over the 
course of this series, we'll focus on the true dragons described in the <i>Monster Manual</i>,
 and although we'll touch on the tactics and abilities that all dragons 
possess, the purpose of these articles is to explore their unique powers
 and their temperament, plus show how they use their lairs to their 
advantage.</p>
<p align="left">Next up is the fearsome and belligerent green dragon, 
horror of the forest. Green dragons are among the most conniving of the 
dragons, and they tend to have the most love for politics and intrigue. 
Given the chance, they would rule their woodland home in the manner of 
some "benevolent" dictator.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Terrain</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>The Dragon's Side</b></p>
<p align="left">To enhance the green dragon's natural fighting prowess, stealthy nature, and command of both people and plants, <i>Races of the Wild</i>
 has several feats, spells, and tactics that work just as well for 
dragons as other humanoids. The feats that appeal to dragons most focus 
on their flying: Aerial Reflexes, Aerial Superiority, Born Flyer, Diving
 Charge, and Improved Flight. The Winged Warrior tactical feat lets them
 perform daring maneuvers in the air.</p>
<p align="left">Because of their intimate knowledge of their forest 
homes, green dragons that pick up levels in cleric commonly choose the 
Plant domain to make the trees, shrubs, and vines into allies. Or, as 
befitting their subtype, they might also pick the Sky domain to make 
their flying forays over their territory more dangerous. Also, the book 
describes ways that the other denizens of a green dragon's forest -- 
elves, halflings, and the like, may use specific tactics against these 
majestic beasts. Green dragons would be all too aware of these methods .
 . .</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Green dragons live in deep, thick, and preferably 
ancient forests, where the trees grow massive. Their coloration allows 
them to blend into the thick canopy and underbrush, and their long necks
 can be mistaken for a huge trunk from a distance. Green dragons have 
Bluff, Hide, and Move Silently as class skills, so despite their bulk, 
they can stalk the forest as stealthily as a cat. Remember that they are
 just as likely to attack from the thick underbrush as they dive from 
the branches above. Like the black dragon, green dragons are relatively 
poor flyers, making flying movement within the forest tricky.</p>
<p align="left">Because they can breathe underwater, green dragons 
sometimes stalk prey while hiding underneath forest ponds and rivers 
deep enough to hide their bulk. They sometimes use this ability to drag 
opponents underneath with a successful grapple attack (see the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060328a">Fighting Black Dragons</a> for more information on this tactic).</p>
<p align="left">Green dragons prefer making their lairs in caves 
situated in high, sheer cliffs, where they have a commanding view of the
 area, with the entrance located at the base, away from sight -- 
preferably beneath a waterfall or covered in dense vegetation. Realize 
that the interior of this cliff is probably riddled with tunnels and 
dead ends. They can't burrow, so blocking off escape routes with <i>move earth</i>
 or similar spells can hinder their movement -- but then you're stuck 
fighting the green dragon in its own lair... with it angry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Abilities</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2004-11%20-%20Tougher%20and%20Meaner%20Than%20You%20%28Part%203%29_files/dx0411tttacticstips_greendr2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="340" width="240">The
 special abilities of green dragons show a combination of their 
dominance over the plants of the forest they live in and the beings that
 they might encounter within -- <i>suggestion, plant growth, dominate person</i>, and <i>command plants</i>.
 Green dragons are bossy and domineering, and they prefer humiliating an
 opponent before going in for the kill. As they grow older, most green 
dragons pick up additional spells meant to control others, such as <i>charm monster</i> and <i>charm person,</i> or they choose ones that make them stealthier or harder to find, such as <i>hallucinatory terrain, invisibility, misdirection</i>, and <i>seeming</i>.</p>
<p align="left">Adult and older green dragons make extensive use of their <i>suggestion</i>
 ability to bend humanoids to their will. If you encounter one that 
doesn't outright attack, be aware that it probably intends to sway your 
opinion with special abilities or spells. If someone in your group 
starts acting strange, be prepared to react accordingly and know that 
they are not acting of their own free will.</p>
<p align="left">Green dragons use <i>plant growth</i> to cover up the 
entrance to their lair, to hide pit traps that surround it, and to make 
life miserable for their opponents during combat.</p>
<p align="left">Ancient and older green dragons employ <i>dominate person</i> with impunity, even out of sheer boredom or amusement. Be wary of them attempting this while hiding, and using <i>dominate person</i> to distract the others, or lead them into a trap (such as into one of the covered pits, as described above).</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dealing with a Green Dragon's Breath Weapon</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The green dragon's breath weapon is a cone of corrosive 
gas (acid), so make sure that if you attack one, you try to surround it 
from all sides to minimize the number of people in your group affected 
by this attack. The same armor, scrolls, and spells that help against 
black dragons apply to green dragons as well.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Wyrms use <i>command plants</i> to turn their forest 
homes into a flailing nightmare of vines and branches. If stalking prey 
(or, in the unlikely case of fleeing), they use this ability to make it 
appear that they are heading in another direction, due to the trees and 
underbrush moving about as if a large animal were running through them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Tactics</b></p>
<p align="left">Green dragons possess the Air subtype, and thus they can
 be rebuked by a cleric with the Earth domain -- attempt this only 
against younger dragons. Green dragons fight just as well on the ground,
 in the water, and in the air, so the best place to fight one is beneath
 the earth. Use <i>move earth</i>, <i>earth to mud</i>, and other spells or abilities to bog the green dragon down so that it must spend most of its time trying to get out.</p>
