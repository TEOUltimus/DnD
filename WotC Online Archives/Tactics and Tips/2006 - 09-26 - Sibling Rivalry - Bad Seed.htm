<p align="LEFT">This column often focuses on conflicts between a player 
and his DM. But sometimes, conflicts arise between players, and the DM 
is obligated to step in as an arbiter or proxy. In this month's Sibling 
Rivalry, the authors tackle one of the most common intra-party 
conflicts: hogging the spotlight.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><img src="2006%20-%2009-26%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Bad%20Seed_files/dx0926tt_deal2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="187" width="240">Setting:
 A hole-in-the-wall taqueria in downtown Renton. Andy, the DM, and Greg,
 one of his players, are sitting down to a tasty lunch. But somebody has
 an agenda beyond gorging on burritos . . .</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> So I think we need to talk about your 
character. When you created Adarrial, you described him as a 
fast-talking charlatan, specializing in bluffing, conning, and otherwise
 swindling folk out of their hard-earned gold.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> That's pretty 
close to the concept. Coming late to the group, I saw that they had most
 of the major roles already slotted -- cleric, wizard, melee combat, 
ranged combat -- so my character would be able to do a little of a lot. 
Bingo-bango-bongo, I had myself a bard. But not a singing and dancing 
one -- this guy's all about talking. His Gather Information gets the 
party into trouble, and his Diplomacy gets us out of it. Along the way, 
if he happens to take a little extra money from the duke or double-cross
 the church to get what he wants, so be it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Yep, I remember sitting around talking 
about those ideas back before the campaign started. He seemed like a 
really interesting character, and a good way for me to get story ideas 
to the group.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But starting a few sessions ago, I noticed some of the 
players getting restless, and, after the last game, I overheard Chris 
grumbling that he'd made only three attack rolls in four hours of play.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then on Tuesday, I got an email from Joe, who was 
wondering when we were getting back to that cave complex your group 
hadn't finished clearing out, and I realized that it's been ages since 
you guys were actually killing monsters and looting dungeons. Lately, it
 seems like almost half of every session centers around Adarrial 
interacting with various NPCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> But that's 
what Adarrial is good at. When I picked my character, I didn't want to 
duplicate somebody else's schtick so I came up with my own. Because it 
doesn't involve swinging a sword in some dank pit of a dungeon, they're 
complaining? Besides, what's stopping them from talking to their 
important NPCs?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Nothing, but their interactions are much 
shorter than yours, since they don't have much in the way of useful 
skills or tactics to use in such encounters. When an emissary from the 
elven kingdom contacts Eandrynn, it's a brief chat designed to move the 
story along. But when Adarrial talks to the same guy, that's a half-hour
 of game time when you're rolling dice and nobody else is, and that's 
what folk are starting to . . . well, resent is maybe too strong a word,
 but they can see it from where they are now.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><img src="2006%20-%2009-26%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Bad%20Seed_files/dx0926tt_research.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="404" width="240"><b>Greg:</b>
 Ingrates! I got us that deed to the keep because of my contacts, and 
the palms I greased at the merchants' guild showed us that secret 
entrance to the warehouse. But to get that sort of information, I need 
to talk to a lot of people. Six inns per night, that's my motto. Plus it
 seems like my hard work off the battlefield is making life easier and 
more lucrative for the entire party, so I don't see a problem.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Nobody's complaining that Adarrial isn't 
useful, and I certainly appreciate having a character who makes it easy 
for me to introduce new adventures.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That said, it's one thing to use your skills in pursuit 
of adventure, but remember that time last session when you insisted on 
tracking down every weapon merchant in town trying to get the best price
 on a +1 bow? Or the session before that, when you wouldn't let the 
party leave town in pursuit of the slave caravan until you'd spent two 
days researching the family history of the slavemaster?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Well, I made 
this character because these were the things I wanted to do. They're 
part of the rules, and these choices of skills and abilities certainly 
don't make Adarrial too powerful. So I'm supposed to let those skills 
just rot? Plus I enjoy the "man about town" aspect of the character -- 
that's not only when I get to shine, but I have fun doing it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> The problem is that the scenes where 
Adarrial shines don't really allow any other characters to participate 
meaningfully. Thorgrimm's happiest when he's slaying stuff, but 
everybody can get into a combat scene easily, so nobody feels left out. 
But when Adarrial's working the locals, or negotiating a deal with the 
duke, the rest of the players are pretty much just watching the two of 
us talk. Making an occasional "aid another" Diplomacy check at +0 isn't 
exactly as thrilling as landing an axe blow or detonating a fireball.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> It's not like Adarrial is useless in a combat, but chipping in a <i>haste</i>
 spell here and a few points of damage with my shortbow there doesn't do
 much for me, and often times those contributions are marginal at best.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> That suggests to me that Adarrial may be a 
little too focused on noncombat encounters. A little intrigue here and 
there is good for a game, but it's getting pretty clear to me that the 
rest of the group is itching for "a little less conversation, a little 
more action," as the King would say.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Do you want 
to do away with those interaction scenes all together? You said how they
 help you move the plot along, which seems pretty necessary.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Agreed. I'm just suggesting that you, as 
Adarrial, be aware that when your character is doing his thing, the rest
 of the group's doing nothing. You may want to pick and choose your "big
 moments" a little more judiciously -- if you want an in-depth 
discussion with the chamberlain about all the rumors floating around 
town, that's not a good use of the group's time.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><img src="2006%20-%2009-26%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Bad%20Seed_files/dx0926tt_deal1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="196" width="241"><b>Greg: </b>
 What if we try moving that talky stuff out of the sessions when 
everyone is there, and tackle them over email or solo sessions? That way
 I can still do the things I want to do, but it doesn't burgle away 
everyone else's time at the gaming table.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> That sounds fine to me, but it's only half
 the issue. If you don't think Adarrial's interesting enough to play in 
combat scenes, we need to find something fun for him to do in a fight, 
because otherwise you're just as bored then as the others are during 
your interaction scenes. Are there any spells you could learn that would
 make you feel more "active" in a fight, or is there a prestige class or
 multiclass option that would help?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> If the duke 
continues to treat elves like second-class citizens, that choice might 
be easy. This half-elf wants justice, and a few levels in holy liberator
 could not only help crystallize Adarrial's diplomatic role, but he'd 
become a better combatant.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Swapping out a feat or two 
and changing some spells could change the effectiveness of Adarrial 
without betraying his original concept, either.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> And in turn, I'll talk to the other players
 about finding ways for them to be more involved in negotiation 
encounters. Fair's fair, after all -- if you're going to modify your 
character to fit with their needs, it's reasonable to ask the same from 
them. Maybe buying a few ranks in a useful skill that can contribute, or
 establishing a contact that can help out during an investigation, or 
something of that ilk.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> The more, the 
merrier. Adarrial wasn't intended as a way to pull the spotlight away 
from other characters (but hey, he's a bard, so a little 
spotlight-hogging is natural).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">But this also doesn't mean I
 want Adarrial to become a plot device to get the other characters into 
action. I want to gain some benefits from investing time and resources 
into abilities that don't manifest when push comes to shove against the 
frost giant Jarl.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Fair enough. I'll make sure to include 
interaction scenes that contribute materially to the party's success, 
and you agree to keep Adarrial's gift of gab from crowding out the rest 
of the players' fun.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Hey, what kind of name is Jarl, anyway?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Scotch/Romanian.</p>
