<p align="LEFT"><b>Fighting Blue Dragons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-04%20-%20Tougher%20and%20Meaner%20Than%20You%20%28Part%202%29_files/dx0404tt_tacticstips_bluedr1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="203" width="250">It's
 the Year of Dragons! As a part of this celebration, we're going to be 
taking a closer look at these iconic beasts, their abilities, and some 
of the best ways to fight them . . . and come back alive. Over the 
course of this series, we'll focus on the true dragons described in the <i>Monster Manual</i>,
 and although we'll touch on the tactics and abilities that all dragons 
possess, the purpose of these articles is to explore their unique powers
 and their temperament, plus show how they use their lairs to their 
advantage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This week, we turn our attention to the cruel and 
terrible king of the desert, the blue dragon. Vain, territorial, and 
haughty, blue dragons claim large swathes of land as their own and 
torment any creatures that dare to enter into it without their 
permission -- and sometimes even with it!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Terrain</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Blue dragons live in desolate, inhospitable deserts full
 of flowing sand. Their bodies are exquisitely designed for both 
burrowing through sand and soaring for hours above the dunes. Because of
 this, parties rarely can use the terrain to their advantage when 
fighting a blue dragon. Instead, they should be mindful of the terrain 
so they don't fall into a blue dragon's trap.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Dragon's Side</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">To make better tactical use of a blue dragon's abilities, you might consult <i>Sandstorm</i>;
 the book offers a number of spells these dragons might use against 
parties already weakened on treks across the desert, such as <i>parching touch</i>, <i>sunstroke</i>, <i>desiccate</i>, and <i>tormenting thirst</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Likewise, the first chapter includes a number of natural
 and supernatural hazards a blue dragon might incorporate around its 
lair, from furnace wind to leech salt flats. As mentioned in the 
article, blue dragons can use the illusion of ruins to bait well-laden 
adventuring parties -- or they might build their lairs near actual 
ruins, using their undead denizens as guardians or ambushing parties 
that emerge with looted wealth.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Because they can burrow through the earth at a 
remarkable speed, one of blue dragons' favorite tactics is to dig 
themselves into the sand with just the very top of their heads exposed. 
If you have to go into a blue dragon's lair, typically caverns deep 
beneath the winding sand above, be aware that even if you don't find the
 blue dragon in there, it might be sitting inside one of the walls of 
the cavern, waiting to strike unsuspecting adventurers as they pass by, 
and remember that the attack might come from any direction. Of course, 
things in and around the blue dragon's lair might not seem as they 
appear -- see below.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In deep sand, blue dragons prefer hit-and-run tactics, 
where they can strike their slowed opponent and burrow away, popping up 
in a different direction. Try to stay on rocky or otherwise solid ground
 if you're facing a blue dragon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Blue dragons are capable flyers and can stay aloft for 
hours. If you're entering into blue dragon territory, always have 
someone keeping her eyes above, since the coloration on their bellies 
blends in extremely well with the blue, desert sky. Spread out and avoid
 walking in a single-file line, so as to avoid everyone from succumbing 
to the blue dragon's line-shaped breath weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Abilities</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-04%20-%20Tougher%20and%20Meaner%20Than%20You%20%28Part%202%29_files/dx0404tt_tacticstips_bluedr2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="352" width="250">Blue dragons excel at lies and deceit, and their special abilities aid them in befuddling their prey -- <i>create/destroy water, ventriloquism, hallucinatory terrain, veil</i>, and<i> mirage arcana</i>.
 Although blue dragons get most of the water they need from the blood of
 animals, they often use their special ability to make water to lure in 
prey. They can also use this ability to destroy the potions of an 
adventuring group, in addition to their precious supply of water (see 
the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060328a">previous article</a> in this series for more details on how to combat this tactic).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Blue dragons also use their sound imitation ability to 
lure in potential prey, and they prefer to do so from the safety of a 
spot into which they've burrowed. They use it to both mimic the calls of
 desert animals and the voices of any people they might overhear, in 
hopes of dividing up a group and picking them off one by one. Adult and 
older dragons combine this with <i>ventriloquism</i> to further confuse their enemies.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Older blue dragons use <i>hallucinatory terrain </i>and <i>mirage arcana</i>
 to make their lairs look completely different. They might create the 
illusion of an oasis to draw in prey or hide the entrance to their cave 
with a fake cliff wall. One of their favorite ruses is to make an 
illusion of long-forgotten ruins -- the perfect bait for adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Other Tactics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Blue dragons have the earth descriptor, so they can be 
rebuked by clerics with the Air domain, although their formidable save 
makes this an unlikely prospect. If you're planning on stalking and 
hunting down a blue dragon, set up some bait, preferably camels, horses,
 and other herd animals, to draw their attention. They are drawn 
particularly to caravans -- a double bonus of both food and treasure in 
one sitting -- so creating a trap this way could work well. However, 
blue dragons are very intelligent and it might work only on the younger 
dragons who may not have experienced such treachery and lack the 
willpower to pass up such a prize.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dealing with a Blue Dragon's Breath Weapon</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The blue dragon's breath weapon is a line of electricity
 -- avoid lining up to give the dragon a free shot! Stock up with 
spells, potions, or scrolls of <i>protection from energy</i> or <i>resist energy</i> and armor and shields of <i>electricity resistance</i>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Blue dragons fight well in flight, so do your best to keep it on the ground, using nets, <i>web</i>
 spells, and tanglefoot bags. If it does get into the air, stay close to
 your allies, but avoid getting in a line (see sidebar). Blue dragons 
excel at hit-and-run maneuvers and try to separate a group first before 
picking off individuals one by one.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you're heading into a blue dragon's territory with the intent of taking it on, make sure you have <i>true seeing</i>
 and similar spells or magic items so that you can make sure that you're
 looking at reality instead of illusion. Also make liberal use of spells
 that protect against the trials of the desert, such as <i>locate water</i>, <i>hydrate</i>, and <i>protection from desiccation</i>. Of course, a good <i>decanter of endless water</i> never hurts either!</p>
