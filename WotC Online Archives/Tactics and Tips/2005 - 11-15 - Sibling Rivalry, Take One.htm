and four levels of that and then take a paragon level and this prestige 
class and make sure I pick up a half-fiend template along the way, this <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a> will be perfect!</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy Collins:</b> Is that how you approach character 
creation when you start a new campaign? Have you built a massive menu of
 matrices to maximize your magical and melee mastery?</p>
<p align="left">Do you drive your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">Dungeon Master</a> crazy when you do it?</p>
<p align="left">Stay tuned, this column might be for you.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-15%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20One_files/dx1115tt_chain.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="348" width="204">But
 first, some introductions. I'm Andy Collins, RPG developer for Wizards 
of the Coast R&amp;D. You might remember me from such products as <i>Magic of Incarnum</i>, <i>Complete Adventurer</i>, or <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>. It turns out that when I'm not getting paid to think about <b>D&amp;D</b>,
 I'm thinking about it on my own time, and a good portion of that time 
is spent as the DM of various campaigns. With very few breaks, I've been
 running one or more campaigns since about 1981, which makes me older 
than I'd like to think about for very long. (Yes, we had dice back then.
 Well, eventually we did. Pipe down you whippersnappers!)</p>
<p align="left">In addition to an uncanny ability to cite chapter and 
verse on rules, these years of experience also give me plenty of insight
 into the trials and tribulations of DMs. For all those on the 
text-heavy side of the screen, I got your back. After all, we're already
 outnumbered by those pesky folks who take such joy in wrecking our 
perfectly created dungeon or storyline with the crazy concoctions they 
call their "characters." Yes, I'm talking about <i>players</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg Collins:</b> And since 1981, I've been doing the wrecking. I'm Greg Collins, Andy's younger, taller brother (and a producer over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magicthegathering.com/">www.magicthegathering.com</a>). That's almost a quarter-century of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 -- and even though I've killed approximately 97,356 creatures to his 
few dozen PC kills, I don't feel satisfied. I need to break him.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">But don't we know each 
other's tricks after playing together for so long? Not even close. 
That's the beauty of a good player-DM relationship, which will be an 
undercurrent to this column series. With new <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_class')">classes</a>, feats, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a>
 hitting your gaming store every month, you'll see a constant tinkering 
of the recipe for a perfect player character-- I'll try to brew up the 
sweetest revenge possible for that last TPK.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">Plus, if I had an axe to 
grind with Andy because of something he did to my character, that could 
spill out into unhealthy retributions . . . such as rubbing soap on a 
toothbrush at age 15. While that might have felt good at the time, what 
really hits the sweet spot is dreaming up that perfect character niche 
and NAILING IT.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">So how are you gonna beat my psionically <i>expanded</i> half-ogre spike-chain-wielding Combat-Reflexed tripmaster now, Mr. DM?</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> First of all, credit where it's due, pal. That was your toothbrush covered in soap, not mine.</p>
<p align="left">As far as your character build, you don't scare me. A 
big, strong character who likes to trip my precious, precious monsters? 
Any DM worth his salt has killed a half-dozen of those punks by now -- 
or are you forgetting all the deaths suffered by a certain <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Large')">Large</a> halberd-wielding <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_paladin')">paladin</a> from my last campaign?</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> No fair 
bringing up other PCs' weaknesses and throwing them in my face. I found 
my own unique ways to die, thank you very much. A <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bard')">bard</a>
 using Bluff to be animated as a zombie when the necromancer meant to 
turn me into a shadow? C'mon, that deserves a column all by itself. But 
enough reminiscing; back to the matter at hand!</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Sure, a trip is a nice little trick. A prone monster is more vulnerable to attacks from the rest of the party (-4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">AC</a> against <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee attacks</a>) and has to spend a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moveaction')">move action</a> to stand up (not only provoking <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackofopportunity')">attacks of opportunity</a>
 but also preventing it from making a full attack, which only becomes 
more costly at higher levels). But here's a handful of countering 
tactics that, as your DM, I'd keep ready to spring on your tripmaster.</p>
<p align="left"><b>1. The Bigger, Stronger Monster.</b> Your big half-ogre is strong, sure, but my CR 4 brown bear's just as big and he's stronger. Or maybe you'd like to meet Mr. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Huge')">Huge</a> Monstrous Centipede -- a mere CR 2, this bad boy opposes your trip check with a whopping +15 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> (3 for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> 17, 8 for Huge, and 4 for having way-more-than-two legs). Huge, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Gargantuan')">Gargantuan</a>, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Colossal')">Colossal</a> vermin come pretty cheap, as far as CR goes, making them easy to use even at relatively low levels.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-15%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20One_files/dx1115tt_vine.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="261" width="219"><b>2. The Untrippable Foe.</b> Sure, the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 doesn't specifically say that tripping a gray ooze is impossible, but 
that's one of those no-brainers the game expects the DM and players to 
pick up on their own. Same for flyers -- what good does it do to knock a
 flying ogre mage's legs out from under it? No good, that's what. And 
don't get me started on incorporeal critters. Just a glance through the 
low CRs in the <i>Monster Manual</i> gives me a bunch of monsters I'd 
consider effectively "untrippable": air elemental, allip, arrowhawk, 
assassin vine (need I remind your dead gnoll barbarian Ulveg how 
effective those are against puny PCs?), cloaker, dire bat, giant eagle, 
giant wasp, gibbering mouther, ochre jelly, shadow, snake, spider eater,
 stirge, any swarm, wraith . . . the list goes on and on. (And for those
 high-level tripmasters, you'll be meeting my good friend the beholder 
soon enough.)</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> It should be 
clarified that Ulveg's last breath came when his rage ran out as he was 
crawling away from the assassin vine, not due to any direct damage 
inflicted by said vine. Barrister, you may continue.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>3. Monsters Who Don't Much Care.</b> This is related to #2, but includes monsters that, even if they can be tripped, are perfectly effective when <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_prone')">prone</a>.
 To a monster with an already low AC, the -4 penalty is meaningless. The
 same is true for a monster with a higher-than-normal attack <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_modifier')">modifier</a> (such as a giant), or a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_touchattack')">touch attack</a> (can you say rust monster?), or better yet a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_grapplecheck')">grapple check</a>
 (there's no penalty on grapple checks when prone, bunky) -- it's still 
quite capable of kicking your character's ass while sitting on its own. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_breathweapon')">Breath weapons</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_gaze')">gaze</a> attacks work just fine from the ground, thank you, so my prone medusa or gorgon can still make your lives miserable.</p>
<p align="left"><b>4. Monsters You Don't Want to Touch.</b> Go ahead, 
use your spiked chain to trip my babau. I double-dog-dare you. You 
better believe I'll be keeping track of how much damage its protective 
slime deals to your precious weapon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>5. Monsters Who Can Take It Away:</b> This is 
something like #4, except that I'm the one in charge of deciding when 
your weapon goes poof. The rust monster's the obvious one, but remember I
 can optimize too -- my Power-Attacking, Improved-Sundering frost giant 
barbarian or my Improved-Disarming swashbuckler can turn your one-trick 
pony into a, well, no-trick donkey.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> You raise two 
important issues. The first is how players should expect a good DM to 
throw all sorts of challenges at his PCs, and the best characters are 
the ones prepared to face 'em all. Dreaming up the perfect character 
doesn't go very far if you can't think on your feet to overcome the 
challenge that negates your strengths.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">But even "negating a 
strength" can go too far if the DM becomes vindictive. Fighting an 
occasional weapon sunderer or acid-based blob of glup is enough to keep 
players on their toes (and packing backup weapons). Fighting them 
constantly because that's how a DM decided to even the playing field is 
not only dirty pool, but it'll also lead to very disgruntled players.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">A player bearing a grudge 
against a key villain can be vital to storyline immersion, but the DM 
should never carry a grudge against a character who occasionally foils 
the best-laid plans of the brain behind the screen. The good DM knows to
 pick times to play to his characters' strengths, too, which lets that 
machine of perfection churn through enemies to the delight of a player.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> That's entirely correct. "Moderation in all
 things" is just as appropriate in DMing as it is in life. If any given 
player complains from time to time about not contributing to a fight, 
you're probably doing a good job. It's only when the entire party is 
complaining in unison (or when one player constantly complains) that you
 may have a problem -- either with your encounters or with your players.</p>
<p align="left">I love throwing a horde of charging minions at a big 
tripmaster. The look on the player's face as he takes out three or four 
before they even get within striking distance is priceless; I know he'll
 remember that encounter for months. And I know that I didn't expect 
those minions to survive anyway -- they just bought a round or two for 
the master villain to put his plan in action.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> So how does my
 chain-wielding goon deal with some of those exotic threats? He turns to
 his trusted party. You're not in this alone, so don't make it harder by
 hanging out with three other exotic weapon masters impressing each 
other with your fancy tricks. For every rust monster that makes my guy 
cry like he's back in itty-bitty ogre diapers, there's an SR-toting mind
 flayer looking to feast on my wizard buddy's juicy spell-soaked brain. 
Lemme at him and he'll wish he was 100 percent octopus, instead of that 
trippable biped using his legs like a sucker.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Remember, the players are ultimately <b>supposed</b>
 to be victorious. The game's designed to give them an edge. It's no 
challenge for the DM to kill off the whole party -- the challenge is in 
creating encounters that are just tough enough to put a scare into the 
PCs without actually killing them all off.</p>
<p align="left">We hope this column has helped some DMs think about how 
to deal with the perfect character in their campaigns. Tune in next 
month, when you're likely to hear even more stories about how I've 
killed Greg's characters. </p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> And how each one came back, better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster . . .</span></p>
