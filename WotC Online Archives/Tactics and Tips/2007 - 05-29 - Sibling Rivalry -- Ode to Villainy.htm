 and then froze us at the bottom of the river? What was up with that? 
Even when the players who weren't there that session brought their guys 
in to the rescue, they got popped. We had to go to the equivalent of 
Gamma Flight to finally beat that thing. That went from a throwaway 
adventure to one of the most memorable encounters in no time flat.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Do your players engage in this sort of conversation from
 time to time? If not, you might be selling your villains short. Let's 
see what our gaming brothers have to say about memorable villainy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> By the time I was in high school I'd run many campaigns, both short and long, and hundreds upon hundreds of encounters. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But ask any of my veteran players which encounter from 
the old days they remember most and they're likely to describe a 
particularly nasty encounter with an <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psb/20030124b">obsidian dragon</a>
 named Nightfall. What started out as a simple dragon hunt took a 
decidedly unorthodox turn when the characters' prey turned out to be a 
lot cannier than they expected.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The adventure, inspired in part by the instant classic "Into the Flames" from issue #1 of <i>Dungeon Adventures</i>
 magazine, featured a very powerful, very intelligent dragon in a lair 
built to maximize his abilities. Traps, scrying sensors, peepholes, 
secret passages -- this dragon was good and ready for a pack of pesky 
PCs to poke around.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Our party was
 pretty high level by then . . . my guess would be at least 12th, but 
the exact details are a little fuzzy. We'd taken down slavers and giant 
kings and forces of elemental evil . . . even though we knew a dragon 
was in that cave somewhere, we weren't worried. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">I do recall using one of our tried-and-true methods of entry: <i>stone shape</i> a narrow entry point, everybody piles into the <i>portable hole</i>, a wild-shaped druid carries it through the hole, and then we find a safe place to unload before laying the down the hurt. (<i>Stone shape</i> also was great guns during <i>D3: Vault of the Drow</i> -- we'd go to the roof of a clan house, <i>stone shape</i> a peephole, look in to see if it opened into the main chamber, and then start pumping charges from our <i>wand of steam and vapor</i> in there. Mmmm, who wants steamed elf?)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">But this time, we weren't so lucky.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Somewhere along the line I read advice on 
how to play a villain smarter than me, which basically said, "Pretend 
that he can guess what the PCs are going to do next." In this case, that
 meant that he was waiting at the other side of the tiny <i>stone-shaped</i>
 tunnel with a powerful enchantment spell. I took Scott (the player of 
the druid) aside and watched as he failed his saving throw against 
spells. Calmly, the dragon took the <i>portable hole</i> from the 
ensorcelled druid and carried it to the bottom of the icy river running 
through his cave. (I don't remember exactly what happened to the druid. 
Maybe Nightfall ate him first.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then I went back to the rest of the players and described how, after a longer than expected wait, the <i>portable hole</i>
 opened up . . . and a frigid waterfall fell on their heads. Before they
 could react, the dragon's icy breath had frozen the entire contents of 
the <i>portable hole</i> into a single cylindrical block of ice (this tale was mentioned in the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/pod/20070511e10">Episode 10 podcast</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Like I said, 
we had faced many daunting foes before. But this was the first taste of 
total annihilation . . . it didn't sit well. This was 2nd Edition, and I
 still felt very attached to my lovingly crafted halfling 
druid/thief-acrobat. What in the world were we supposed to do?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Luckily, a couple of our 
players weren't there that session, so we scrambled next session to put 
together a back-up group of leftover PCs and prominent NPC cohorts and 
allies. When that attack failed, we were down to the bottom of the 
barrel, but we finally overwhelmed Nightfall with sheer numbers. The 
dragon certainly wasn't your typical recurring villain, but it left a 
powerful mark.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Nightfall wasn't designed as a long-term 
or even necessarily memorable villain, but circumstances conspired to 
fix him in the memories of the players for the last two decades.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One of the earliest NPCs to become a recurring thorn in the side of the characters appeared in my <b>Planescape </b>
 campaign some years later. Most of the characters were either new to 
Sigil or simple outcasts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they quickly fell in 
with an unsavory element: the seedy underbelly of planar society. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Specifically, they stumbled upon that staple of late-night martial arts movies: a bloodsport arena.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b><img src="2007%20-%2005-29%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20Ode%20to%20Villainy_files/suleidan.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="184" width="173">Greg: </b> If you're a <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20070227a">regular reader of this series</a> , you already know about <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20010730a">Suleidan Kithkani</a>
 . He owned Dawthdun the minotaur gladiator (played by our friend 
Kevin), and he was pretty fair with a cutlass as well. When in doubt, 
the party liked to mix it up in the ring.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">After several successful 
fights, Suleidan developed a rivalry with a wealthy rug merchant (whose 
name, sadly, has been lost in the sands of time). Some petty insults, a 
bit of gladiator thievery, and other hijinks went on over the course of 
several sessions.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Finally (and foolishly), 
Suleidan would have no more and challenged the merchant to set up a 
fight -- any fight -- against the PCs. We were 5th level, and what he 
threw at us would probably be an EL 10 encounter had this been 3rd 
Edition. The upside? I got us 10:1 odds and put 5,000 gp on the good 
guys. And you know what? We won.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">And then skipped town.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> This was one of those times we DMs love: 
when a variety of unconnected events come together to inspire a 
memorable storyline. I'd actually written up the bloodsport arena (and 
most of its gladiators) for a<i></i><b>Dark Sun </b> game I'd run a few 
years earlier in college. When the characters were looking for some 
trouble to get into, I pulled out my notes and let them get a little 
bloody and win some gold. The activity proved so popular with the 
players that the arena became a recurring site . . . and the NPCs 
affiliated with it, including this merchant/gladiator owner, became 
recurring characters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The rivalry didn't take much work to establish -- just 
show a little disrespect to my players' characters and the rest 
virtually writes itself. And when he suddenly owed the PCs a cool 50 
grand that he couldn't fork over, escape from the city was the obvious 
trick that'd really peeve them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Since we were
 in Sigil, "escape from the city" meant he could have gone anywhere. We 
knew we weren't going to find him right away, so we put it on the 
backburner while earnestly vowing to track him to the ends of the 
multiverse.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> The PCs didn't get entirely shafted. They 
took over their rival's storefront, which gave them a steady (if paltry)
 income. What's more, it gave them a reason to stick around and set down
 roots. Next thing you know, they're living in a manor and running a 
thriving mercenary business.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That's a long way from battling sweaty barbarians on a 
blood-slicked floor while a crowd of lowlifes and the occasional demon 
or devil are screaming for your head on a pike. ("So, Jimmy, do you like
 gladiator movies?")</p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, the PCs eventually caught up with the 
welcher. Months later, they tracked him down on a distant world and 
collected on their bet by putting him to work for them. </p>
<p align="LEFT">That brings up a really important point for DMs: A sense
 of closure is extremely important for players. There's little that's 
more frustrating than knowing that the bad guys got away from you, and 
almost nothing better than making them pay for their evil deeds 
(including the gall of escaping you in the first place). Almost every 
unsatisfactory gaming experience I can remember (both as a player and 
DM) was at least in part due to the knowledge that the villains had 
thwarted the PCs and that the players couldn't see how they'd get even.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><img src="2007%20-%2005-29%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20Ode%20to%20Villainy_files/dx20070529_siblingrivalry_rakshasa.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="314" width="240"><b>Greg: </b>
 Speaking of getting even . . . having been on the receiving end of 
twenty years of Andy's villains, I welcomed the chance to make my own. 
When I started planning my Island campaign, I wanted to have a key 
villain. I'd already decided there would be a strong "false identity" 
theme, so I made a list of all the monsters with the shapeshifter type. 
(Ironically, I threw out hengeyokai even though it was an Asian-themed 
world.) It turned out to be a different Eastern mythology that provided 
my villain: the rakshasa. But not your run-of-the-mill backward-hands 
tiger man . . . I went with the ak'chazar version from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179210000">Monster Manual III</a></i>. Since this was a city-based campaign, I clearly needed a crime lord, and a necromantic shapeshifter mastermind fit the bill.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Knowing that Ishinomori 
would be my ultimate figure of evil, I then set out to craft a world 
where it wasn't obvious he was the only bad guy. Long before the PCs 
even knew of a dark figure named Ishinomori, they encountered the 
Almighty Ayabito, another crime boss. He had the PCs run a few missions 
(of questionable ethics) for him, but never made them perform outright 
evil acts (he didn't want to lose them as powerful agents). But because 
the PCs were introduced to him as a figure from organized crime, they 
never quite knew if he was just bad, or truly evil.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> And some of us didn't really care. We just wanted the gold.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Ishinomori 
even used this knowledge to his advantage, setting up a meeting with the
 PCs at the Almighty Ayabito's regular restaurant, disguised as the 
Ayabito himself. When Lotus Blossom started asking questions the 
rakshasa didn't know the answer to -- and Nat Mason subsequently flipped
 a table trying to start a fight -- Ishinomori knew it was time to 
reveal at least some of his power. Out came the pain wave, everybody 
took 20-some-odd points of damage, and then he teleported away. At which
 point the characters finally had an idea of what type of villain they 
were facing.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Well, some of us did. Others were too 
confused and just assumed everybody was a bad guy . . . a tactic which 
often paid off for good ol' Nat Mason, my barbarian-turned-drunken 
master.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Like that time you punched an old woman <i>who just happened to be a polymorphed night hag.</i> Grrrr. . . .</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Nat Mason = <i>Super. Genius</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> When the 
threads of Ishinomori's master plan led the PCs through a fake 
crematorium to an abandoned, remote sanitarium-turned-undead factory to a
 storage house filled with zombies on the property of a major Island 
political power, they had their suspicions confirmed. Ishinomori had 
usurped a spot on the governing council AND threatened to unleash his 
zombie horde on the unsuspecting Island!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Which, we concluded, made him the bad guy.
 Good enough for me! One super-powerful shapeshifting magic-wielding 
crime boss, marked for a takedown.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But as far as long-term villainy goes, I think our high point was during my <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Bloodlines/Bloodlines.htm&amp;origin=dnd_tt_20070529a">Bloodlines campaign</a> In many ways, Bloodlines marks my personal high-water mark in <b>D&amp;D </b>
 campaigns -- never before or since have I threaded together so many 
storylines, characters, and original content into a single campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And perhaps the most significant thread in that campaign
 involved a group of archvillains who would, over the course of multiple
 years of play, dip their fingers into just about every kind of evil. 
Kidnapping, pillaging, heresy, treason, murder, slavery . . . you name 
it, these guys were into it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Right from the start, I'd sketched out a general plan 
for this group. Mayhem and looting paid the bills, but they had big 
plans to unfold, and equally big grudges to settle with some of the 
folks the PCs trusted most.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As the campaign unfolded, the characters slowly gained 
awareness of the villainy that lay in wait. A simple kidnapping case 
provided the clue that something larger was afoot. Soon enough, a 
full-fledged slave ring (thought dead for a generation) had returned to 
the region. The heroes put this new group down, and even took out a 
couple of the masterminds, but three key figures -- the barbarian 
warlord Woldemar Skell, the mysterious blackguard Conallsson, and the 
sorcerer-lich Strabo -- eluded discovery. (I tempered that particular 
sense of loss by letting the PCs catch up with the vile kidnapper who'd 
started them on the case months earlier. See, closure!)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Our research 
into the slaver ring made us first think it was a copycat group, or at 
least the remnants of the once-feared Scarlet Sails. Legend said the 
leaders of that group -- including a sorcerer named Strabo, now 
apparently a lich -- had been killed a generation ago. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> For the rest of the campaign, the shadows 
of that plot continued to plague the heroes. Even as the PCs found ways 
to thwart the plans of the remaining villains, at other times they 
became unwitting pawns of their worst enemies. They rescued the missing 
duke's younger son from Woldemar Skell . . . but only because Strabo had
 possessed the addled young man and wanted to spy on the royal court. 
They quelled strife between human and elven villages . . . but couldn't 
repair the political firestorm that destroyed a centuries-old alliance 
between the two races. They helped fight off a goblinoid invasion, but 
their absence from the city gave the villains the opportunity to get the
 duke's elder son exiled from the kingdom. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> We just thought we had bad timing.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> When it came time to replace the local 
bishop, the PCs threw their weight on the side of longtime ally Lorcan .
 . . unwittingly putting one of their greatest enemies in charge of the 
province's religious well-being. Even when they finally caught the 
wizard responsible for the human-elven strife (himself another unwitting
 pawn of the villains), they still couldn't prevent him from murdering 
the duke . . . which put Strabo on the throne in a time of near-war with
 the elves.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> Strabo and Lorcan were classic <b>D&amp;D </b>
 villains. At first we didn't know who they were, then we couldn't 
believe they actually existed, then we realized how powerful they were, 
and <i>then</i> we confronted them one at a time. Skell went down 
without much of a fight. When Lorcan, now bishop of the Western 
Province, revealed himself to be Conallsson (son of the blackguard 
Conall, one of the original slave lords), our deep faith in the church 
of Altius was shaken. When we finally determined Strabo was a 
body-hopping lich, we all but threw up our hands -- how do you kill 
something that can't be contained in one body?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> The hunt for Strabo was actually one of 
the weakest points of the campaign. I'd unintentionally created a 
villain that the PCs couldn't beat, because they couldn't track him 
down. I hadn't been thinking far enough ahead of the plot, and when I 
ad-libbed the investigation, the PCs went down way too many dead ends. 
In hindsight, I should've spent more effort creating a "plot tree" for 
these sessions to ensure that the PCs -- and more importantly, the 
players -- could keep moving forward.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b> After lengthy investigations and several encounters with Strabo-possessed entities, we finally "killed" him. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Of course, he'd hidden his 
phylactery so well that his death was only temporary. He messed with us 
for another couple of weeks before we truly put him down and declared 
the threat finally over. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Can I just point out that one of the clues
 that led them to Strabo was the rotting corpse of a kidnapped woman 
that the lich had turned into a zombie for his own, um, personal needs? 
(Hey, you try being a lich who's suddenly in a living body for way 
longer than your fragile mental health can take and see what happens to 
you!) And that when the PCs finally busted down the door to his royal 
apartment, they also found a closet full of similar victims?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>All together now: Ewwwwww!</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">(Honestly, I'm not really that guy. I don't remember 
exactly what inspired such a repugnant scene, but there's a good chance 
that <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881610000">Book of Vile Darkness</a></i> helped.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Anyway, by the time the PCs took down the last of the 
former slave lords (for the second and last time), they'd gained 
probably 15 levels since uncovering the first clue, and the end of the 
campaign was in sight. But even those final few sessions held echoes of 
the villains' plots and machinations, including a rock-'em, sock-'em 
no-holds-barred finale against the serpent god whose machinations had 
been driving most of the evil plots in the campaign, including those of 
the villains themselves! </p>
<p align="LEFT">As readers of my website probably know, <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.andycollins.net/Theories/villainy.htm&amp;origin=dnd_tt_20070529a">I'm a big fan of villains</a>. Fact is, they're often more interesting than the heroes who inevitably defeat them. If you're running a <b>D&amp;D </b>
 game, you owe your heroes some memorable villains. Pull out all the 
stops, and don't hesitate to cheat. Hey, they wouldn't call 'em villains
 if they played by the rules!</p>
