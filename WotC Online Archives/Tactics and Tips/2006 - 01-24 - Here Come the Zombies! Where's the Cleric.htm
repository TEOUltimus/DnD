In addition to their role as the party's main source of healing, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cleric')">clerics</a> are the first line of defense against the predations of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_undeadtype')">undead</a>.
 But what happens if your group lacks a cleric or he is incapable of 
helping out during a fight with these foul creatures? This week, we look
 at ways to combat undead without the benefit of a cleric at your side.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What Are Your Class Options?</b></p>
<p align="left"> Okay, so you don't have a cleric in your group, or he 
has been knocked out/captured/possessed by the evil monster. What's your
 group to do? First off, take a look at what classes your group already 
possesses. Every class has certain skills, talents, and abilities to 
face different types of undead. Of course, if you don't have a cleric, 
everyone should take advantage of some of the following potions and 
scrolls<i>: cure </i>spells (since you'll lack healers), <i>magic circle against evil</i> (to hedge out undead), <i>remove disease, remove paralysis</i> (against ghouls and ghasts), and <i>lesser restoration/restoration</i> (to heal inevitable <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydamage')">ability damage</a>).</p>

<p align="left"><b>The Paladin:</b> If your cleric is out of commission,
 having a paladin is the next best thing. The biggest concern is her 
level -- a paladin cannot lay on hands until 2nd level and cannot <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_turnundead')">turn undead</a> until 4th level. However, her <i>detect evil</i>
 ability helps her locate most undead ahead of time and smite evil works
 just as effectively on almost all undead as it does on other creature 
types. <i>Remove disease</i> is particularly handy when you're facing ghouls and other pestilence-spreading undead.</p>
<p align="left">Where your paladin should be in the combat depends on 
the mix of your group. If you're already heavy on fighters, monks, and 
barbarians, keep the paladin to the rear where she can use her spells, 
turn undead, and lay on hands abilities to the most effective use, 
letting the others do the most <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_melee')">melee</a>
 damage. If you have more spellcasters, rogues, and other support types 
in your group, the paladin should be in the front line, hopefully 
bolstered by spells and first using her turn undead effects to take out 
many combatants early.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT">In addition to the following class options, you might also consider investing in the following magic items:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Bead of Force</i>,<i> Ring of Force Shield/Protection</i>: Useful against <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_incorporealsubtype')">incorporeal creatures</a>. For more on fighting incorporeal creatures, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060103a">consult here</a>.</p>

<p align="left"><i>Armor of Undead Controlling:</i> This item is costly!</p>

<p align="left">Although limited in number, the paladin does possess several spells that are designed for dealing with undead: <i>daylight,
 death ward, detect undead, dispel chaos/evil, lesser restoration, 
protection from chaos/evil, remove paralysis, magic circle against 
chaos/evil, </i>and<i> restoration</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Sorcerer and Wizard: </b>Obviously, the best way 
for sorcerers and wizards to tackle undead is to blow them away with a 
variety of offensive spells or bolster allies with defensive spells such
 as <i>mage armor</i> (see the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060103a">Incorporeal Creatures article</a> for more on this). Don't bother with mind-affecting effects or spells that have a Fortitude save. Most undead have poor <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Reflexsave')">Reflex saves</a>, so spells that hinder movement, such as <i>animate rope</i>, <i>fog cloud</i>, <i>solid fog</i>, and <i>web</i>, can stop them in their tracks. Boost your paladin's Charisma score with <i>eagle's splendor</i> to raise her Charisma, and thus her turn undead ability. Sorcerers and wizards also have several spells from the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_necromancy')">necromancy</a> school that can directly affect undead: <i>command undead, control undead, disrupt undead, halt undead, </i>and <i>undeath to death</i>.
 If you know you're going to fight undead, and you haven't chosen 
necromancy as your prohibited school if you're a specialized wizard, 
choose these to help in the fight.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Druid:</b> If the druid is the sole divine 
spellcaster in the group, she's the healer by default when fighting 
undead (and, one of the few classes to have Heal as a class <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skill')">skill</a>). Have her stick to the rear of the group and cast <i>cure</i>
 spells and other defensive spells to bolster the group. Also, have her 
order her animal companion to harry undead opponents or keep it to her 
back to keep her from being susceptible to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flankattacks.')">flank attacks.</a></p>
<p align="left"><b>The Bard: </b><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bard')">Bards</a> can cast <i>cure</i>
 spells, so he is another one of the healers in the group. Most bard 
abilities don't work on undead, who are immune to mind-affecting 
effects. Use his spells to augment the group and have him stick to the 
rear to pelt undead with ranged attacks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Ranger:</b> The only particular advantage a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ranger')">ranger</a>
 can gain against an undead is if he chooses that creature type as his 
chosen enemy. Otherwise, the ranger should take the fight directly to 
the undead, using his animal companion to keep his back safe from 
flanking attacks. The ranger has almost no spells that specifically help
 against undead, but <i>entangle</i> can help bog down corporeal undead if you're in the right terrain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Fighter and Barbarian:</b> If you face undead, 
make sure that the fighters and barbarians in your group get the benefit
 of spells and effects that boost their Will save, such as <i>owl's wisdom </i>(to boost Wisdom) if you're fighting incorporeal dead. Also, <i>bear's endurance</i>
 can augment their already sturdy Constitution scores to reduce the 
chance of them succumbing to failed Fortitude saves from undead, such as
 bodaks, ghouls, ghasts, mohrgs, liches, and wights. Be prepared to swap
 their swords for maces when fighting skeletons.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Monk:</b> The monk is at major disadvantage when facing undead. Her most effective attack, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_unarmedstrike')">unarmed strike</a>,
 comes with great risk against most undead, which have devastating melee
 attacks themselves. A monk has little to fear against zombies and 
skeletons (other than regular damage), but she should avoid getting 
close to wraiths and other incorporeal undead -- stick to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attacks</a>, if possible, and have her protect the spellcasters from flank attacks!</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Rogue:</b> Rogues have it the hardest when facing
 undead, since their key ability, sneak attack, does not function 
against these types of creatures. They should remain in the rear and use
 ranged attacks against undead foes, focusing on flanking, if possible. 
Otherwise, a rogue should stay clear of melee attacks.</p>
