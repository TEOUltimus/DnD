<p align="LEFT">But while these encounters are often the most 
entertaining, they're also the most likely to garner the ultimate 
negative result: the total party kill (or TPK if, like "The Dude," 
brevity is your thing). Even though the DM may not have overestimated 
his characters' abilities, if the players don't recognize the threat in a
 timely manner, the fight may get a lot uglier than intended.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sure, an occasional PC biting the dust isn't the end of 
the world -- and may in fact make the encounter more memorable -- but 
ultimately, <b>D&amp;D</b> is a game that the players are supposed to 
win. When they don't, you're not only left with disappointed (and 
surprised) players, but also with a potentially wrecked campaign (and 
maybe even lost friends).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In an effort to help you avoid that calamity, we'll 
perform a post-mortem examination of a botched "boss monster" encounter 
from my own campaign, talking about how both the DM and the players 
might have improved the experience, as well as how we turned the 
near-TPK into a positive (and interesting) part of the campaign's story 
arc.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now if only I could think of such an encounter . . .</p>
<p class="" align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b><img src="2006%20-%2004-18%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Four_files/dx0418tt_tacticstips_forge.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="277" width="240">Greg:</b>
 The skies were angry that day, my friend. We had gathered to finish 
cleaning out the forge underneath Helmsport, when the multitude of 
passageways and rivulets met up into a larger passage that beckoned our 
attention.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">The room beyond was large, 
we could tell that. But darkness stretched out farther than our light 
sources could pierce. We started scrambling along a 10-foot wide 
"beach," not wanting to venture into murky waters that probably held the
 sewage run-off of the entire city.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Then we heard a voice. Or 
maybe there wasn't a voice, just a stinging cone of acid (players don't 
like to remember the low points of their careers). We were ambushed, 
spread thin along the edge of the room with little mobility.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">The black dragon was upon us.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Man, elephants have nothing on the memories of shafted players. That was what, five years ago?</p>
<p align="LEFT">The encounter Greg has dredged up from the depths of the past was based on room 52 from <i>Forge of Fury</i>, the second in <b>D&amp;D</b>'s
 series of "Adventure Path" modules from early 3rd Edition. Since the 
PCs had advanced well beyond the intended levels of the adventure, I 
bumped up Nightscale from young (then CR 4, adjusted to CR 5 in version 
3.5 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>) to a CR 9 or 10. As I remember, the 
characters were all 7th or 8th level, so this seemed like a reasonable 
challenge for a "boss" encounter. It'd be tough, but winnable, right?</p>
<p align="LEFT">As it turns out, not so much.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Yeah, not so 
much. We were a confident group of experienced players who worked pretty
 well together. But we failed to realize how much geography has to do 
with success on the battlefield. The element of surprise belonged to the
 dragon, sure. But after a round, things should even out . . . it's not 
like it's getting two turns to our one for very long. What really honked
 us good was the underground lake the beast had made into its lair.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Our line got stretched, and
 the far flank was compromised when Alarion the paladin was caught in 
base-to-base contact with the dragon. Even though he was the most 
powerful character in the party, he was no match.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Then Seth the wizard 
disappeared, caught on the wrong side of the room. The rest of us could 
see the writing (in blood and itty-bitty Alarion bits) on the wall -- 
time to cut and run.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT">(For a synopsis of how this encounter played out in real life, <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Bloodlines/11_return_khundrukar.htm&amp;origin=dnd_tt_20060418a">check it out</a>)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">We were bushwhacked -- a 
promising day of adventuring ripped apart like so many paladin victuals.
 Where did we go wrong? Did we miss a sign that said you had to be at 
least this tall to enter the room? Sure, a giant pile of bones by the 
edge of the water might have tipped us off not to go too deep into the 
chamber. But this dragon was on us like a bulldog on a pork chop.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Did we have any acid 
protection available? Not with the cleric absent, and the rogue/wizard 
focusing more on stealth and summoning than buffing his allies. <i>Water breathing</i>?
 Nobody prepares that for a spur-of-the-moment casting. Once you know 
you're going pearl-diving, you break out the calculator, start dividing 
the duration among your party, and figure out how many third-level spell
 slots need to be committed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-18%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Four_files/dx0418tt_tacticstips_dragon.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="343" width="150"><b>Andy: </b>In
 hindsight, I can see that the room's layout could hardly have been 
designed better for a savvy black dragon . . . or worse for a group of 
unprepared PCs. Though the watery environment was hardly a surprise -- 
they'd been wading through rivers for a couple of sessions -- most 
characters will go to almost any length to avoid shelling out 
hard-earned gold for items that will help them deal with environmental 
hazards. Scrolls and <i>potions of</i><i>water breathing</i> or <i>water walk</i> are pretty easy to come by, but they always seem to fall to the bottom of the to-do list.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even more importantly, there weren't enough clues as to 
the level of risk that faced the PCs. While it's reasonable for any 
party to be careful when walking along a slimy ledge above a dark 
subterranean lake, you're not necessarily thinking that the lake hides 
the toughest monster you're going to face in the entire dungeon. They 
had no reason to prep themselves against a black dragon's strengths 
(acid breath weapon, high Armor Class, great mobility, and stealth).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Perhaps worst of all, though, was that in order to fight
 the dragon, the PCs had to put themselves into positions that virtually
 eliminated any reasonable chance of teamwork. After all, once you've 
been conveniently lined up for that breath weapon, the last thing you're
 going to do is stick together. Since you don't want to give the dragon 
time to plan between attacks, you feel compelled to fight it on its own 
terms . . . that is, in the water. And believe me, there's nothing 
sadder than watching a spindly little spellcaster dog-paddle through a 
pitch-black lake while he wonders when the dragon's gonna drag him 
under, <i>Jaws</i>-style.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But all that's meaningless now -- the encounter was 
over, and I had to deal with a bunch of players whose attitudes ranged 
from frustrated to morose to outright angry.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> We were angry 
for getting whipped so badly. We were sad that Alarion was dead. We felt
 guilty for leaving Seth behind. Revenge was in order. But could we risk
 it?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">That's a silly question. Of
 course we could. We hadn't fought a dragon of this size before, so 
naturally we were overwhelmed. How do we hit it? What if it catches us 
all in its breath again? A return-trip TPK wasn't nearly the risk once 
we did research and a bit of scrying.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Preparation's a topic for 
another day, though. This time, we're focusing on what happened the 
first go at it. We failed, somewhere between "tragically" and 
"spectacularly" on the spectrum of failure. Creatures of habit, players 
need to be shaken up once in awhile ('cause, you know, growth is good 
and all that). The dragon shook us up, but it also gave us a very 
personal goal to follow. Loot's nice, but who can remember where they 
got that <i>cloak of Charisma +2</i> back in the day? Give me motivation. And it's hard to beat revenge as a reason to get up out of bed in the morning.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b>All that made for a very "motivated" group 
of players the next time we gathered around the table. Perhaps as 
expected, the battle proved as one-sided as it had before, but with the 
opposite result.</p>
<p align="LEFT">(<a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Bloodlines/12_friend_departs.htm&amp;origin=dnd_tt_20060418a">Read about it here</a>)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Thanks, <i>lower water</i>!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> More important than mere victory, though, 
was that by kicking the dragon to the curb, the players turned what 
could have been a hugely negative moment -- one that, in a group less 
tightly knit than ours, might have created lasting damage to the 
campaign -- into one of the crowning achievements of the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">And, as it turned out, the encounter also provided one 
of the players with an excellent opportunity to change characters. No, 
not the player of the dead paladin (he was already on his second 
character of the campaign), but rather the player of Seth,the 
rogue/wizard. Longing to play a pure spellcaster (rather than a 
multiclassed character), the player saw the debacle as the perfect point
 in the story for the troubled Seth to "disappear" and be replaced by a 
more traditional arcanist. Not only did this result in a happier player,
 but it also introduced some lingering story elements that would 
continue to play out for the remainder of the campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As a DM, one of the best lessons I learned from this 
encounter was to make sure that every encounter (particularly the really
 tough ones) have an "out" for the players. In most cases, the out is 
just a path of retreat, but in some cases it might be a good reason for 
the villains to keep unconscious or captured PCs alive. In the dragon's 
case, I decided that the fast-talking Seth wouldn't have too much 
difficulty convincing the dragon that his stories of the surface world 
were worth a few days of extended lifespan.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Regardless, the out should not only be recognized easily
 by the PCs, but they should also know when to take it before it's too 
late. If the only escape is a secret door, they might not even know it's
 there, but just as bad is the encounter that ends before the PCs even 
know they're outmatched. With Nightscale, I got a bit lucky on the 
second point -- the dragon preferred to attack only when its breath 
weapon was available, which gave the party a round or two to gauge the 
encounter's difficulty between assaults, and it wasn't interested in 
chasing them down the hall as they fled.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That brings up another good tip: Don't punish PCs for 
fleeing when they should. If players don't see an upside to running away
 -- whether that's because the monsters just chase 'em down and kill 'em
 anyway, or because the monsters always pack up their loot and leave 
before the PCs return -- they'll quickly learn to fight until the bitter
 end because hey, why not? You've already embarrassed the players by 
"winning" the encounter, so there's no reason to rub their noses in it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Fleeing might 
be the hardest thing for a character to do. Where's the heroism in that?
 But learn the lesson before it's too late. Players, talk out a basic 
escape plan ("Quin, you're responsible for Jarvis . . . Thorgrimm, you 
watch out for Duran") and don't be afraid to use it. Hoping for that 
natural 20/max damage critical won't save you. Good planning -- and a 
little humility -- will.</span></p>
