<p align="LEFT">The Astral Plane. The Elemental Plane of Fire. The Nine 
Hells of Baator. The various planes of existence have a long tradition 
in <b>D&amp;D</b>: a tradition of grandeur, of mystery, of opportunity ... and in the minds of many players, of sheer terror. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2006-27%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Alternate%20Planes_files/dx0627tt_tacticstips_planes2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="450" width="225">Unfortunate?
 Sure -- the planes offer a lot of neat environments to explore. 
Unreasonable? Not so much. After all, many players' first introduction 
to the concept of "the planes" comes in the form of horrifically 
powerful monsters trying to kill them. When all you know about the 
Astral Plane is that githyanki live there, it's understandable that you 
wouldn't be too excited to visit.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So what do players do when the DM announces that the 
adventure is headed "off the beaten path," as it were? Let's see what 
our siblings have to say on the matter...</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT"><i>Andy: </i>You've defeated the fire giant army and 
followed the trail of the mysterious dark elves through the underdark. 
You've overcome hordes of savage trolls, squadrons of murderous 
kuo-toas, and the occasional mind flayer or purple worm on your way to 
the drow city of Erelhei-Cinlu. You've cut a swathe through the dark elf
 cultists only to discover a greater power behind the drow's surface 
invasion. In order to tackle that greater power directly, you'll be 
stepping through a portal leading to the 66th layer of the Abyss -- the 
Demonweb of Lolth, Queen of Spiders. Everybody ready?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Greg:</i> Demon-where? 
Queen of the what? No way, no how. This body was born on the Material 
Plane, and that's where it's going to die. I ain't going to no Outer 
Plane, Hannibal!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">... is how your gaming group might respond. Or <i>should</i>
 respond, when you think about it. For many players (especially the 
old-school ones), your first glimpse of planar life was from the <i>Monster Manual</i> -- the D's, to be precise. They go up to Type VI? And what does that Ruby Rod do again?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">But it doesn't need to be 
the end of the world, even though that's often what it seems like you're
 trying to stop when you set foot in the Lower Planes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Andy:</i> As a DM, it's easy to forget how possessive
 players are of their characters and even easier to forget how fragile 
those characters seem when the players aren't sure what's going on. The 
DM has near-perfect information as to what's coming -- he knows how 
tough the monsters in the next room are, what tactics the characters 
will need to defeat the mastermind at the end of the adventure, and so 
on. </p>
<p align="LEFT">On the other hand, under-informed players always expect 
the worst possible scenario, which is a natural survival instinct. After
 all, it doesn't do much good to prepare for the third-worst 
possibility.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the case of planar adventuring, the perfect 
information the DM has (and the worst-case scenario that the players 
conjure in their minds) are the various challenges and obstacles the 
planar visit may hold.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Greg:</i> You think that
 you're leaving the world of simple manticores, hill giants, and an 
occasional dragon for foul creatures with endless resistances, spell 
resistance, high ACs, and the ability to teleport at will. But just as 
the DM won't (or shouldn't) throw you into a dungeon you can't survive, 
he won't drop you on a plane that has poison for air and a floor of acid
 and CR 20 monsters piling out of every door.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Andy:</i> Or at least, not more than once, unless he appreciates broken chairs and bruised ribs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Greg: </i>The first step
 is finding out what you need to know before you go. If you can visit a 
sage, do it. Ask your local magic shop about things you might need -- if
 it's a high-adventure campaign world, there's a good chance the 
merchants know as much as anyone about the survival gear you'll want.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">If you're in a rush, those 
options might not be available, but hey -- that's what skill points are 
for. Turn to Stannis the wizard and ask him. Those ranks in Knowledge 
(the Planes) can be useful. If you don't have those ranks, turn to your 
handy (not necessarily dandy) bard and see if he knows a tale or two 
about the plane in question (hopefully said story doesn't hinge on the 
rhyming of "exsanguinate"). If your group has neither of those options, 
turn to higher powers via <i>divination</i> or <i>commune</i>. If you don't have those, well, who's in your party? The Marx Brothers?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Andy: </i>Nah -- too many rogue/bards to make a good 
adventuring party. Except Gummo, who seems more like a paladin/bard. But
 I digress ...</p>
<p align="LEFT">This is when the DM gets to share some of that perfect 
information with the players. Ideally, you shouldn't wait for them to 
ask the right questions. Instead, leave some clues lying around that 
they can discover and decipher. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Assuming they've already fought a few demons before 
heading to the Demonweb, the characters probably have some sense of the 
foes they're going up against. Go the extra mile by spelling out the 
most common resistances or immunities they can expect to face, plus a 
few of the signature powers of the likely denizens as well as the 
environmental hindrances they'll have to endure. You don't need to hand 
out a laundry list of everything that's coming, but a little info or 
resources goes a long way.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're about to throw the PCs into the Abyss, it's worth mentioning that the wizard shouldn't bother packing <i>chain lightning</i> (because demons are immune to electricity) but that the cleric and paladin should have <i>align weapon</i> as a top priority.</li>
<li>A handy tome on the drow high priestess's shelf should mention the 
swarms of enormous, fiendish spiders that plague the Demonweb (hint: <i>delay poison</i> &amp; <i>neutralize poison </i>might be handy).</li>
<li>A fragment of an escaped prisoner's tale could describe the effects 
of the plane's mild chaotic and evil-aligned nature. Yes, the cleric 
won't be as effective at turning undead, and the paladin won't be as 
effective at calming angry natives, but on the plus side, their spells 
should work fine.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><i>Greg:</i> And really, what more does a player want to know other than "how can I kill it?" It's not Mutual of Omaha's <i>Wild Kingdom</i>
 here -- no bringing back the babau for careful study in the lab. Figure
 out the key energy types to use, and look for spells that can be 
effective without needing to overcome spell resistance. If you're 
looking for direct damage, that's conjuration all the way. Manipulating 
the battlefield to your advantage is an oft-overlooked task for 
spellcasters, but you'll need all the help you can get in unfamiliar 
terrain. When in doubt, buffing your own party members always pays 
dividends. Demons are a crafty lot, so be prepared to occasionally lose 
control of your actions. A few <i>protection from evil</i> spells can save the party's bacon.</span></p><img src="2006%20-%2006-27%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Alternate%20Planes_files/dx0627tt_tacticstips_planes3.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="534" width="200"><p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Along
 with knowing what to expect once you get there, you should have a plan 
to get out. Planar doors aren't always two-way. Even though you can't 
control exactly where you end up with a <i>plane shift</i>, just about 
anywhere on the Material Plane is better than Lolth's throne room 
staring down an army of half-fiend drow priestesses and monstrous 
fiendish spiders.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Andy:</i> The planes can and should be an 
interesting, exciting new arena in which the PCs can compete and 
succeed. It's true that historically, they've often been more onerous 
than enjoyable (again, your old-school players remember when armor and 
weapon bonuses were reduced on other planes, and then there was that 
laundry list of spells that didn't work as well or maybe didn't even 
work at all, and for God's sake don't even bother coming if you're not 
at least 10th or 15th level), but the current edition of the game 
presents most planes as remarkably friendly to visitors -- at least 
environmentally ... the locals are just as nasty as ever.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As the DM, the planes give you the unparalleled excuse 
to haul out all the fantastic terrain, alien vistas, bizarre 
monstrosities, and unexplainable effects that you've been too shy to use
 in your until-now "mundane" campaign. (And shame on us for feeling that
 way, DMs -- <b>D&amp;D</b> has plenty of room for the fantastic even on
 the Material Plane, but that's a rant for another day.) Rivers of flame
 populated by shark-shaped fire elementals? Check. Glass-bubbled cities 
floating on an infinite ocean? No problem. Mile-high towers formed from 
the fossilized spines of city-sized dragons? You betcha. Endless web 
tunnels suspended over an infinite chasm of darkness? Sign me up!</p>
<p align="LEFT">But even if you know full well that's the reason you're 
leading the characters off-world, don't ask them to make the leap 
without first giving them an idea of where they're landing. Ultimately, 
most players are more than willing to launch themselves headlong into 
the great unknown as long as they know a little bit about it first.</p>
