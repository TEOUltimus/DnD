<p align="LEFT"><b>A New Look at Infrequently Used Spells</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-17%20-%20The%20Forgotten%20Grimoire%20%28Part%201%29_files/dx20070417_tacticstips_spells1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="166" width="240">Did you ever notice just how many spells are in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>?
 Roughly a third of the book is dedicated to describing the hundreds of 
spells available for clerics, sorcerers, wizards, and other 
spellcasters. A couple of dozen spells, often blatantly offensive or 
defensive in nature, tend to fall into the "no-brainer" list for all but
 the most specialized of spellcasters, such as <i>magic missile, fireball, mage armor, cure </i>spells,<i></i>and<i> protection from energy</i> (and for you power players out there, <i>miracle</i> and <i>wish</i>).
 Beyond this immediate list, however, are spells that may not always get
 the recognition that they deserve -- for both the player and the DM.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This series focuses on several spells that do not get 
frequent use in play, but are nonetheless interesting and effective when
 used in the proper manner. What's more, we'll be giving a nod to the 
DMs out there, hopefully inspiring them to use these spells as a way to 
keep the characters on their toes, or perhaps even start an entire 
campaign simply by the casting of one . . . little . . . spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In this first installment, look at a few illusion and enchantment spells that may get short shrift from a spellcaster.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><b>Calm Emotions</b></i></p>
<p align="LEFT">In a game full of swinging swords and eldritch spell blasts, <i>calm emotions</i>
 may seem a little out of place. However, this spell is remarkably 
useful for both defusing potentially dangerous situations and negating 
some of the effects from other spells and situations (both good and bad,
 depending on where you are on the receiving end). While action-oriented
 players may disdain <i>calm emotions</i> as "too pacifistic," its 
in-game uses are undeniable. Hit the orc barbarian with this spell to 
deny him his rage for the encounter and see if you think the spell is 
too weak. Also, casting this spell on a person that you're sure is going
 to act in a less-than-appreciative manner before interacting with him 
may work in your favor. If you're pretty sure that Gustavor the 
Blacksmith is going to hate your guts, casting <i>calm emotions </i>on him beforehand could prevent a fight from breaking out.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Calm Emotions</i> -- For the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes you're in a position as a DM where violence is
 not the answer. Arming an NPC with this spell (often times while hidden
 away) can defuse a volatile situation and bring the game back to its 
roleplaying aspect. Although players instantly become suspicious when 
they want to start a fight and, after a few unsuccessful dice rolls, are
 told "you feel strangely peaceful about the situation," it does force 
them to stop and think for a moment before charging in with swords 
drawn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><b>Dream</b></i></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Dirty Little Secret About Illusions</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Illusions are a prominent feature in many adventures. If
 used correctly, an illusion steers players in the right direction or 
produces the red herring needed to throw them off the trail if the game 
is moving too quickly. However, here's something that few people 
realize:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Player characters are meant to see through illusions eventually.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The perfect illusion utterly deludes the PCs into 
believing what the DM wants them to see. But, a door hidden by an 
illusion is a door (and an entire part of the adventure) that never gets
 used, which means that the part of the adventure beyond it might never 
be experienced. It's pointless to have an NPC conceal his identity 
through illusion magic unless the ruse is revealed eventually. The best 
illusions in the game (in terms of game design) work best when they fool
 the PCs for only a portion of the time -- "failing" for the maximum 
leverage of game play and moving the story along.</p>
<p align="LEFT">However, illusions cast by the PCs are under no such 
restrictions. They get to "see" how well their spell works against other
 creatures.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Need to get some information conveyed a long distance? Think about using <i>dream</i>
 next time. In addition to its unlimited range, the message conveyed in a
 dream can be as long as the caster likes. If your party is divided for 
some reason (and you wouldn't let that happen now, would you?) then <i>dream</i> is excellent for keeping them up to speed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Dream -- </i>For the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Dream</i> can be a fantastic way to start an adventure. As the characters bed down for the night, an NPC can use <i>dream</i>
 to pass along some vital bit of information or prophetic vision that 
gets the PCs motivated. This message need not be pleasant -- the dream 
could be dire and unsettling (although not as damaging as <i>nightmare</i>;
 see below). The spell does not indicate that the caster must use her 
true identity in the dream, so it's possible to cast this spell under 
some other guise.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><b>Nightmare</b></i></p>
<p align="LEFT">No, this is not the horselike monster of the same name (that's an entirely different article). <i>Nightmare</i>
 is a 5th-level illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting, evil] spell that is
 far more insidious than one might think at first glance. If the target 
fails his Will save, he loses a night of peaceful sleep and cannot 
regain arcane spells as normal the next day. On top of it, the victim 
also takes 1d10 points of damage! That's not too bad for a spell that 
can be used at almost any distance. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Nightmare</i> is the perfect spell for disrupting 
bards, sorcerers, wizards, and other arcane spellcasters, since it makes
 their lives utterly miserable. An arcane spellcaster who not only lacks
 sleep (in other words, one who is fatigued, as the condition) <i>and</i> does not regain any of his spells for the day is nothing more than a walking target.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Nightmare -- </i>For the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like <i>dream</i>, <i>nightmare</i> has wonderful uses, 
both as a story device and as a way to reach adventurers at the time 
when they feel the safest. While the characters slumber in their safe 
haven, the villain can send horrific visions to keep them off kilter and
 paranoid. After all, if the enemy can reach them in their sleep, he can
 reach them anywhere! Although it's not clearly stated in the spell 
description, <i>nightmare</i> could be used to send specific and 
prophetic visions to the PCs, both hinting at the fate to come and as a 
lure to goad them into action.</p>
