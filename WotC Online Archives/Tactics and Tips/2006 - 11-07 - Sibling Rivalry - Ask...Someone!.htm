<p>If you've been reading this website much lately, you've become familiar with the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/ask">Ask Wizards</a> feature at the bottom of the main page. But what about "Ask a Player" or "Ask a DM"? We're your full-service column here at <i>Sibling Rivalry</i>,
 so here goes . . . the only rule is once one of us answers a question, 
he immediately gets to ask a new one (no follow-ups, not even if your 
name is Helen Thomas!).</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><i>Dear Mr. DM,</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><i>How do you determine monsters' initiatives? And how come it seems like they always know what their allies are going to do?</i></span></p>
<p>Kind Player,</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/dx20061107_devils.jpg" align="right" border="0">The
 traditional system is simply to roll initiative for each different kind
 of monster in the fight, just like each PC rolls his own initiative. 
The four orcs would share the same initiative score, but the ogre 
tagging along with them would roll separately.</p>
<p>However, the crazy randomness of two opposed d20 rolls -- player 
initiative versus monster initiative -- makes for pretty unpredictable 
results, which in turn makes it hard for players to tell the fast 
monsters from the lucky ones (or the slow ones from the unlucky ones).</p>
<p>Lately, I've been skipping the roll entirely and just having my 
monsters "take 10" on initiative. This makes the slow monsters more 
reliably slow and the fast monsters more reliably fast, which helps 
clarify the players' view of those monsters.</p>
<p>As far as monster coordination goes, I try to run monsters 
appropriately based on their Intelligence, training, tactics, and 
behavior, but there's no simple formula to follow. A warband of devils 
or archons, for instance, should coordinate very effectively, achieving 
flanks and aiding another as often as possible. A pack of chaotic 
demons, on the other hand, shouldn't display the same level of 
organization and cooperation. Wolves try to surround and bring down an 
enemy, but a troll just throws itself headlong into the fray.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's just one of those "Art of DMing" issues that every Dungeon Master must figure out for himself.</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p><i>Speaking of coordination, why is it so hard for a group of players
 to figure out what to do in a fight? Every time I see players start to 
argue over tactics, I'm pretty sure one of the PCs is headed for a 
dirtnap -- it seems like you guys would see the value of cooperation.</i></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">To the Super-Coordinated,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Deciding tactics can be the most 
enjoyable part of the game, or one of the most frustrating. Characters 
have to face roleplaying challenges when devising plans, so a 
sub-optimal decision might be made for personality reasons. Also, the 
PCs potentially have to work with limited knowledge about their 
environment, and have to take in a large set of variables (Do the 
monsters have energy resistance? Do we all need to be able to <i>fly</i>? Who gets the <i>bull's strength</i>?
 Where can the rogue hide to maximize sneak attacks? What should we get 
Anabela and Prince Duckworth for a wedding present? We're dealing with 
some serious stuff here . . .)</span></p>
<p>DM: Y'know, I've heard candlesticks make a great wedding gift.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">But that's just the surface layer. Most 
players at some point in time have wanted to bonk a friend on the back 
of the head with a two-liter and run that character the way he wants to.
 If you can stifle that urge to ambush and merely "suggest" a tactic, 
then your patsy trusted ally suddenly thinks you're trying to run his 
character and you start a side debate on the merits of direct damage 
versus character buffing and pretty soon, the cleric's leading the 
charge, the mage is pouting, and the rogue is in a tree 300 yards away 
from the fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Long story short, cooperation's a fine 
goal, but let's be realistic. You're dealing with human beings, some of 
which have strong type-A personalities, and they're often going to be at
 loggerheads.</span></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><i>Dear Guy in Charge,</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><i>All of the run-of-the-mill arcane 
spellcasters we fight seem to be sorcerers and the toughs are 
barbarians. Are there no wizards or fighters in your world?</i></span></p>
<p>To the Whip-cracking Player:</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/dx20061107_barbarian.jpg" align="right" border="0">In your eyes, <b>D&amp;D</b>
 may be a smorgasbord of options, and character creation renders you 
aglow with transient nodes of thought, careening through a cosmic vapor 
of invention.</p>
<p>But to a DM, creating (and running) NPCs is a chore without equal in 
complexity. Controlling the most spell-like-ability-happy devil or demon
 is a piker compared to building and running even a mid-level prepared 
spellcaster, and choosing the high-level fighter's array of feats (not 
to mention using them effectively in a fight) is serious work.</p>
<p>You players may have time to sit out on the veranda and sip mint 
juleps while leafing through a shelf of sourcebooks to pick out exactly 
the right spell or feat, but we DMs have responsibilities, dammit!</p>
<p>Remembering that your archmage has already cast his <i>meteor swarm</i> but not his <i>delayed blast fireball</i>
 may seem fun to you, but the average DM wants no part of keeping track 
of the dozens of options at the NPC archmage's fingertips. That's what 
makes spontaneous spellcasters such as sorcerers or favored souls so 
appealing. Not only are they simpler to build -- since you're selecting 
far fewer spells -- but they're insanely easier to run, because you 
don't need to remember nearly as many effects.</p>
<p>As to why "barbarian" instead of "fighter," it's a little bit of the 
same (try choosing and using feats for a high-level fighter), but also a
 power-level issue. Without effective (read: slow and methodical) feat 
selection, the NPC fighter has a hard time meriting his Challenge 
Rating. The barbarian's rage, though, provides a simple boost both to 
offense and defense that helps keep the encounter meaningful.</p>
<p>It's true: Fewer options means less versatility, but versatility in 
the hands of an NPC is overrated. The average NPC isn't there to deal 
with a dozen different situations -- he's there to fight for a few 
rounds and then be dead.</p>
<p>(Which, come to think of it, also describes some player characters I've met . . . but that's another column.)</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p><i>Dear Mr. Monkeywrench,</i></p>
<p><i>Why do you players go to such lengths to avoid (or worse yet, to 
sabotage) the adventures I've created for the group? At first I just 
thought my stuff was too boring, but now I'm wondering if you're all 
just a bunch of insensitive jerks who get your jollies by wrecking my 
hard work.</i></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">To the Near-Sighted Mechanic,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Seems to me your job is both to create 
the adventure and to adjust it on the fly. If you wanted the PCs to do 
exactly what you wanted, why not run a Choose Your Own Adventure (who 
did kill Harlowe Thrombey, anyway)?</span></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="90%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p>If you want to assault the keep directly, turn to page 23.</p>
<p>If you want to get an off-duty guard drunk in the hopes that he'll tell you about a secret entrance, turn to page 26.</p>
<p>If you want to wait until market economies change and the evil 
warlord's hoard of gold is no longer sufficient to make his monthly 
payroll, turn to page 77.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p><span style="color: #000080">A great story doesn't unfold as you 
thought it would, so why should an adventure? You're dealing with some 
of the finest problem-solving minds and giving them a clear challenge, 
so of course they're going to come up with creative, 
out-of-the-wall-of-force solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080">Now, I can't speak much about sabotage 
-- if your PCs are actively wrecking your plans by killing off a key NPC
 three chapters too early because they think it'll be fun, you have 
bigger problems. But avoidance is part of the game. Your encounters will
 have alternate victory conditions even you can't think of, and some 
smart player is going to come along and break your pretty little kill 
machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000080"><i>Dear Mr. Killjoy,</i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080"><i>Why don't you let us kill a villain 
once in a while? I mean, they're always teleporting away, or shifting 
consciousness to an unsuspecting guard who calmly walks out the door, or
 whatnot.</i></span></p>
<p>Hey Sore Winner,</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2011-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Ask...Someone%21_files/dx20061107_villian.jpg" align="right" border="0"> So now I'm not supposed to have any fun? Have you ever considered what a blow to my ego it is to lose every single game of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 I've played since I was ten years old? Instead of whining about an 
occasional getaway, shouldn't all of you be thanking me for graciously 
putting up with decades of one-sided results?</p>
<p>Think about it: How many of my lovingly crafted villains have you 
defeated over the years. Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands? Is it so hard to 
accept that, every now and then, I want one of them to survive your 
ruthless, mindless slaughter in order to plague you and your little 
friends another day?</p>
<p>(Or from a more cynical viewpoint, so that I don't have to spend another four hours crafting a new NPC?)</p>
<p>But no, one measly villain escapes your savage rampage through the 
dungeon and all of a sudden it's me who's being unfair because you 
haven't quite been able to slake your thirst for blood. I mean, the 
gall, the absolute gall of it just floors me.</p>
<p><i>Have you no shame, sir?</i></p>
