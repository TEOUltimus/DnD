<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-15%20-%20Tougher%20and%20Meaner%20Than%20You%20%28Part%2010%29_files/dx0815tt_dnd_tt_20060815a.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="215" width="300">It's
 the Year of Dragons! As a part of this celebration, we're taking a 
close look at these iconic beasts, their abilities, and the best ways to
 fight them ... and come back alive.</p>
<p align="LEFT">We've reached the end of our series and conclude with 
the noble, regal, silver dragon. Even the youngest and smallest of these
 dragons are smart and pack a wallop when push comes to shove.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Terrain</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Silver dragons prefer lofty mountain ranges in which to 
lair -- the grand peaks fit their aesthetics and loftiness -- but can be
 found almost anywhere. Indeed, because silver dragons enjoy assuming a 
humanoid form more than their own (see below), you're just as likely to 
encounter a silver dragon in the middle of a city as you are in some 
dungeon or mountaintop.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The one place to look for silver dragons is both the 
easiest to spot and the most elusive -- the skies. Silver dragons 
possess the cloudwalking ability, meaning they can stand on even the 
wispiest of clouds as if it were solid ground. Those with sufficient 
knowledge and power build castles on these cloud tops, making it 
difficult to get to a silver dragon's home. Needless to say, from this 
vantage point, the silver dragon is probably well aware of your 
approach. To reduce this awareness, it's best if you can <i>teleport</i>, <i>ethereal jaunt</i>, or use some similar means to get to its lair instantly.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Dragon's Side: Silver</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like white dragons, silvers can increase their threat level using <i>Frostburn</i>,
 which offers information on spells, minions, and environmental hazards a
 silver dragon can use to protect its lair. Alternatively, you might 
modify environmental hazards found in <i>Sandstorm</i>, tailoring them 
from desert to arctic encounters. For example, transform slipsand, 
slumber sand, and softsand into slipsnow, slumber snow, and the like. 
Wailing wastes can be part of either environ, and flaywinds could fly 
just as easily with bits of ice as bits of sand.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Apart from arctic terrain, silver dragons are also adept at disguising themselves for city encounters. <i>Power of Faerun</i>
 introduces high-level campaign aspects, including kingdom building, 
battlefield commissions, and religious hierarchies. Any of these might 
be compelling hooks for a silver dragon making its disguised presence 
felt within the humanoid world.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Abilities</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Silver dragons belong to the cold subtype and are thus 
immune to cold damage but vulnerable to fire. Fire-based attacks are 
among the most efficient ways to harm a silver dragon, but most bolster 
their defenses with magic items and spells to avoid the worst from these
 types of attacks. Hitting a silver dragon with <i>dispel magic</i> or<i> Mordenkainen's disjunction</i> is a good way to eliminate most of these defenses.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Silver dragons spend the bulk of their time in an 
alternate form, often taking the appearance of a kindly old man or fair 
damsel. To throw off possible trackers, they mix and match this 
alternate form often, including gender. Like the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060808a">gold dragon</a> before it, if you suspect that you're dealing with a silver dragon, use <i>tree seeing</i>
 to view it in its natural form. If you locate a disguised silver 
dragon, don't let on that you're aware of its trick until you have the 
advantage!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Silver dragons use <i>feather fall</i> both to keep 
themselves from plummeting to the ground in the rare case that their 
wings fail and to perform breathtaking maneuvers. A silver dragon may 
intentionally stop mid-flight, then use <i>feather fall</i> to break its descent, sometimes insanely close to the ground. They may also activate <i>feather fall</i> first in order to cast spells as they drop.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adult and older silver dragons make frequent use of their <i>fog cloud</i>
 ability to enshroud themselves in protective mist. In a pinch, they are
 capable of standing on top of these clouds, thanks to their 
cloudwalking ability, thus assuring they always have the high ground. 
Opponents that find themselves in the cloud homes of silver dragons have
 to deal with even more mist and fog than usual. Make sure someone in 
your group is capable of casting <i>gust of wind</i> to eliminate this threat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you thought that fighting a silver dragon in the 
clouds and wind was bad enough, remember that Old and older silver 
dragons can use <i>control winds</i> to whip up dangerous, hurricane 
force gales, or merely create a stiff breeze to keep flying creatures 
(such as the PCs) at bay. They might raze the ground with these winds 
before dive-bombing from the safety of a cloud.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In a similar vein, silver dragons use <i>control weather</i>
 to shape the area around them to their liking. It's common for a silver
 dragon to make the weather around its lair considerably colder than the
 norm or to create a sphere of warmer weather for the comfort of its 
guests. Ancient and older silver dragons often wrap their lairs in 
perpetual storms, complete with freezing rain or snow.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you have the misfortune of fighting a great wyrm silver dragon, be prepared for it to use <i>reverse gravity</i>
 to launch you high into the air where it rules supreme. Because they 
are competent spellcasters at this point, they often combine this tactic
 with a battery of <i>dispel magic</i> on the victim, then letting him plummet to the ground without magic items to stop the fall.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Silver dragons can also cast cleric spells and those from the Air, Good, Law, and Sun domains as arcane spells.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dealing with a Silver Dragon's Breath Weapon</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In order to avoid or reduce the effects of the silver dragon's cone of cold, see the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060502a">white dragon</a>. Make sure that everyone in your group carries potions, scrolls, or wands of <i>remove paralysis</i> to negate the silver dragon's secondary breath weapon.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">We've reached the end of this series! Although each type
 of dragon is interesting and worthy of several articles of its own, 
sometimes you need to draw the line. Dozens other dragons can be found 
in various <i>D&amp;D</i> books. Remember to read the rules for each 
dragon intently, as they all have their own unique special abilities and
 tactics. Each dragon's specific strengths, abilities, and favorite 
terrain make encounters with them more interesting than just "claw, 
claw, bite."</p>
