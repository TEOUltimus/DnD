 a fight where adventurers take on several monsters can be frustrating 
for a Dungeon Master. While a player has plenty of time to contemplate 
her character's next move while other players enact their decisions, the
 DM has to run all the NPCs and pay attention to everything for the 
whole fight. Heroes often get an unspoken planning advantage because 
their collective minds can serve as a think tank that simply out-thinks a
 single DM. To help the overworked get some planning power back, we're 
providing <i>Monster Maneuvers</i>, a series of <i>Tactics and Tips</i> 
articles that shows how monsters can become more effective combatants. 
We begin with Winning Tactics for Demons, to offset the Minions of the 
Abyss series of advice for adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>General Advice</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When planning a fight using demons, Dungeon Masters 
should keep a few things in mind to make the encounter both more 
challenging and more fun.</p>
<p align="LEFT">First, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the number of 
demons in the fight, the last thing you should do is have any of them 
summon more. In fact, summoning more demons is useful only if you have 
statistics blocks for the summoned monsters ready to go (or are a wiz at
 running creatures out of the <i>Monster Manual</i>). Don't waste time 
by having demons with less than a 50% chance of summoning something try 
to do so in combat. It most likely wastes a round, and it gives the 
heroes a chance to regroup. For creatures such as babaus, dretches, 
hezrous, succubi, and vrocks, use the summon tanar'ri ability only if 
they can do so before a fight begins. For demons that have a 50% chance 
or more, it can be worth it in combat, but earlier is better than later.
 With demons that have a 50% chance of summoning one kind of demon or a 
smaller chance of summoning something more powerful, always go with the 
higher percentage chance. More weak help is better than a few stronger 
allies, and the higher percentage is more likely to have a result that 
affects the fight.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When choosing magic items for your demons, consider getting multiple things that deal area lightning damage (a <i>rod of thunder and lightning</i>
 makes a good choice if a demon can afford it), or poison. Tanar'ri are 
immune to lightning and poison damage, and most PCs aren't, which allows
 your demons to place the areas of such effects wherever they please. 
Similarly effects that don't harm chaotic evil creatures, such as <i>blasphemy, chaos hammer, unholy aura,</i> and <i>unholy blight,</i> are good choices. Happily some demons have these as spell-like abilities as well. They make excellent early-round spells.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Finally, remember that demons are chaotic -- they don't 
form careful battle lines or detailed plans of attack. That doesn't mean
 <i>you</i> can't have some idea of how they're going to fight, or that 
demons are stupid. Most demons are extremely mobile and should use that 
to their advantage. Don't let them get bogged down going toe-to-toe with
 heavily armored paladins or get flanked by rogues. A demon in a losing 
melee battle is going to go looking for a softer target. If a demon 
can't safely move around a foe it's losing to (most likely to happen to 
babaus, dretches, or hezrous), it either teams up with other demons on a
 single foe, or fights defensively until the situation turns in its 
favor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using Chaos</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Many demons have a laundry list of spell-like abilities 
and special powers. Knowing just when to use them can be difficult, 
especially if you're running multiple demons in a fight. Given that 
demons are supposed to be chaotic and unpredictable, one way to simplify
 their powers is to make the choice on when they'll use their powers in 
advance, regardless of how much sense it makes during actual combat. For
 example, a marilith can make numerous melee attacks, a grapple check to
 constrict, plus nine spell-like abilities (five of which are likely to 
be used in combat). Rather than make the most careful choice each round,
 simply list an order in which the demon will use her powers. If you 
know she'll use <i>unholy aura</i> first, then use melee attacks for 2 rounds, then go with <i>blade barrier</i>, then have another round of melee attacks, and finally use <i>greater teleport</i> followed by <i>project image</i> and another <i>greater teleport</i>
 to get back into the fight, recycling as needed until the fight ends, 
you don't have to worry about making too many decisions. While the 
heroes may wonder why the marilith suddenly teleported away right after 
getting close to the wizard, their confusion may work for you, and you 
have certainly reinforced the creature's chaotic nature.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tricky Traits</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2005-01%20-%20Monster%20Maneuvers%20%28Part%201%29_files/dx20070501_demons2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="232" width="240">It's
 also important to remember the traits common to all outsiders and to 
all tanar'ri. These aren't always listed with each demon entry, which 
makes them easy for a DM to overlook. Unless otherwise noted, outsiders 
have darkvision to 60 feet, are proficient with all simple and martial 
weapons, and do not need to eat or sleep. Obviously this makes them 
excellent guards, though the chaotic nature of demons undermines this 
considerably. When you add no need to sleep to the typical +8 racial 
bonus on Listen and Spot checks, many can find it difficult to catch a 
tanar'ri off-guard.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unless noted otherwise, all tanar'ri are immune to 
electricity and poison, have resistance to acid 10, cold 10 and fire 10,
 and have telepathy. The telepathy is most worthwhile as a way for 
tanar'ri to communicate with each other in battle without their plans 
being overheard. Demons may be chaotic, but they are also very 
well-coordinated. DMs sometimes restrict how well NPCs work together to 
represent they are not part of a single group-mind. For tanar'ri, any 
such benefit is easily explained as silent, telepathic contact of which 
the PCs need not even be aware.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Building a Demonic Horde</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">No single demon is going to last long against foes of 
the appropriate Challenge Rating who are ready for it. Being evil, 
chaotic, extraplanar, and well-known, demons simply have too many 
weaknesses for foes to exploit. A mix of demons of lower Challenge 
Ratings that are built up to the same Encounter Level provide a more 
complex challenge for PCs and generally lasts longer to boot. However, 
running one kind of demon can be hard enough, and running multiple 
demons may seem daunting. With a little set-up, however, it's not that 
difficult.</p>
<p align="LEFT">First, try to choose as few complex demon types as you 
can. A nalfeshnee has a lot of options -- a melee attack, Improved Bull 
Rush, smiting, and six spell-like abilities it might use in combat. If 
you need to add some foot soldiers to support it, you're better off 
adding a couple of bebiliths (their main special abilities [poison and 
rend armor] go off automatically with melee attacks, so your only 
choices are melee or web), rather than hezrou (five spell-alike 
abilities) or retrievers (one of four eye rays made in addition to melee
 attacks and you have to remember it's a construct). The fewer tactical 
choices you have to make, the less likely you are to be overwhelmed and 
make easy mistakes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Another factor is looking at what your demons might 
summon -- a succubus and a vrock can both summon more vrocks, so if you 
plan to use that ability anyway, you may want to team up a succubus and a
 vrock from the beginning to limit the number of different demon types 
with which you need to be familiar.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Next Up</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The next few articles look at specific demons and what 
they need to do to maximize their chances in battle. We start with a 
good soldier in the Blood War, the vrock.</p>
