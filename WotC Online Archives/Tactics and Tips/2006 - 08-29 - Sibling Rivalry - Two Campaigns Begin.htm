<p align="LEFT">We're going to take a short detour this month. If you're
 tuning in for Indian-burn-giving, noogie-thumping, pink-bellying 
sibling-on-sibling bloodshed, you'll have to wait until next month. 
Instead, we take you behind the curtains of a rare gaming occurrence -- 
the simultaneous starts of two new campaigns. We're each DMing one and 
playing in the other, setting up enlightening perspectives on how to 
approach the campaign seed both as a player and as a DM.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For Andy, starting a new campaign is old hat. He's 
become such a fixture behind the screen in our gaming group that 
barnacles grow on his chair. But for Greg, it's only his second stint as
 DM. How did each go about campaign creation, and what challenges did 
they face? Read on.</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Whenever I'm planning to start a new 
campaign, the first and most important thing I need is the "hook" -- the
 central concept that grabs hold of my brain and says "You must run this
 campaign!" Without that big idea, a campaign is nothing more than a 
loosely connected string of encounters, which ultimately doesn't excite 
me enough to drive me to organize and run a game.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Usually, this is among the easiest tasks for me. In 
fact, the hook often comes to mind well before I'm actually ready to 
start the new game. Since I never like to run the same style of campaign
 twice in a row, I knew I wanted something different from my previous 
game -- a gritty, low-magic, post-apocalyptic fantasy setting that 
focused on harsh environments and horrific, alien enemies (which in turn
 was a change of pace from my previous, heroic-epic-fantasy campaign).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-29%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Two%20Campaigns%20Begin_files/dx0829tt_sr_apocalypse.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="303" width="250">With
 the ambient desire for variety bubbling in my brain, I eventually 
stumbled upon a fun, fresh (if tried-and-true) solution. Out went the 
"high concept" of my Umber campaign, and in came the "classic" flavor of
 old-school, anything-goes, kill-it-and-loot-the-body dungeon crawling. 
And where better to place this campaign than the granddaddy of old 
school, the World of Greyhawk? Thus was born my next campaign.</p><span style="color: #000080"><p align="LEFT"><b>Greg:</b> And that's a great challenge to a player, seeing the entire <b>D&amp;D</b>
 canvas open up for character generation. When the party got together 
for character generation, I brought no fewer than five character 
concepts (goliath dragon shaman, duskblade headed for Green Star Adept, 
illumian spellthief with multiclass options, favored soul weapon master,
 and binder), ready to fill a role left open by the other players. After
 seeing a human knight, catfolk druid, and mongrelfolk ranger suit up, I
 settled on the spellthief.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But since I'm coming out of DMing a wild and wooly Hong 
Kong fantasy-action game, I felt like I wanted a more restrictive 
campaign the second time around. <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953857400">The Red Hand of Doom</a></i>
 will constitute the bulk of my campaign, and with that adventure's 
strong military theme, I thought a campaign fully embracing that flavor 
was in order. And what's more restrictive than the army?</p>
<p align="LEFT"> Finding the right campaign world also helped set those 
restrictions. Hearkening back to Andy's previous heroic-epic-fantasy 
campaign of "Bloodlines," I decided to set my campaign roughly 100 years
 after that campaign ended. Andy had used stringent race restrictions 
back then, so that was a natural keeper. Compared to his anything-goes 
world, I'm restricting my players to a choice of seven PC races. I want 
the choice of race to be an important part of each character's identity,
 and by narrowing the choices it's easier to define the relations 
between each race.</p></span><p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Ideally, any 
restrictions that you set on player choice should contribute 
significantly to your campaign's central concept. If the only reason 
that you say "no elves" or "no psionics" is that you don't like those 
parts of the game, you're missing a huge opportunity to craft the 
product that you're about to sell to your players.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That may sound a bit crass, but make no mistake: Getting
 your players excited about the experience of playing in a new campaign 
is a lot like selling them a product. While some players are satisfied 
with just about any <b>D&amp;D</b> experience their DM provides, the 
Dungeon Master who doesn't take into account his players' desires risks 
creating a campaign that stumbles, fails to engage the imagination, and 
maybe even flat-out falls apart.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i><img src="2006%20-%2008-29%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Two%20Campaigns%20Begin_files/dx0829tt_sr_wpm.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="194" width="300"></i>Back in the Wizards of the Coast setting search that eventually resulted in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>,
 participants had to submit a one-page summary of their proposed 
setting, outlining various key concepts. In writing my own proposal, I 
realized the immense power of brevity when wielded appropriately -- it 
forces you to focus your thoughts and your words on what's most 
important. <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Umber/synopsis.htm&amp;origin=dnd_tt_20060829a">My one-page proposal for Umber</a> turned into the "sell sheet" that I provided my gaming group when it was time to start the last round of campaigns.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> This time around, I didn't have a setting search 
guiding my structure, so I varied from the format I'd used for Umber, 
focusing on the key elements that would help would-be players understand
 what they'd be getting into with the <b>Greyhawk</b> campaign. Here are some excerpts from the sell sheet for "<i>Fear and Loathing in the City of Greyhawk: An 'Anything Goes' Classic <b>D&amp;D</b> Campaign</i>:"</p>

</tbody></table><span style="color: #000080"><p align="LEFT"><b>Greg:</b>
 I had it a little easier . . . all I had to do was mention the 
possibility of a military-themed campaign and two or three players were 
already hopping on board (perhaps I know my audience too well -- or I've
 watched <i>Band of Brothers</i> too many times with these guys). As 
soon as we settled on who would be playing in each campaign and let the 
players know what restrictions they had, the ball was in their court.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Truly excited players geeking out about character 
generation is a great affirmation that you've picked a compelling 
setting. Seeing as I had a group of five Type-A personalities (several 
of whom are organization freaks to boot), they quickly started on the 
task of determining party roles. A military squad is very much like a <b>D&amp;D</b>
 party, with each member filling important roles. My players tackled 
this by sketching out a 13-point checklist of party capabilities via 
email, followed up with a multifunction analysis of maximizing combat 
roles. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the simplest view, the key goals of any combat are twofold:</p>
<p align="LEFT">1) Deal damage to enemies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 2) Survive attacks from enemies.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But that's a bit overly simplistic, otherwise "fighter" would be the only class you need. So break down the categories a bit:</p>
<p align="LEFT">1) Deal damage to enemies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">A) Deal melee damage, usually vs. single targets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">B) Deal ranged damage vs. single targets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">C) Deal AoE ranged damage (multiple targets).</p>
<p align="LEFT">D) Enhance allies' ability to accomplish A-C via buffing offense or debuffing enemy defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">2) Survive attacks from enemies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">A) High personal durability.</p>
<p align="LEFT">B) Prevent attacks against low-durability allies.</p>
<p align="LEFT">C) Heal injuries.</p>
<p align="LEFT">D) Enhance allies' ability to accomplish A-C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">Each subcategory had further explanation as to which 
class abilities fit in each role, and then the discussion veered toward 
what roles could best be combined into a class that a player wanted to 
play. For example, a barbarian was classified as primary 1A, secondary 
1B while a druid could be primary 2B, 2D, secondary 1C, 1A (via animal 
companion). And 1,641 words later, the players had strong ideas of what 
jobs they wanted their characters to be good at, and what potential 
overlaps existed among their character concepts.</p></span><p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b>
 And in case anyone's wondering, yes, I'm the organization freak who 
crafted the preceding opus. I like to think of my personality as 
combining a little bit from column "obsessive" with a little bit from 
column "compulsive," thank you very much.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-29%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Two%20Campaigns%20Begin_files/dx0829tt_sr_mongrelfolk.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="321" width="200">Of
 course, not every group approaches creating characters with that level 
of anal-retentive detail. In the recent character-generation session for
 my <b>Greyhawk</b> game, the players approached the challenge of 
building their new identities much more from a story perspective than as
 a mechanical team-building challenge . . . hence Dennis's mongrelfolk 
ranger longs to become a master chef and fights with a butcher knife and
 a frying pan.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But you can't ask your players to craft characters 
without also outlining the house rules (if any) that you'll be using in 
your campaign. Now, it's possible that you and your group already have a
 comfortable list of house rules that you use in your games, but a new 
campaign is always a great excuse to evaluate how those are working for 
you and figure out if you need any new ones.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since my campaign wouldn't require the players to 
familiarize themselves with reams of background material, I felt 
comfortable crafting a reasonably large array of house rules -- 
concerning both character creation and at-the-table game play -- and 
which included several concepts they hadn't tried before.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While it's difficult to evaluate any given house rule 
out of context -- since each one often grows out of specific group 
experiences or exists in relation to some other homegrown tweak -- here 
are a few of the house rules I presented my players with during 
character creation:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hit Points</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> All characters start with an extra 10 hp at 1st level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> Each level, you gain hp equal to the max. result of your HD (4 for d4, 8 for d8, and so on), plus Con mod.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> (I wanted characters who were much more durable, 
particularly at low levels, and who also wanted to eliminate the 
inherent danger of low hp rolls.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">All skill ranks cost 1 skill point. (The maximum rank for cross-class skills remains normal.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> (I love characters who dabble outside their class's 
normal area of skill expertise, and this keeps that from being quite as 
much of a drain on skill points. I've been using this house rule in 
another campaign for a while now, and it works well without being a 
significant increase of power.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Magic Item Restrictions</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Disallowed:</i> Magic items that grant a continuous bonus to an ability score (<i>gloves of Dexterity</i>) or a continuous natural armor bonus to AC (<i>amulet of natural armor</i>). (Items that grant a temporary bonus, such as a <i>wand of bull's strength</i> or <i>potion of barkskin</i>, are acceptable.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> (I find ability-score boosters boring and flavorless. 
Worse yet, they're so cheap that they crowd out dozens of more 
interesting but less powerful magic items. Same with AC boosters -- it's
 just too easy to spread out your gold and ratchet up your AC to absurd 
levels -- so I picked the least useful of the lot and kicked it out. I'm
 hoping this encourages characters to keep more of the items they find, 
as well as to look farther afield for interesting items to purchase.)</p><span style="color: #000080"><p align="LEFT"><b>Greg:</b>
 Because we've been doing this at the same time, we've been able to 
bounce ideas off each other to better define each campaign's flavor. I 
was also concerned with character durability, but came at it from a 
different angle. Because the characters will complete "basic training" 
at the end of first level, I wanted to give them abilities and feats 
that matched that extra martial training. Instead of mandating that 
everybody takes a level of fighter for their second level, I'm layering 
most of a first-level fighter's abilities on top of whatever they take 
as their second level.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Doing a simultaneous campaign kickoff has generated a 
huge amount of excitement for both groups. There are so many options 
across the volumes of <b>D&amp;D</b> sourcebooks, it feels like Christmas to players and DMs alike.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's almost enough to make a player forget that his new party lacks a true healer . . .</p></span><p align="left"><b><img src="2006%20-%2008-29%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20-%20Two%20Campaigns%20Begin_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></b></p>
