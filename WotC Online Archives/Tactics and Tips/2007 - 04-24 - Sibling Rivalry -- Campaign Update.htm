<p align="LEFT"><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060829a">Last summer</a>,
 our authors talked about starting up their new campaigns. Now it's time
 to check in and see how things are going. Did the players cooperate 
with our DMs' intended directions? Or did Dennis manage once again to 
derail a perfectly good plan? Let's find out . . .</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-24%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20Campaign%20Update_files/dx20070424_campaigns2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="211" width="240"><b>Andy:</b>
 As readers of the column may remember, with this new campaign I was 
aiming for something a little less "high concept" than my previous 
games. "<b>Greyhawk</b> Dungeons" is classic lowbrow gaming at its best: roll up some characters, find a dungeon, and start looting.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The group of characters is just as eclectic as the 
collection of players. Every PC has at least one key element (race or 
class) from a source other than the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/175240000">Player's Handbook</a></i>, and some seem to think that hallowed tome is somehow anathema to character creation. Marc's playing a human knight <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953747200">(<i>Player's Handbook II</i></a>), Adrienne's a catfolk (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179280000">Races of the Wild</a></i>) druid, and Joe's a human warlock (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179250000">Complete Arcane</a></i>). In the role of "mysterious party leader," Greg's playing an illumian (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/177370000">Races of Destiny</a></i>) spellthief (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/177290000">Complete Adventurer</a></i>), while James hits on two entirely different capsystems with his xeph (<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/966660000"><i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i></a>) swordsage (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953787200">Tome of Battle</a></i>). And of course, we can't forget Dennis's mongrelfolk (<i>Races of Destiny</i>) ranger, who yes, still dreams of becoming a master chef (and has ranks in Profession [chef] to prove it).</p>
<p align="LEFT"> This is by no means a perfectly balanced team of 
adventurers. There's no healer. Area effects are virtually nonexistent, 
as are the various "utility" effects you normally expect from 
spellcasters. Almost everybody wants to get into melee, making the 
monsters feel popular indeed. And did I mention no healers?</p>
<p align="LEFT">But that doesn't stop the group from having fun, and it 
pushes them to find unorthodox solutions to some common problems. How 
many groups do you know are counting on their lone arcane spellcaster 
for healing?</p>
<p align="LEFT">After a half-dozen sessions, the characters are up to 
5th level. (We typically play for about 6-8 hours per session, one 
weekend day per month, and a typical session usually results in a level 
gained.) Most of that span was spent exploring the upper levels of the 
buried pyramid featured in module B4: The Lost City, but currently the 
PCs are halfway through C2: Ghost Tower of Inverness.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b><img src="2007%20-%2004-24%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20Campaign%20Update_files/dx20070424_campaigns3.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="343" width="240">Greg:</b>
 In stark contrast to this devil-may-care attitude, my Bloodlines War 
campaign kicked off with the five players scheming to form the perfect 
squad. Working off a matrix that outlined party roles, the players 
brought fairly broad archetypes to the table -- tank, healer, ranged 
combat, battlefield control, and skirmish attacks -- and then debated 
what fit best with each archetype.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">It might sound like the 
players had very little choice in what they played, but each guy 
gravitated to a different role and nobody was forced to play something 
they really didn't want to play. So when the first session rolled 
around, The Legion's 2nd squad of Spear Company/Hawk Platoon had an 
aasimar crusader, a human cleric, an elf scout, a half-elf sorcerer, and
 a human ranger ready for action, sir!</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">In watching the players go 
through this exacting process, I knew I'd have my hands full providing 
challenges. They had their bases covered, and then some. But to keep 
with the spirit of the military theme, I didn't want to throw them 
straight into the war -- they needed to go through basic training. My 
first challenge was to come up with an adventure that replicated basic, 
but also didn't stick them doing boring drills.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">For the first time in as 
long as I can remember, we played a full session and nobody made an 
attack roll against an enemy. For some readers, that might be a normal 
occurrence, but these cats I roll with like action. They like to cradle 
that d20 in their sweaty palms and make it sing. But I couldn't rightly 
have them fight other squads to the death (that might reflect poorly in 
The Legion's recruitment material), so something else was in order.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Some of my favorite moments
 in any war movie are the training sequences. I drew up an obstacle 
course that made them use Jump, Climb, and Balance checks and then make 
ranged attacks against targets at varying ranges. To make it more 
interesting, the other two squads in the platoon were sending their men 
through the course at the same time.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy:</b> Speaking as a player, this unorthodox 
session worked for two reasons; DMs looking to mix up their normal 
gaming patterns should pay close attention:</p>
<p align="LEFT">1) We knew it was a temporary aberration. Nobody feared 
that the rest of the campaign (or even an appreciable number of 
sessions) would be like this. Very soon, we all knew that we'd get to 
killing goblins, so starting off with something different just felt 
special, rather than onerous.</p>
<p align="LEFT">2) It was a shorter than normal session (only about 4 
hours). This wasn't a marathon of obstacle climbing; it was a piquant 
little appetizer that featured a very different flavor than the upcoming
 feast. I don't think it would've felt as welcome if we'd slogged along 
for our normal 6 or 8 hours without killing anything.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Along with 
recording who finished the course in the least number of rounds, I also 
rated each character's ranged combat success to give them a 
"leaderboard" of who the top recruits were. This helped build a little 
squad-on-squad rivalry, plus gave the players a sense of achievement.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">After a two-day march off 
base to refresh the players about planning overland travel, the hustle 
rules, fatigue, and all that, I thrust them back onto the obstacle 
course (while fatigued, of course), but this time they had to do it as a
 unit. The ranger and scout couldn't scoot through, leaving the cleric 
or sorcerer struggling to get over the wall. It turned into a new 
challenge against a "foe" they had beaten (albeit under different 
circumstances).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Basic training wrapped up with a "Capture the Flag" scenario against another squad (a <i>sleep</i>
 spell taught the PCs to mind their spacing better) and then a live-fire
 exercise to assault a fixed position. I designed the assault so that 
the characters would fail (but they didn't know that, of course) -- I 
had to show them that sometimes you can't just force your way through an
 encounter. For a military campaign, that's a critical thought to drive 
home . . . otherwise, I'll be dealing with more than a happy share of 
TPKs once we get to the real adventure.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">They did fail, but not 
before taking the fort and one of the two bunkers (the cavalry turned 
out to be too much to overcome). Egos bruised, the characters received 
their deployment orders and it was time to leave Fort Hornblade.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Good DMs never stop learning how to be 
better DMs, and the best way to do this is to run (and play in) a broad 
variety of games. Playing the same style of campaign with the same four 
players year-in, year-out can provide learning experiences, but not as 
many as you get from changing things up from time to time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I've been running <b>D&amp;D</b> games since 1981, and I
 don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say that I'm pretty darn 
good at it. But I don't think a month goes by that doesn't teach me 
something I can do better as a DM (or at least remind me of something 
I'd forgotten).</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, my Greyhawk Dungeons game has taught me 
very clearly that the natural order of dungeon-delving isn't "fight 
through three rooms, then go home" -- that's just an artifact of a few 
classes' over-reliance on per-day abilities (specifically, spells). 
Nobody in this campaign relies much on per-day abilities (the only true 
spellcaster in the group, the druid, styles herself more as an archer 
than a spellcaster, so she's perfectly functional even when she's out of
 spells). So when one session spent exploring the Lost City found the 
characters cruising through a whopping 13 consecutive encounters before 
calling it a day, it reminded me that deep down what players want more 
than anything else is to <i>keep playing</i>, and that anything contributing to that end is a Good Thing.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080"><b><img src="2007%20-%2004-24%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20Campaign%20Update_files/dx20070424_campaigns4.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="311" width="166">Greg:</b>
 Since I knew my Legion campaign would have a few more prototypical 
character types, the threat of resource depletion was going to be 
significant . . . especially since the uber-adventure is on a pretty 
severe timeline and the characters don't have the luxury of "sleeping it
 off," so to speak. By giving each character essentially a free level of
 fighter, the noncombat guys are a little better off when their spells 
run out and the heavy hitters can handle threats a little faster. 
Because of this, I got them into the main adventure about a level 
earlier than expected -- file that under "more fun," because who wants 
to be in training for three months of sessions?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Effects like petrification or sundering 
weapons or debilitating diseases may seem like interesting challenges to
 a DM, but to the player they all send the same signal: Time to stop 
having fun and go home.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now sometimes that's okay, particularly if the players 
could reasonably make the choice to forge on regardless of the 
situation. Sure, having a couple of negative levels sucks, but as long 
as the character can still contribute meaningfully, the adventure 
doesn't have to end. Carrying 8 points of Wisdom damage isn't a barrel 
of laughs, but it doesn't keep you from swinging that sword. Your <i>+2 flaming greatsword</i> just got smashed by a frost giant? Good thing the party has that spare <i>+1 longspear</i> in the <i>bag of holding</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's when that choice isn't really a choice that you've 
put up the roadblock to fun. If one character can't play (he's dead, 
turned to stone, or whatever), it's not fair to expect any response from
 the group other than "let's go home and get him fixed up." </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>D&amp;D</b> is a game, and the point is to have fun. 
So as the DM, do everything in your power to make sure the players (and 
you) are doing exactly that.</p>
