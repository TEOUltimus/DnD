<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Every group of players has a "Dennis" in it
 -- someone who inevitably comes to the table with a character concept 
that doesn't fit the game you've envisioned. (Sometimes they're even 
named Dennis.) It's like they can't wait to disrupt the careful balance 
you've so carefully created, introducing a character who doesn't even 
begin to fit the mold you've set up for the PCs. Don't these people 
understand the beauty of a perfectly designed world? I tell you, 
sometimes I think our job would be easier if it weren't for those 
blasted <i>players</i> mucking it up.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> For those 
nomenclaturally challenged out there, I'll be playing "Dennis" for this 
column. When it comes to the start of a campaign, players rarely think 
of the advance work a DM might have done to customize the world to his 
or her vision. With so many character options available, a player 
instead sees a blank canvas ready for the next work of art. Sometimes 
that art is a Dadaist masterpiece in an Expressionist world. After all, a
 player has to "get along" with his character for the length of the 
campaign (barring any suicidal tendencies). Dissatisfaction with a 
character can be a player's first step toward dropping from a campaign.</span></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Three_files/dx20060207tt_tacticstips_plan.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="192" width="281"><b>Andy:</b>
 But as a DM, isn't it my campaign? It can't be unreasonable for me to 
ask everyone to create characters appropriate to the game world, can it?
 I'm the one who came up with the idea, after all -- shouldn't all of 
you just be happy building characters that fit with my vision of the 
game?</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> In a word, no. It's <i>our</i>
 campaign -- it belongs to the DM and players together. I come to the 
first session with a plan, and if two other guys have the same idea, I'm
 going to browbeat them into other choices so I can be who I want to be.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy: </b>Hey, play nice with the other kids.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> It's all about
 party roles. You can't have four crackpots in your party -- everybody 
knows I'm the crackpot, so what are they doing treading on my turf?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">The decision of what 
character to play is the most important one a player makes -- and 
certainly the one he has the most control over. After the story starts, 
he's much more at the whim of the DM. Say the campaign's heading into 
the jungle and I don't like fighting yuan-ti -- there's not a lot I can 
do about that as a player. But when I have those 4d6 in my hand ready to
 roll up attributes, I'm in control.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">That's not to say I'm going
 to be completely oblivious to a DM's framework. If I want to play a 
half-dragon psionic swordmaster -- or an illumian incarnate or whisper 
gnome ninja or whatever odd combination I can come up with -- I need to 
have an idea of why my character exists. If I don't have that in mind, 
the DM has more of a right to slam the hammer down on my hopes and 
dreams.</span></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Three_files/dx20060207tt_tacticstips_hammer.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="265" width="184"><b>Andy: </b>And it's a really big hammer. Probably with a nasty crit multiplier, too. Why else would I be hammerin' all over this land?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Greg:</b> Playing a race or class a DM hadn't 
envisioned in his campaign doesn't have to be a negative. Getting 
invested in an "outlier" characteristic is a great way for a player to 
work with the DM to develop that mysterious backstory. You'll 
immediately feel more involved in the setting, and you'll be helping 
your DM with the (potentially) onerous task of world-building. That 
"different" character instantly gives the DM a bunch of plot hooks. Are 
psionics rare? Perhaps a secret cabal tried to rid the world of psionic 
races, and now they have the PC in their sights. Dragons died off 
thousands of years ago? What events changed the world to allow draconic 
heritage to be reintroduced in the form of my character?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Now that you mention it, I guess it'd be 
cool to add some dragon legends to my world's backstory. Maybe your 
half-dragon is seen as some kind of prophet, or even a bizarre 
throwback. It'll give me some good excuses to have some NPCs interested 
in the character and his allies. And one psionic character doesn't 
really wreck my vision of the campaign -- but does that mean I have to 
learn all the psionics rules? That seems like a lot of work for me just 
to accommodate one character.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Nobody said 
the job of the DM was easy. If you don't learn the rules, how are you 
going to find that nasty critter to be my character's nemesis?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">Seriously, though, the 
psionics rules aren't that complicated. I'll show you what my character 
can do before the first session, and I'll keep you posted on big 
changes. I'd be happy to be the gaming group's expert on psionics. Other
 players will wonder what my character can do, jealous of my hidden 
powers. And for once the be-all, end-all rules knowledge might not come 
from behind the DM's screen.</span></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-07%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Three_files/dx20060207tt_tacticstips_psi.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="272" width="198"><b>Andy:</b>
 As long as I don't have to be the expert on psionics, I guess that'd be
 okay. I know I can trust you to play the character fairly, and I'm sure
 I'll pick up the basics as we go along. And maybe you have some ideas 
as to how psionics might fit into the campaign world as I've described 
it to you.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> As any good 
player does, I'll bring plenty of ideas to the table. If I don't, how am
 I going to quest for my mother's legendary psicrown? It's my 
birthright, and I am going to hunt down each and every one of those 
psion uncarnates who stole it.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> I'm not saying that you'll get to rewrite 
the campaign history, but maybe you'll have an idea or two that I can 
incorporate into the world's backstory. It's always nice to have a few 
more legends and rumors to throw around, and if it means I can lead the 
characters into an adventure by offering something other than gold, that
 seems useful to me as well.</p>
<p align="left">Remember, DMs, "your" campaign world belongs to the 
players, too. They're not just actors performing predetermined roles in a
 story you've written -- they're helping to write the story that all of 
you will enjoy over the coming months (or even years). Not only do they 
need to know that their decisions during the campaign are significant, 
but that their decisions before the campaign -- that is, creating 
characters -- are also theirs to make.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> This 
"different" character also puts pressure on the other players -- in a 
good way. It forces them to develop their characters' personalities 
outside the narrow focus the DM has put on the campaign. Do they have 
prejudices against this new race? How does the party wizard view 
psionics? If the paladin hears a telepathic "voice" in his head, does he
 think it's his deity? Ah, if I can mess with the paladin, I'm all over 
that.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> When a player comes up with a character 
idea that doesn't quite fit your world, don't just reject it out of 
hand. Talk to the player. Figure out what makes this character concept 
so exciting. It may be so interesting that it causes you to rethink some
 of your assumptions about the campaign, but even if it isn't, do what 
you can to accommodate it. The setting of the game may be your dream, 
but every PC is that player's dream. Rejecting a character concept 
because you're too selfish to share your world with the players is the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 equivalent of taking your ball and going home because you don't get to 
play quarterback. The game depends on everyone participating and 
contributing, and that can't happen without a little give-and-take.</p>
<p align="left">Hey, I just realized that this'll give me an excuse to 
use that "ancient illithid frozen in a subterranean block of ice" image 
what's been hauntin' me nightmares recently.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> On second thought, maybe I should be a dwarven fighter . . .</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Too late, sucker. Now I've got psionics on the brain!</p>
