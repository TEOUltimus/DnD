<p align="left">Well, that depends . . .</p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Okay, Greg. So that's it for Deneb the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cleric')">cleric</a>. Too bad -- I'm sure the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_paladin')">paladin</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rogue')">rogue</a>, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_sorcerer')">sorcerer</a>
 of your party will miss him. Will your next cleric also worship Bort, 
patron god of foolhardiness, or are you going to try a different deity?</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Cleric, schmerick. I want to play a two-weapon duelist (whose deity also happens to be named Bort).</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Uh, no cleric then? How long do you expect this duelist to last, exactly?</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-10%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Two_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> I can already see the DMs out there nodding
 along. We've all seen this happen -- somebody decides to change 
characters, without necessarily realizing that they're also vacating a 
crucial party role.</p>
<p align="left">Particularly at low- to mid-levels, every character in 
the party must bring something to the group that no one else has. Each 
character may (and in fact, probably should) be a specialist, but the 
group as a whole has to cover the crucial bases in order to have a good 
chance of succeeding (much less surviving).</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-10%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Two_files/dx0110tt_tacticstips_cleric1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="237" width="187">In <b>D&amp;D</b>, the four basic party roles are usually defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> "Bruiser" (the tough melee-based character who serves as the primary line of defense against big, bad monsters);<br></li>
<li> "Blaster" (the ranged-attack specialist, traditionally an arcane caster with plenty of area <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> such as <i>fireball</i>); </li>
<li> "Sneaker" (the eyes, ears, fingers, and quiet feet of the party, who usually mixes <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attacks</a>); and</li>
<li> "Healer" (the one who keeps everyone else on their feet during the fight, and patches everyone up afterward).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">While plenty of variations on these four roles exist 
(and some classes don't quite fit), going entirely without any one of 
them means you're likely to have a significant vulnerability to cover in
 other ways.</p>
<p align="left">So what do you say to the player who wants to radically change his character's role in the group?</p>
<p align="left">First things first: Try to understand why the player 
wants to make the change. Don't jump to conclusions -- instead, sit down
 for a chat (or a phone call, or some email or IM banter).</p>
<p align="left">So let's rewind.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Cleric, schmerick. I want to play a two-weapon duelist (whose deity also happens to be named Bort).</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> Well, Greg, that's a pretty big change. Any particular reason?</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Deneb was a 
5th-level cleric when he died. He was a long way from getting to the 
meat of what being a cleric is about, and I was tired of just healing 
people. I craved action. I want to be in the fight from the get-go, not 
hanging around the outside waiting for Alarion to get dropped, or taking
 several rounds to buff myself up to bruiserweight class. If we can get 
the drop on a monster, we'll take it down before we even need that 
healing to kick in.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080">If you think of it 
economically, the decision costs a few more gold pieces per character 
per adventure as we stock up on healing potions and wands. But hey, 
Alarion the paladin can use a <i>wand of cure light wounds</i> pretty 
easily, and he can even give a try on some of those scrolls that Deneb 
was carrying around. And who's to say the next guy to take a dirt nap 
won't pick up the holy soup ladle of Bort with his or her next 
character?</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy:</b> It's true that Alarion could pick up some 
of the healing slack. That'd be a good thing to bring up next time the 
group is stocking up on supplies.</p>
<p align="left">You might also suggest that the rogue start spending <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillpoints')">skill points</a> on Use Magic Device, which would let her carry around a wand or two as well. It's only a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC 20</a> check -- maybe a little tough during a fight, but with a few rounds to spare she can get people back into fighting shape.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-10%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry,%20Take%20Two_files/dx0110tt_tacticstips_cleric2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="278" width="184">But
 that all relies on other players changing the way they play their 
characters. What about making a small tweak to your character concept 
that might allow you to keep contributing in that area? Look at all the 
other classes that can provide a bit of cleric-type mojo: besides the 
obvious <i>Player's Handbook</i> options, there's the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20051206a">favored soul</a>, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cwc/20050414a">shugenja</a>, and spirit shaman from <i>Complete Divine</i>, the healer (<i>Miniatures Handbook</i>), and the incarnate (<i>Magic of Incarnum</i>).
 Splashing even a level or two of one of those classes doesn't hurt your
 concept too much and keeps the party from being high and dry. Heck, the
 psychic warrior (<i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>) has a few "fix-yourself" powers, and you'd still be getting a bunch of fighter bonus feats!</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> Ah, the 
possibilities. Certainly, a tweak from the straight-up swashbuckling 
type is doable. Or maybe I can meet the same character concept with 
creative multiclassing . . . say, a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ranger')">ranger</a>/spellthief?
 He'll use two weapons and have the quick wit of a swashbuckler, but 
without the fancy shirt-and-pants combo. And hey, look at that -- I've 
even helped solve our "missing cleric" problem, provided I can steal the
 right spells. If nobody else wants that Use Magic Device shtick, I'll 
jump on it. Being the receptacle of semi-useful wands isn't the worst 
job in the world.</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy: </b>(Says the former player of the bard/<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fighter')">fighter</a>/holy liberator, who had more wands by 20th level than any character I can remember.)</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> So is this 
party of a paladin, sorcerer, rogue, and ranger/spellthief salvageable? 
We have a few dabblers straying from the specialty paths, but to me that
 makes for a more unique and memorable campaign. You're not going to 
ruin us just because we didn't pay perfect attention in Party Building 
101, are you?</span></p>
<p align="left"><b>Andy: </b>You make a good point. Since a typical <b>D&amp;D</b>
 adventure assumes a normal array of party roles, a DM whose group 
doesn't cover all the normal bases must be aware of that lack. A party 
without a true healer can't bounce back as quickly during (or after) a 
tough encounter. Going without a bruiser means everyone's likely to take
 more damage in melee, while going without a blaster means fights last 
longer. Of the four, being without a sneaker is probably the least 
punishing, but say that to the party that's just dragged itself through 
the trap-filled tomb!</p>
<p align="left">It's okay -- even recommended -- for a DM with this kind
 of group to adjust some of the encounters to keep them fun. You don't 
have to change everything (nothing's wrong with your PCs having a bit of
 extra challenge now and again), but make sure that your encounters 
don't depend on a missing role.</p>
<p align="left">A party with no cleric may well find that undead 
encounters get a little tougher, but that's fine. Maybe the sorcerer 
learns a spell or two to help with that, or the paladin takes Improved 
Turning. It's pretty natural for other characters to evolve to fill the 
"gap" created by this kind of character switch -- in a few levels, you 
may not even realize that you're "missing" anything at all. (On the 
other hand, if an encounter assumes that the party is absolutely doomed 
without a bunch of <i>restoration </i>spells, that's a good recipe for frustration.)</p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg:</b> And, of course, as players we can always threaten to come back as the all-cleric party. (After all, they were <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20050916a">voted the most powerful core class</a>.</span></p>
