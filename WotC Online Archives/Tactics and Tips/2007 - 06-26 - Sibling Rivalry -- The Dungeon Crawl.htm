as effectively).</p>
<p align="LEFT">This month, our siblings chat about memorable dungeon crawls from years past, and what made them work.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> For as long as I've been playing <b>D&amp;D </b>
 , I've been running you and the guys through dungeons. That first 
session when you, Kurt, and I played for 9 hours straight was pure <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i> (specifically, the <i>Caves of Chaos</i>, a prototypical old-school dungeon where orcs, goblins, undead, and other monsters lived nearly side-by-side). </p>
<p align="LEFT">Flash forward 26 years and we find you liberating <i>Blackrazor</i> from <i>White Plume Mountain</i>. Some things just don't ever change, do they?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2006-26%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20The%20Dungeon%20Crawl_files/dx20070626TT_dungeons1.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="314" width="239"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b>
 Well, all my prep for facing the ogre mage at the end went out the 
window when he turned out to be a halfling . . . dominated by a mind 
flayer. But other than that, there's no doubt the dungeon holds a 
powerful place in the hearts of players and DMs.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">A few very memorable ones come to mind . . . our first real foray in 2nd Edition led us to <i>The Temple of Elemental Evil</i>.
 This was the classic for me: You go in, you beat up some monsters, you 
take their loot, you head back to town to rest (or if you're feeling 
brave, you hide in some out-of-the-way room, rigging a fort out of 
overturned tables and leftover spears). Repeat as often as you want. I 
remember coming across the secret tomb deep on the third level, 
recovering <i>Scather</i> (one of the <i>swords of answering</i>), 
handing it to Breygon the cavalier and watching him become the absolute 
stalwart of the party. He stood there and took his punishment while the 
rest of us scurried around, and then at the end of the round WHAMMO! He 
hit back, and hit back hard.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Also high on the charts was <i>Nightfang Spire</i>.
 The entire adventure path of modules for 3rd Edition had a few choice 
dungeons, but this one really stood out as the ball-breaker. A 
teleporting wight monk? Shadows that can slip through the walls, floor, 
and ceiling? And always being under the eye of Gulthias, thanks to those
 damn scrying eyes? I never, ever felt safe in that adventure. So how 
does a dungeon become more than a series of 10-foot corridors, pit 
traps, and secret doors?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Well, if we had an easy answer to that question, there'd be a whole lot more great adventures out there. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But even lacking a magic formula, there are definitely 
some tricks that can help make a dungeon memorably challenging and 
entertaining for everyone at the table.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The last part of that sentence bears repeating -- a 
dungeon isn't great just because the DM had fun snuffing the PCs. It 
doesn't take DM or adventure-design skill to kill off PCs; in fact, the 
reverse is true. Really crappy DMs and adventure writers have been 
killing off PCs (and campaigns) for decades. What takes skill is to 
write a dungeon that pushes players and characters to their limits 
without just arbitrarily dropping them into a pit of lava or throwing a 
dozen balors at them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, I know a lot of folks out there claim to 
have fond memories of the Tomb of Horrors. I think they're either crazy 
or lying to themselves. I ran that adventure a few times back in the 
day, but as I recall the players didn't seem to find it nearly as 
entertaining as I did.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2006-26%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20The%20Dungeon%20Crawl_files/dx20070626TT_dungeons2.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="193" width="240"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b>
 I hated it. I distinctly remember asking you when we were done exactly 
how many monsters were in the dungeon. The answer? Four. A random 
four-armed gargoyle, a mummy that pretended to be a lich, a siren, and 
then A DEMI-LICH THAT CAN'T BE HURT except for a few very corner cases 
involving uber-powerful weapons and specific character classes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">What put Gygax in such a horrible, PC-hatin' mood to write that module?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">Players still need to feel 
threatened. Ratheof, my halfling thief, got his hand chopped off in the 
Temple of Elemental Evil on an ill-advised solo foray (he was looking 
for Christmas presents for the other PCs . . . I think he ended up 
finding a <i>frostbrand</i>). We lost several characters in <i>Nightfang Spire</i>
 -- and not just to falling out of the side of the tower on a slide 
trap, and then having the sarcophagus lid we used to prop open the trap 
door slip through and plummet the hundreds of feet down on top of you 
Wile E. Coyote-style. (Sorry Jarvis . . . best death ever, narrowly 
edging Adarrial's failed feign-death bluff of being reanimated as a 
zombie when the necromancer was intending to bring me back as a shadow.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">These dungeons didn't flat-out say, "Welcome to my abode, now please prepare your endless supply of 5,000 gp diamonds and <i>raise dead</i> spells." They had style.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> And when I think of style, I'm really 
thinking about two key elements that all of my favorite dungeons combine
 admirably: story and game play.</p>
<p align="LEFT">By story, I don't mean five pages of backstory 
explaining who built the dungeon ten thousand years ago, what used to 
live here but doesn't any more, or the unique runescript invented by the
 author that appears in various places but doesn't actually provide 
clues for the players.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I'm really talking about the dungeon's basic story hook.
 Effectively, this is the dungeon's "ur-story"; it's what the characters
 get to learn pretty quickly as they adventure, and what the players 
remember about it years later.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The story hook should be short and to the point. If you 
can't put it into one or two sentences, chances are it's too complex for
 the players to really appreciate. Here are a couple of classic <b>D&amp;D </b> dungeons' story hooks as examples, plus a newer one that I think qualifies for "instant classic" status.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>A multilevel subterranean complex of rooms with four rival 
temples whose areas mirror their elemental themes, all of which answer 
to a trapped demon that the characters might accidentally set loose.<br><br></i></li>
<li><i>A big wooden fortress full of partying hill giants, with more monsters, escaped slaves, and a weird shrine in the basement.<br><br></i></li>
<li><i>An enormous tower filled with charnel tombs, deadly traps, and 
undead servitors, ruled by a powerful vampire wizard who can spy on you 
anywhere in his lair.</i></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Are these stories complicated and multilayered? No, and 
that's a good thing. It's exceedingly hard to get across complicated 
stories in your average dungeon. Subtle clues go unrecognized or are 
simply ignored, and unless the payoff to "solving" the dungeon's 
backstory provides a useful tool to the PCs, it's a luxury at best (and a
 distraction at worst).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2006-26%20-%20Sibling%20Rivalry%20--%20The%20Dungeon%20Crawl_files/dx20070626TT_dungeons3.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="344" width="240"><span style="color: #000080"><b>Greg: </b>
 In my first campaign, I knew I wanted to have a dungeon the players 
remembered. Reviewing my notes from when I started planning the Island 
campaign, I saw "haunted sanitarium" and knew that was a solid hook. I 
spent several false starts crafting the actual adventure by getting 
tangled up in the history of the asylum, what clan ran it, and tiny 
details of how the facility fell into disarray. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">When I took a step back and
 made a list of cool undead and other insanity-themed abominations that 
might be in the dungeon, the adventure practically wrote itself. The 
hook was simply that evil forces had taken over this seemingly 
abandoned, remote facility, but there had been patients left behind . . .
 and not for the better. The electro-shock room now housed a living 
shocking grasp. The water-treatment room was home to a drowned. A brain 
in a jar was hiding in the vivisection/autopsy lab.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style="color: #000080">The granular story of the 
"module" wasn't nearly as important as how it fit into the story of the 
campaign. The characters spent just enough time figuring out that this 
place was full of bad juju and there wasn't a way out (they had been 
teleported there via a fake crematorium furnace), so they had to open 
every door and check every room -- just like any good dungeon demands.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Andy: </b> Looking back, I'd say that was definitely 
the strongest "story hook" of any portion of the Island campaign. While 
the campaign wasn't really dungeon-focused, there were at least three 
that I can remember, and that one stands out the most clearly. The 
monsters had an obvious "reason to be there" (while believability is 
often overemphasized, it's nice to have at least a nod toward it that 
players can accept), and we quickly understood the kinds of horrific 
stuff we'd be facing.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A good story hook is only half the battle, though. A 
dungeon benefits greatly from interesting story elements, but it only 
sings when that's coupled with entertaining game play.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But for that, you'll have to wait until next month . . .</p>
