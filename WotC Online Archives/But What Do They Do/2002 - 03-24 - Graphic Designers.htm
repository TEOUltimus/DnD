        for Wizards of the Coast as a graphic designer is a long ways from painting 
        a mule. But that's how Dee Barnett made her first dollar in the field.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
        was still in high school when I was asked to paint a large mule on a banner 
        for a Democratic Convention in Kansas City, Missouri," she recalls. 
        "I think the pay was fifty dollars."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This, 
        however, was step one on the road to commercial art (at Kansas City Art 
        Institute and School of Design, where she majored in painting and minored 
        in sculpture) and then to graphic design (at TSR, Inc., in Lake Geneva, 
        Wisconsin). "It was my first experience with the gaming industry," 
        she admits. "We didn't have computers to work on then, so everything 
        -- our covers, type galleys -- were pasted up on boards and sent to the 
        printers to have the plates made, so the product could go to press." 
        The computer finally arrived a few years later, but it was still a foreign 
        object to Dee. "I had never touched one before. The company helped 
        me out by sending me to take some classes in Quark XPress, Photoshop, 
        and Adobe Illustrator." These are still many of the tools of her 
        trade, years later.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dee's 
        work back in 1990 involved designing and pasting up roleplaying games, 
        novel covers, and type galleys; she also illustrated numerous design elements 
        for the interiors of various game modules. "One of the first ones 
        I remember was a pen-and-ink border that ran across the top of the interior 
        pages," she recalls. "It was of a crumbling stone wall with 
        arches and bones, and skulls were scattered among the ruins. This was 
        quite a leap from the corporate brochures and menu designs that I'd been 
        working on in the past... and it was a lot more fun."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="2002%20-%2003-24%20-%20Graphic%20Designers_files/alternity_phb_med.jpg" align="right" height="220" width="176"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like 
        many TSR people, Dee made the transfer from Wisconsin to Washington in 
        1997, when she had just begun to work on the interior layout design of 
        a new product line called <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/alternity/">Alternity</a></b>. 
        </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I had 
        begun the job in Lake Geneva," she says, "and when we moved, 
        the work was collected to disk to be shipped to Wizards in Renton. Somehow 
        en route, the files were corrupted, and I had to rebuild them when I arrived. 
        After that rebuild, I had a computer crash, and the files were lost <i>again</i> 
        because our backup system was not working properly. So we needed to do 
        another redo."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
        Artistry</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 
        the years, her responsibilities have shifted some, but the core of her 
        work remains the same: graphic design. "I do design work and am expected 
        to get the product ready for production," she says simply. The task 
        itself, however, is not simply done. It requires a great deal of care 
        and attention to detail to meet the necessary guidelines. "The size 
        of a document must be correct and the files put together the right way," 
        she notes. "If there are any questions, we have a great staff that's 
        always willing to help us assure that the product will print correctly."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her art 
        background is in constant use. "I build my final files in CMYK -- 
        that's the four-color process used in the printing industry," she 
        explains. "The beautiful full-color art that you see reproduced is 
        made up of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black inks in a very fine dot pattern: 
        CMYK. We in the design department need to be aware of the limitations 
        of this process. If I want some of my type to be purple and it's a small 
        size, I shouldn't use more than two of the four colors, and if it's smaller 
        than 8 or 9 points, you're safer to stick with black."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, 
        to create a purple color, Dee could use 70 percent Cyan and 100 percent 
        Magenta. "If I tried to add a little yellow or black, it would create 
        a sort of halo and fuzz out the type," she points out, "and 
        there just wouldn't be enough room to include three or four colors in 
        a tiny dot pattern in a small letterform. There are ways to plan a design 
        around this. You can use process colors, which come in any color or tint 
        that you want, and they would print clearly because the color wouldn't 
        be made up of three or four separate colors in a dot pattern, only one." 
        There are other choices, too: opaque inks, such as white, that show up 
        if a designer used a dark-colored paper to print on, and even Metallic 
        inks are available. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If 
        you were to add a fifth color to a job such as a process color," 
        Dee notes, "the cost of printing goes up, and some of the other choices 
        might even require more than one pass through the press. Cost is always 
        a factor that designers have to keep in mind when designing a job, and 
        they need to know the budget that has been is allocated for it. I can 
        have two or three jobs on my plate at the same time, sometimes more. They 
        are usually in different stages of development, and if one is routing 
        through the different departments for approval, I can pick up on another."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
        Making of a Book</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, 
        Dee has designed the look for a new series of adventure novels based on 
        the new edition of the <b>D&amp;D </b>game. "I've finished the design 
        for the first three books and am now in the process of getting the information 
        for books four and five," she says. "The book department will 
        decide what art they want on the cover and send me the cover copy."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="2002%20-%2003-24%20-%20Graphic%20Designers_files/silver_marches_med.jpg" align="right" height="206" width="176"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        process of designing book covers is a little different from choosing and 
        mixing colors. "In this book series," Dee explains, "I 
        have been picking up a heroic figure from a previously published <b>D&amp;D</b> 
        product illustration, clipping it out, and combining it with a monster 
        illustration that's appropriate for the story. Then I meld the two in 
        Photoshop in a kind of collage effect. I have some other book covers in 
        progress, and a <b>D&amp;D</b> module cover coming up. I'm also finishing 
        up three decorative rune symbols that will go on some of the chapter start 
        pages in the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=fr/welcome,3">Forgotten Realms</a></b> 
        module <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88567">Silver Marches</a></i>. 
        I always like to know what jobs are coming my way as soon as possible. 
        If I'm not ready to start to work on them, I can still start the thought 
        processes."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her involvement 
        in a project usually begins with a meeting with an art director and/or 
        with the game designers, editors, product managers, and marketing. This 
        meeting gives them all an opportunity to discuss the feeling they're looking 
        for, what the product is going to be, whether it has more of a fantasy 
        or science-fiction feel to it. "If I'm working on the interior design," 
        Dee says, "I need to know if it's going to need any special requirements, 
        sidebars, or charts. What do they expect the word count to be per page? 
        That could determine what typeface I decide to use. In fact, it's always 
        good to get a sample chapter that is representative of the product to 
        use when working up sample designs. There might be just me or other designers 
        from the RPG group working on initial designs. We explore typefaces that 
        we feel would be appropriate and develop designs that we feel meet their 
        criteria."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, 
        the group holds a second meeting to present the design options, and the 
        group chooses one of them. "At this point, whoever's design is selected 
        finishes the product, our art director places the art order, we get together 
        with typesetting to show them our design, and they set up a Quark template 
        for the new document," Dee explains. "The pieces begin to come 
        together."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though 
        she spends much of her time now on RPGs and novels, even these are not 
        without their design oddities. "I've had to draw a page full of grublike 
        worms to be used as a background on the dust jacket for R.A. Salvatore's 
        <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR08589">Dark Elf Trilogy</a> and another 
        background full of spiders for <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?tsr21800">Legacy 
        of the Drow</a></i>, a novel by the same author," she says. Her favorites, 
        though, have been those that commanded much more of her talents than drawing 
        bugs. "The <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/DnD_BR.asp">Birthright</a></b><font color="#800080"><i> 
        </i></font>campaign," she says, was one of her favorites. "I 
        designed the interior layout and painted the frames that held the illustrations, 
        and the watercolor page backgrounds that were used in the first few modules."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the 
        <i><b>Planescape</b> Campaign Setting,</i> which Dee also cites as a source 
        of pride in her work, the game designers and editors strove for a look 
        that was new and different, something that really "flowed."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Everyone 
        involved with the project did a great job. I think it was an Origins Award 
        Winner that year," she says with pride.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>New 
        Horizons</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
        moving to Wizards, Dee has enjoyed designing the collector's edition of 
        the TSR <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/DnDCollectorsEdition.asp">Silver Anniversary 
        Collector’s Edition</a></i> boxed set and booklet covers, and she 
        recently completed the interior page design for the new Robert Jordan 
        <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?WTC11996">Wheel of Time</a></i> <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?WTC11996"><i>Roleplaying 
        Game</i></a>. </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It 
        was a great collaboration with my art director, Robert Raper," she 
        says. "He had a great vision of what we needed to do to capture the 
        right feeling for the module and I was very pleased with the way it turned 
        out."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 
        end, Dee sees the process a graphic designer uses to be much like the 
        way a painter feels when looking at a canvas. "You need to have a 
        strong composition, a balance, a way for the eye to travel through the 
        page, a way to make the important information stand out," she says. 
        "You can achieve this with color, the weight and style of the typeface 
        you have chosen, and the design elements you use on the page."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's 
        hoping that those Democrats recognized Dee's commitment to detail when 
        they first saw their painted mule on that banner all those years ago.
