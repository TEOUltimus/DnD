        Durham loves his job: project manager --<b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> 
        brand at Wizards of the Coast. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"What 
        that means is that I project-manage all internal intellectual properties," 
        he explains, "including <b>D&amp;D</b> and <b>Forgotten Realms</b> 
        and some others that are coming down the pike." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Okay. 
        . . and what does <i>that</i> mean?</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>So 
        a Project Manager . . . Manages Projects</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every 
        product that Wizards of the Coast publishes is considered a "project," 
        and each one involves many different departments in the company: R&amp;D, 
        Business Managers, Art, Cartography, Typesetting, and more. Martin is 
        the guy who keeps all these departments on schedule for their part of 
        each project, and makes sure everyone has what they need from other departments 
        to do their jobs and get the product out on time.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, 
        the job isn't simply about "moving stuff around," he says. Much 
        of Martin's role is to serve as a vehicle between the various teams that 
        create a roleplaying game product. "I act as the go-between for any 
        and all communications between creative teams and the business people, 
        as well as the different creative and service teams. Project managers 
        are pretty much supposed to know the basics of how everyone does his or 
        her job so that we can be that person's champion in discussions with other 
        team members."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The job 
        takes Martin all over the company and keeps him involved in the creation 
        of new products from conception to publication. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
        basic process," Martin explains, "is that the business guys 
        and the R&amp;D guys get together and figure out what products they want 
        to release in a given year and when they want them. Once they give me 
        that information, I create the schedule of when everything is going to 
        be due. This includes the cover art, interior art, and maps, and the text." 
        </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He assigns 
        predetermined amounts of time to each stage of a product's development 
        and production. And then artists, designers, developers, cartographers, 
        and editors get down to work.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's 
        when it gets interesting: Project managers have to juggle quite a few 
        products at once, all in different stages of development. "For example," 
        Martin explains, "right now, I'm working on the covers for the first 
        part of 2003, the interior art and maps for this summer's releases, and 
        the text for this spring's releases. As you can see, a certain level of 
        organization is required. I hope I achieve that soon...."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="2002%20-%2002-24%20-%20RPG%20Project%20Manager_files/ddg_med_r.jpg" align="right" height="203" width="161">His 
        workload is varied; working roughly 18 months ahead of release dates, 
        Martin currently has some 30 different projects in various stages of completion. 
        "That may sound like a lot," he admits, "but it really 
        isn't hands-on for me until we get to the stage of putting it all together. 
        Right now, that's <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88165">Deities and 
        Demigods</a></i> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[April

        [May release]. Both are highlights of my career so far -- they are the 
        first ones that I can truly say are mine from start to finish."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>It's 
        in the Bag</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What's 
        a typical week like for a project manager? Well, take this week, for example. 
        Martin started out with a scheduling meeting, where he and the other project 
        managers go over the projects on their lists "and look for roadblocks 
        we might be experiencing during the week." That's followed by a concept 
        meeting he runs for members of the R&amp;D, art, and business groups to 
        discuss the covers for products due out the first trimester of next year. 
        In addition, he attends a weekly cross-departmental meeting to cover ongoing 
        roleplaying game sales and marketing topics. "Other than that," 
        says Martin, "it's job bags."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Job bags?</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 
        bags, Martin explains, each contain a component of a product currently 
        in development or production. A bag might hold a book cover, the interior 
        pages of text, or just the maps, for example. Each bag also contains a 
        sheet listing the specs for the work (identifying the number of pages, 
        whether it's full color, and so on) and a sign-off form. "I move 
        those bags around to the various people who have to see everything so 
        they can actually sign off and say, 'Yes, this is good to go.'"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Martin 
        says he has anywhere from eight to 15 bags routing at any given time. 
        "Just about everyone in the company knows the project managers, because 
        we're always the ones running around with our arms full of oversized plastic 
        bags full of paper!" At least he gets his exercise -- the four buildings 
        in the Wizards office complex form a ring that measures a quarter mile 
        around the inside. "So I imagine I average about three miles a day," 
        Martin says.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>From 
        Banker to Wizard</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His career 
        is still in its earlier stages, as Martin has been with Wizards of the 
        Coast only a little more than two years. Prior to that, he worked in the 
        banking industry. "I was an operational analyst for a credit union," 
        he recalls. "It really laid the groundwork for what I do now. It 
        was looking at and implementing new processes at the credit union."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A theater 
        friend who was working at Wizards at the time sent Martin some job postings 
        from the game company, "and the next thing I knew, I was giving my 
        notice to the credit union."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
        July of 2001, he has served as the <b>D&amp;D</b> Project Manager, a step 
        up from his previous gig at Wizards, that of master scheduler. "Insert 
        fanfare here," Martin says of his former title. "That was the 
        coolest job title I've ever had. I always said it as if it were a superhero's 
        name. At the time, the master scheduler took all of the schedules that 
        the project managers had outlined and turned them into one big company-wide 
        schedule. That was when I was introduced to what project managers do."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="2002%20-%2002-24%20-%20RPG%20Project%20Manager_files/elminster_hell_med_r.jpg" align="right" height="206" width="148"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His 
        first project management job was the hardcover version of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?WTC21875">Elminster 
        in Hell</a>. </i></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
        just remember being fascinated by the novel process, how the cover and 
        the text come together to make a book," he says. It wasn't long before 
        Martin was carrying that 30-plus project load. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As his 
        career advances, Martin has no doubt he'll encounter lots of projects 
        that challenge him, and certainly many that bring him great pride. For 
        now, he holds up <i>Deities and Demigods</i> ("that's <i>my</i> first 
        project," he says) as one of his finer moments. "I think project 
        managers&nbsp;certainly do get the credit they deserve," he says. 
        "Internally, at least. I don't think that there is a single team 
        at Wizards that doesn't&nbsp;benefit from the Wizards&nbsp;project managers."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He gives 
        credit where credit's due, of course. "The creative&nbsp;people are 
        the ones who&nbsp;most deservedly receive the recognition by the public. 
        They are the ones who create!" he says. "I'm just the guy that 
        makes&nbsp;sure it all happens on time." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, is 
        this Martin's dream job? Well, he concedes that he wouldn't mind working 
        on a movie or TV project, but preferably in the capacity of producer. 
        After all, he points out, "Isn't a producer basically a project manager? 
        Of course, there really is more to it than that. While I'm still in 'pinch-me' 
        mode about being the <b>D&amp;D</b> project manager -- being on a project 
        like that, I would probably never touch ground again."</font><font size="2">
