      <font size="2"> 
      </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Art Directors 
        do not paint book covers. They don't pencil sketches all day long. They 
        may well be artists -- such talent certainly helps them in their chosen 
        profession -- but their title literally defines what they do.</font></font></p><font size="2">
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
        direct art.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dawn 
        Murin directs the art for <b>D&amp;D</b> at Wizards of the Coast; she's 
        worked on the world's largest roleplaying game since 1992. Once she discovered 
        that she didn't have the dedication to continue pursuing pre-med studies 
        in college, she realized that she actually loved art. So, after a few 
        years of producing screen-printing for a small company ("we hand-painted 
        T-shirts," Dawn recalls. "People would bring us stuff -- we'd 
        paint album covers, photos, whatever they wanted"), Dawn set her 
        sights higher.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
        got a job working in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, at TSR," she says. "My 
        parents were convinced I was never going to make a living as an artist, 
        but TSR had an opening for an entry-level graphic designer. And honestly, 
        the art director position sort of landed on me by default when all the 
        other art directors were fired."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organization 
        of TSR at the time consisted of a graphic coordinator -- someone who served 
        as a team leader for the graphic designers -- and a second person who 
        commissioned the art, which was someone who didn't necessarily have to 
        have a background in art, Dawn notes. In time, those two positions blended 
        into one, creating the art director position as it exists at Wizards today.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Most 
        people don't get what I do," Dawn admits. "I've tried to explain 
        this to my mom, but she still doesn't quite understand my job."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dawn 
        likens it to the role of a movie producer -- a key player who oversees 
        the big picture. As a new product is being concepted and discussed, Dawn 
        guides the visual direction of the product. What are the product's goals? 
        What is it supposed to be? What will the content be?</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With 
        <i>Oriental Adventures</i>," Dawn explains, "the product was 
        similar to the core books, but it was also going to be all Asian inspired 
        and themed. So, my goal then was to keep enough of the core elements that 
        it was recognizable as of the style of the new <b>D&amp;D</b> yet to make 
        it look different at the same time, more Asian inspired. I started doing 
        research; I went to the Asian Art Museum, I went to Asian stores, I even 
        looked at kimono fabrics. I was originally thinking of a kimono design 
        for the binding, but that didn't work out. Instead, I looked at Japanese 
        bookbinding. In the new <b>D&amp;D</b>, which I also art directed, we'd 
        set a precedent that the books would look like magical tomes, and I wanted 
        to carry that theme over into <i>Oriental Adventures</i>."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
        Dawn determined the direction she had in mind, she presented her concepts 
        to her designer, who began the same sort of research: how Japanese binding 
        is stitched and the level of complexity in Japanese artwork design (simplistic 
        and offset) as they began to design the book's cover. With that in motion, 
        they focused on the interior art, adding small touches -- using red, a 
        strong color in China, for the tabs and aligning the folios vertically, 
        top to bottom, as they appear in Japanese writing -- that provided added 
        flavor.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As simple 
        as it sounds, getting to this point requires an incredible amount of vision 
        and labor. After meeting with R&amp;D to discuss the goals of the project 
        and what they think the art should do for the book, the movie theme kicks 
        in again as Dawn shifts from producer to casting director. Who does she 
        think can pull off any given piece artistically? In the case of the cover 
        for <i>Oriental Adventures</i>, for example, she knew just who to ask: 
        Raven Mimura, who produced a stunning sumi-style illustration that fit 
        perfectly with the book's theme. But the task of assigning the rest of 
        the art is monumental. First, she reviews the lengthy list of interior 
        illustrations individually and determines who, from her pool of artists, 
        is the best fit stylistically for each piece. This requires her to know 
        each artist's work intimately. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Wayne 
        Reynolds loves to do dead things, for example," she says. "Zombies, 
        liches, those go to him. He loves them, and so he'll do them well."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, 
        she begins a massive tracking sheet to ensure that she doesn't lose track 
        of a single piece of art as the initial sketches begin to pour in. <i>Oriental 
        Adventures</i> alone had over 100 different pieces all happening at the 
        same time, for instance. These pieces route through Dawn, then through 
        R&amp;D, and everyone examines them carefully for style and composition. 
        If there are problems, this is the time to catch them; hopefully, everyone 
        involved in the process -- R&amp;D, the Art Director, and the artist -- 
        has shared the same vision, and the sketch can move on to final art with 
        minimal changes. "Sometimes we'll have to say, 'oops, the scene is 
        supposed to take place in the city, not in the forest,' and the sketch 
        will need to change slightly," Dawn says. "But for the most 
        part, we've all been working together for so long now that I know what 
        R&amp;D expects, and they trust me to get them the art that they want."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And Dawn's 
        work speaks for itself. <b>Dark*Matter</b>, <b>Planescape</b>, the new<b> 
        D&amp;D</b><i>,</i> <i>Oriental Adventures</i>, <b>Dragonlance</b>… 
        the look and feel of each of these games came from Dawn Murin, who oversaw 
        the art for each of them. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I'm 
        proud of all my work," she says, "but the new <b>D&amp;D</b> 
        is the most significant work I've done to date. I had numerous conversations 
        with R&amp;D about changing the look for the game as we began the development 
        for the latest edition. I recognized that we're competing with video games 
        more and more, that things have gotten a lot edgier, and that the lines 
        between sci-fi and fantasy seem to be blurring. I understood that if <b>D&amp;D</b> 
        was going to compete and be successful, it needed to change with the times. 
        It had to adapt and evolve." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
        evolution continues as Dawn serves as art director for <i>Deities and 
        Demigods</i>, for which artist Donato is contributing four pieces. "I 
        never really call him," Dawn admits, "because the rates for 
        RPGs are not like they are for <b>Magic: The Gathering</b>. We just don't 
        have the art budget. Our print runs are smaller, the sales aren't quite 
        the same, and it's more expensive to print a book than cards. As a result, 
        we just don't have as much money. So, there are artists I don't call on 
        just because I know they'd be insulted. But for <i>Deities and Demigods</i>, 
        I've been able to get some amazing people. Donato told me, 'I do the big 
        jobs so I can do the little jobs like this one that I really want to do.'"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
        to <i>Deities and Demigods</i>, Dawn is also in the process of art directing 
        <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> (a d20 product) and many other products for <b>D&amp;D</b>. 
        She has just begun work on one upcoming project she is very excited about 
        "that's going to be amazing," she says. "Henry Higgenbotham, 
        who did the three core books, is doing the cover." At this point, 
        she's overseeing so many projects that she can't even remember all of 
        them without her tracking sheets.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This 
        position is part art direction, part psychology," she says. "You're 
        working with R&amp;D, who are counting on you to get them what they want. 
        You're working with artists who need reassurance and guidance. So, you 
        have to be a visionary and a diplomat at the same time. And that's exactly 
        what you are when you're an art director."</font></p>
