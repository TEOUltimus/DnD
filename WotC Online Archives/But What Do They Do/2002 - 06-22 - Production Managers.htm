        Production coordinator. Production manager. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And you 
        thought <i>your</i> career path was a strange one.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It helps, 
        of course, if you're already a fan of the products you'll ultimately manage, 
        which Chas DeLong most certainly was. Nowhere in the job description for 
        a roleplaying game production manager does it read "must be a gamer 
        goob in order to succeed," but Chas freely admits that it might as 
        well. The man loves RPGs, TCGs, and especially miniatures. He ended up 
        at Wizards of the Coast after reading a random article about how much 
        fun it was to work at the (then) small company and deciding he'd like 
        to be a part of that. "Nerf wars, action figures, and gaming -- sounds 
        like my dream world!" he admits.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More 
        to the point, Chas was given the enviable responsibility of overseeing 
        some of the greatest roleplaying games ever created. At any given time, 
        he's tracking from five to 40 titles working their way through the various 
        stages of production at Wizards. These products range from mass market 
        paperbacks to roleplaying games. "I have the fine task of ensuring 
        that we design books to meet the vendors' requirements," he notes. 
        "I also have the task of working with the vendors and ensuring that 
        they produce the best possible product for our customers."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Goob 
        Wanted?</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Topping 
        his list of successes over the last four years (as it does the list of 
        so many Wizards employees): the release of the 3rd Edition of <b>Dungeons 
        &amp; Dragons</b>. In fact, <b>D&amp;D</b> has moved like a force of nature 
        through much of Chas's career.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="2002%20-%2006-22%20-%20Production%20Managers_files/ps_tomb.jpg" align="right" height="145" width="124"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"During 
        one of my interviews back in 1998," he admits, "I totally goobed 
        out when I saw the proofs for the product <em><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR01162">Return 
        to the Tomb of Horrors</a></em>.<font color="#800080"> </font>That moment is what most likely secured my job."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, just 
        what does Chas <i>do</i> as an RPG production manager? It's more complicated 
        than you might think.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First 
        comes the yearly schedule from various <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/wd/wd20020224a">project 
        managers</a> <font color="#800080"> </font>for Wizards's monthly releases; 
        the schedule indicates rough timelines for each step of the process, from 
        design to release. "Most of our titles have set specifications that 
        are detailed on a Product Brief Worksheet," Chas explains. "These 
        specifications include trim size [a book’s dimensions], page count, 
        color, and [paper] stock, as well as various other bits of information 
        that pertain to a particular title."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chas 
        gets involved early on in a project to ensure that all manufacturing specifications 
        are correct and to solicit competitive quotes to produce the job. "If 
        necessary, I obtain the templates for covers, map sheets, and any other 
        special needs from our vendors early in the life of the product," 
        he adds.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>From 
        Text to Tome</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="2002%20-%2006-22%20-%20Production%20Managers_files/ps_sw.jpg" align="right" height="145" width="124"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, 
        the biggest project on Chas's plate is <em><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/starwars/product.asp?88662">Power 
        of the Jedi Sourcebook</a>, </em>which will be released in August<em> 
        and therefore is</em> nearing the end of its design phase. "As far 
        as I personally am concerned, this product consists of two components: 
        a cover and the text," Chas says. "As they are designed, they 
        route through the various departments -- R&amp;D, Legal, Materials Management, 
        Spine Design, Brand -- for approval. There are three approval routings; 
        I usually see the second round for approvals." At this stage, Chas 
        measures the components to be certain they meet the proper print specs. 
        Then, once all parties have approved the various components, the job is 
        stamped final. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It 
        is about this point that I receive the final print run number and work 
        with our Purchasing department to create a purchase order for the vendor 
        who will produce the title," Chas adds. "The files for all components 
        are turned over to me, at which point I give the job one last look over. 
        I then turn the file over to Digitech. Digitech double-checks the cover 
        files to be certain that they were built properly for printing. They then 
        turn the files over to Prepress, and Prepress sets up PDF files for the 
        intended vendor and outputs proofs for one last internal viewing. After 
        that approval, I send the files to the vendor who's been awarded the job." 
        </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Approximately 
        two weeks later, the entire team receives from the vendor final proofs 
        for color and content, and these are approved by Design, Editing, Materials 
        Management, and Chas, as the production manager. "If an error is 
        found at this point, we almost always fix it here at Wizards in Prepress 
        to control external costs," he explains. "When the vendor proofs 
        are approved, they get sent back to the vendor, who then produces the 
        job." From beginning to end, the process for bringing the product 
        to fruition takes roughly a month. And with so many different pieces of 
        so many different projects all requiring attention at the same time, an 
        eye for detail, organizational skills, and patience make all the difference 
        in the world.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Memorable 
        Milestones</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="2002%20-%2006-22%20-%20Production%20Managers_files/ps_phb.jpg" align="right" height="145" width="124">Currently, 
        Chas is working on several projects that fans will undoubtedly find intriguing. 
        One in particular stands out for him -- <em><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/iw/iw20020111a">City 
        of the Spider Queen</a></em>. "This is the first adventure produced 
        for the <em><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11836">Forgotten Realms</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11836"> 
        Campaign Setting</a>," </em><em>Chas says. "</em>The cover just 
        crossed my&nbsp;desk yesterday, in fact. The image on it is an albino 
        drow priestess in her wispy gown of webs. This title ties in with the 
        <em><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88554">War of the Spider Queen</a> </em>series 
        of novels that we are also producing, as well as the <em>City of the Spider 
        Queen </em>miniatures." The complex interconnection between so many 
        products simultaneously obviously adds an extra level of excitement, anticipation, 
        and stress to the production process.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You might 
        suspect that, four years and hundreds of products later, few titles would 
        stand out in Chas's mind as being a particular source of pride. Turns 
        out not to be the case at all. "My favorite piece of work to date 
        is the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11550">Player's Handbook</a></i>, 
        the book that kicked off the 3rd Edition of <b>D&amp;D</b>. The R&amp;D 
        and Design teams did a spectacular job creating a new look and feel for 
        <b>D&amp;D</b>. I remember being on the first press check for this title. 
        I was so nervous, knowing that the final printed outcome was in my hands. 
        Well, as we now know, it really did turn out to be a beautiful book, one 
        that pushed roleplaying to a new level."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><img src="2002%20-%2006-22%20-%20Production%20Managers_files/ps_25box.jpg" align="right" height="145" width="124"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
        course, there are always more projects in the pipeline that demand Chas's 
        attention. By his own admission, one of the most challenging ones recently 
        was the <em><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/DnDCollectorsEdition.asp">TSR Silver Anniversary 
        Collector's Edition</a></em>.<font color="#800080"> </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our 
        Design and Imaging team painstakingly re-created seven of the original 
        D&amp;D modules and the original blue rulebook," he explains. (The 
        final set also included <em>The Story of TSR 1975-1999, as well as </em>impressive 
        artwork by artist Jeff Easley.) "<i>Story</i>'s cover and the box 
        that contained all of the components were created out of three metallic 
        covers plus black. We had several test proofs made to ensure that they 
        would print properly, and I had the task of going to the printer to check 
        that quality was being maintained. Bringing all of the components together 
        was quite a task in itself. There were so many different pieces that I 
        was sure something would go wrong. Instead, it all came together in the 
        end without&nbsp;any major problems whatsoever. I for one appreciated 
        all of the efforts that were involved in getting these titles out. The 
        final piece looked excellent!"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chas's 
        pride in his work as an RPG production manager could only have been rivaled 
        if he'd actually stayed on the career path he'd once envisioned. "When 
        I was a young child, I wanted to be Steve Austin -- the Bionic Man," 
        he admits. "In fact, at one point, I asked my parents if I could 
        change my name to 'Steve.' Fortunately, that never happened. . ."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunate 
        both for Chas… and for <b>D&amp;D</b>.</font></p>
