        on a book's page don't just magically align themselves. They don't adjust 
        the spaces between each other to ensure consistency, and they don't decide 
        for themselves if Times New Roman looks better than Bookman Old Style 
        for the text in question. If words ever evolve to that level of decision-making, 
        typesetters will be out of work.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Basically, 
        typesetting takes text files and art images and smooshes it all into a 
        layout designed by the graphic designers under the direction of the respective 
        art directors," explains Angie Lokotz, lead production typesetter 
        at Wizards of the Coast.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And making 
        those words look good keeps Angie and her fellow typesetters busy. "Our 
        schedules are monthly," she says. "Every month, we do four or 
        five books, each averaging 320 pages, and roughly three RPGs with about 
        160 pages each, as well as reprints and special projects. Right now, for 
        instance, my scheduling board has twelve projects and a total of 2,856 
        pages." Paperback books cycle through the typesetting process in 
        about four weeks, she adds, while higher-end hardcover RPGs, many with 
        more than 300 pages, are usually allowed only four to six weeks in the 
        official schedule "but require far more time," she admits. "At 
        this moment, <i>all</i> of the typesetters are working on big RPGs. We 
        currently have <b><i>Call of Cthulhu</i>,</b> <i>Prophecies of the Dragon</i> 
        (a <b>The Wheel of Time</b> adventure), and <i>Deities and Demigods</i> 
        (<b>D&amp;D</b>) in-house. <i>Cthulhu</i> took about three weeks to produce 
        a first galley." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The process 
        for "smooshing" type into a layout has evolved quite a bit since 
        the time Angie joined the TSR staff back at the beginning of January 1989. 
        Prior to typesetting for the game company, she worked as the production 
        manager of one of the biggest newspaper-style shoppers in south central 
        Wisconsin. "I was responsible for getting the paper -- or three or 
        four papers -- ready for press: proofing, paginating, shooting, making 
        plates, all of that," she says. "And at the time, there was 
        this new game out. Some people down in Lake Geneva were making it. So, 
        we tried it. It had these funky dice, my character rolls did not please 
        me, and I had problems trusting the DM. I preferred Scrabble."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The game 
        might not have held much appeal for Angie, but the company that made <b>Dungeons 
        &amp; Dragons</b> certainly did when she visited its headquarters years 
        later. "I had actually interviewed at TSR before Christmas of 1988 
        and had been given a tour," she recalls. "I could not believe 
        that this was the place that made that funky little dice game I remembered 
        from years ago. I saw a bustling place with some <i>very</i> interesting 
        people. Zeb [Cook]'s cube was packed floor to ceiling with Transformers. 
        There were paintings, games, and toys everywhere. They even had a department 
        where people just made maps. I had always worked at 'casual dress, high 
        creativity' -type places, but this one topped the list. I called every 
        day saying I'd start right away. They insisted I wait until January --something 
        about waiting until after Christmas break. The rest is history."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TSR's 
        typesetting process, though far from antiquated at the time, was still 
        quite a bit removed from the process Angie uses now. "We used to 
        set type on Compugraphic equipment," she says, "and it was a 
        convoluted, though interesting, process." Unformatted text was fed 
        into a mainframe, and codes were added manually to guide formatting. "High-tech 
        codes, like '&lt;bb&gt;' for 'begin bold,' '&lt;eb&gt;' for 'end bold,'" 
        Angie says, tongue in cheek, adding that, in fact, "these are quite 
        similar to html coding used for the web." That coded text was then 
        fed into the typesetting machines. "We actually wrote mini-programs 
        that told the machine what was happening on each page," she explains, 
        "stuff like 'begin format 1, x0, y0, delay text 150pp, ret, x16, 
        y0, delay text 150pp, ret' and so on. And because we didn't have 'What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get' 
        (WYSIWYG) screens, after we programmed a number of pages or chapters, 
        we would have to direct the text to the view screens. The text would fly 
        by until the page we designated appeared. I remember this one strange 
        editor who could actually catch a typo as the text was flying by on the 
        viewer. I think you may have heard of him . . . his name is Kim Mohan."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Angie 
        states that typesetting at that time was "actually quite an art form 
        -- and it involved math. We had a clear acetate that was printed with 
        1-pica squares, a pica being a unit of measurement, and we would actually 
        have to figure out how many picas to indent from the left (or right) for 
        each return, and we would compensate depending on the leading (the space 
        between words). In fact, I still have my typesetting calculator (base 
        12 and all that). I'm one of the last typesetters to always think in the 
        measurements units of picas and points." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
        Angie started at Wizards, she arrived well before most of her coworkers 
        from TSR had moved into the Seattle offices. "I came with disk after 
        disk of files in various stages of development," she recalls. "I 
        looked around and asked where my crew was. They told me I <i>was</i> the 
        crew." As if she weren't overwhelmed enough at the time, the projects 
        kept coming. "I remember being asked if I could lend a hand typesetting 
        cards. I politely declined (read: gaped in astonishment). Then I remember 
        being asked if I read everything I typeset. I politely smiled (read: gaped 
        in astonishment). Every time I printed a galley, someone would ask just 
        how many pages I was printing. Every time I printed a galley someone would 
        wonder aloud if I was 'printing a book' because it took up so much printer 
        time. I smiled politely (read: gaped in astonishment) and said, 'That's 
        what we do -- we print books.'"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The processes 
        have become far more streamlined, and now Wizards runs a fairly detailed 
        schedule of what the typesetters will be working on for the coming year, 
        so everyone is finally on the same page. "The schedule details the 
        turnover deadlines for each department involved in the RPG project," 
        Angie explains. "Typesetting likes to have all the pieces of the 
        project on the text-turnover date so that we can put out galleys for initial 
        review of the layout. This means that the art director has provided us 
        with a thumbnail or sketch, or printout with the 'look' of the product." 
        (This is usually a two-page spread and the specific chapter-start graphics.) 
        "The managing editor has given us the text -- usually in a Word file 
        -- mapping has sent us the maps, imaging has provided the art, and we 
        get to work." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Often, 
        editors provide the typesetters with storyboards on which they can base 
        their typesetting documents. These storyboards are thumbnails of what 
        the finished product will look like, and they detail how it lays out. 
        Often they include a title page, a legal or credits page, a table of contents, 
        an occasional introduction, and, finally, the consecutive chapters. Depending 
        on the length of the book, they may contain an index or ad at the end. 
        "We've also been experimenting with a more open storyboard approach," 
        Angie notes, "where the editor gives us a list of illustrations and 
        maps and their respective numbers and sizes, and the text is tagged in 
        the Word document to alert the typesetter where the illustrations will 
        fall. This technique has also worked pretty well."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time 
        is always a factor when the typesetting department begins a project, and 
        sometimes the typesetters must work under stress to get the project finished. 
        "Project Management is both our bane and our savior," Angie 
        admits. "They've done all the coordination to make sure we get our 
        materials on time, but they also encourage us to get it all done as quickly 
        as possible." Not surprisingly, in-house projects prove to be easier 
        than licensed products due to the length of time Wizards needs to obtain 
        licensor approvals; approval processes can often trim precious time out 
        of a typesetter's schedule. Fortunately, the typesetters aren't involved 
        much in those approval processes. "We don't work all that closely 
        with authors/designers of the product," Angie points out. "Most 
        of our contact is with editors and art directors. If we can keep those 
        groups pleased and meet project management's deadlines, then we're golden."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
        reviewing the nuts and bolts of what she does in typesetting, Angie asks, 
        "So . . . are you bored yet?"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
        more than thirteen years of typesetting behind her, Angie can see that 
        her projects have become progressively more complex as software and hardware 
        have evolved to handle it. "Our backgrounds are far more interesting, 
        for one thing," she points out. "And our line looks have become 
        more sophisticated. But complications still arise when pieces are missing. 
        For instance, we have a lot of projects that place art in the center of 
        the page and have runarounds. This is not a problem if the art and text 
        arrive at the same time, but if the art is late, then we can't properly 
        fit the text and have no idea whether the job fits. Printing requires 
        that books be set in sixteen-page increments. When text runs long or short 
        we have a problem." She adds that the upcoming <i><b>Call of Cthulhu</b></i> 
        <i>Roleplaying Game</i> has presented quite a typesetting challenge, but 
        revealing why would spoil the surprise of seeing it on the shelf. "But 
        wait until you see the page layouts," she says. "Wow!"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 
        the years, Angie has worked with some great designers and art directors, 
        but singles out some typesetting projects as favorites, projects like 
        the <b> Dark Sun </b> books and 
        <b> Planescape.</b></font> 
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<b>Planescape</b> 
        went together especially well," she says, "because it was a 
        project where everybody in the company gave his or her best work without 
        a lot of interference from VPs and special interests, and the result was 
        stunning. The art was some of the best that had ever been seen in the 
        RPG world up to that time; the maps were amazingly detailed and complex. 
        We had some of the coolest layouts --remember the little Modron flipbook? 
        -- and some of the best graphics. The art was complex and took ages to 
        print, so we had everybody working to figure out how to reduce print time. 
        The printer worked with our imaging tech to come up with low-res files 
        for the books that would work with the Scitex. On that project, everybody 
        put in 110 percent." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other 
        projects have offered slightly different challenges to typesetting. "The 
        oddest book I've set was a fast play rules for the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11510">Alternity</a></b><font color="#800080"> 
        </font>game," Angie recalls. "It was a pamphlet that read one 
        way for the GM, and if you turned it over it read another way for the 
        [player]. I actually designed the document so that half the pages were 
        upside down and flowed backward. You'd probably have to look at it in 
        order to understand. But it was fun at the time."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 
        end, typesetting is often a collaborative effort between the numerous 
        people involved in the process, and some of those team efforts stand as 
        Angie's favorite projects to have worked on. "I think Kim and Dave 
        actually edited most of the <b>Alternity </b>text in live Quark documents 
        that I fed them," she recalls. Her list of favorite projects includes 
        <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR09564">The Bestiary</a></i> (a <b>Dragonlance</b> 
        accessory)<font color="#800080">, </font>the creative looks for the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR06926">Marvel 
        Super Heroes</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR06926"> game</a> 
        and the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR02174">Ravenloft</a></b><font color="#800080"> 
        </font> realm, the accordion-fold manuals for the <b>Dragon Dice </b>game, 
        and the challenging 25th anniversary box for TSR. But one of the projects 
        that she's most proud of never saw the shelves.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We 
        worked so hard on the <b>Blood Wars</b> <i>Tactical Manual</i>," 
        she says. "I remember that the book had to go to print the next day. 
        The art was on so many separate CDs and the book was graphically complex 
        that I stayed at work until 4:30 in the morning printing the darn thing. 
        I got back to work around 9:00 that morning like a zombie to make sure 
        that all the sign-offs took place. And we got the book out on time. And 
        then the line was cancelled." She grins and sighs at the same time. 
        "I guess that's publishing for you."</font></p>
