        wanted to be an artist. My father was an artist, and we used to visit 
        the Cleveland Museum of Art when I was young," says Mark Jindra, 
        a Web developer at Wizards of the Coast. "That idea quickly changed 
        when I saw a television commercial advertising a starving artist sale 
        at a local hotel. I wasn't willing to starve to become an artist."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        Road to the Web</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
        his teen years, Mark became fascinated with computers and taught himself 
        to program both his Atari 800xl and his Commodore 64. "Then, when 
        it came time to go to college, I opted for a career as a computer programmer," 
        he says. But in the aftermath of college, his computer-related jobs were, 
        in his words, "unfulfilling"... until he stumbled upon the Web.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
        am lucky that, at those many jobs, I picked up skills in multimedia development 
        and some of the more modern programming languages and was easily able 
        to make the transition into Web development," he admits. These skills 
        landed him a quick stint constructing a website for a student organization 
        at a major college in Ohio. "It took me a few hours to build a five-page 
        informational website, and I made an easy couple hundred bucks. I remember 
        thinking, 'This is the kind of job I could really enjoy.'"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He was 
        already familiar with Wizards of the Coast long before coming to work 
        for the company -- he began gaming more than 20 years ago when his cousin 
        introduced him to <b>D&amp;D.</b> Later he founded his own play-by-mail 
        game company, where he did all of the programming and game design himself. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=gencon"><img src="2002%20-%2005-26%20-%20Web%20Developers_files/VGC_2_new.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="134" hspace="6" width="126"></a>"Prior 
        to coming to Wizards," he says, "I worked for a subsidiary of 
        Wizards of the Coast called Andon Unlimited. We ran conventions around 
        the Midwest including <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=http://www.originsgames.com/" target="_blank">Origins</a></b> 
        and even <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=gencon">Gen Con</a></b>. I was a longtime 
        friend of Andon founder Gary Smith, and when he needed a webmaster and 
        <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=rpga">RPGA</a> coordinator, I was there for him."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three 
        years after beginning work with Andon, Mark joined Wizards in September 
        of 1998 as part of the newly formed online media team. "All I can 
        remember about my first few days at Wizards is that I thought to myself, 
        'This must be the coolest place on earth,'" he says. "Well, 
        at least it was for gamer like myself."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He was 
        promptly put in charge of the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=community/welcome">Wizards 
        online community</a> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and 
        began work on a revision of the Wizards website.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>It's 
        "Like a Jigsaw Puzzle"</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, just 
        what does all that mean? What does a Web developer actually do? </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"'Web 
        developer' is just a big-business way of twisting the title of webmaster 
        into something less intimidating and mystifying to management," Mark 
        says. "I can sometimes be working on as many as twenty or thirty 
        projects -- what I mean by that is, I know the schedule of the next thirty 
        or so Web updates, and I keep in touch with the production team so as 
        to stay in the loop."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark's 
        projects are generally articles for the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=dnd/welcome,3">D&amp;D</a></b>,<font color="#800080"> </font><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=fr/welcome,3">Forgotten Realms</a></b>, 
        or <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=minis/welcome,3">Chainmail</a></b> websites, 
        but on occasion he works on projects for the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/wheeloftime/main.asp?x=welcome,3">Wheel 
        of Time </a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/wheeloftime/main.asp?x=welcome,3">Roleplaying 
        Game</a></i> or the d20 <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=cthulhu">Call of 
        Cthulhu </a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=cthulhu">Roleplaying Game</a></i> 
        pages. "The projects include development projects like generators 
        and calculators, as well as graphical 
        projects like <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article1.asp?x=dnd/ag/gallery,3">art galleries</a>," 
        Mark explains. "So far, I would have to say that the highlight of 
        my career at Wizards was developing the html version of the fast-play 
        rules for <b>D&amp;D</b> that are on the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=movie/mx20010518a">Dungeons 
        &amp; Dragons</a></b></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=movie/mx20010518a"> 
        movie DVD</a>."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The process 
        of developing, say, an article for the Official <b>D&amp;D</b> Website 
        is actually somewhat more complicated than you might think. First, a producer 
        offers a writing assignment to a game designer, and the article gets placed 
        on the web content schedule. When the article comes in, an editor does 
        a first pass on the piece to be certain it's ready for review by the <b>D&amp;D</b> 
        rules council. Once the article is finalized, it's returned to the producer, 
        along with any necessary information to guide the Web developer, such 
        as suggestions of images and artwork to use or links to add. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Web 
        developer then begins to pull all these pieces together "like a jigsaw 
        puzzle," Mark says. "I take the raw article and do all the [html] 
        markup, deciding what font sizes to use, how the graphics best fit with 
        the text, what if any special code needs to be written, and so on. Ultimately, 
        I act as a 'typesetter' and something of a graphic designer for the articles, 
        as I am the last stop for them before they are viewed by the public." 
        The Web producers at Wizards maintain a schedule detailing the status 
        of each article, and developers like Mark use that schedule from week 
        to week to monitor where their projects are at any given time.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
        most fun comes when someone decides to take a vacation and the schedule 
        needs to be moved up," he notes.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Wizards 
        Web</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The variety 
        of skills Mark needs to make this process function is impressive. "I 
        started Web programming by teaching myself html," he notes, "but 
        it seems that very little of what I do on a day-to-day basis has anything 
        to do with raw html anymore." There's a common misconception out 
        there that anyone with a little knowledge of html can be Web developer, 
        he notes. "To some extent this is true, but to do it for a living 
        is another story altogether. With the advent of hand-held and cellular 
        devices, the way that the data is marked up and stored [for online use] 
        has changed quite a bit.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"One 
        advantage of the way things are done in today's Web environment is that 
        content can be shared laterally between brands, even other sites. Web 
        pages can easily be served in a multi-language format without having to 
        create a separate site…. Our <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard">Sideboard</a></b></i> 
        website is a great example of this."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=fr/welcome,3"><img src="2002%20-%2005-26%20-%20Web%20Developers_files/Waterdeep_weather.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="209" width="214"></a>To 
        date, Mark has done quite a bit of Web work for Wizards. In addition to 
        challenging projects like the "<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/DnD_Regdar_End.asp">Join 
        Regdar</a>" promotion the company created for the launch of 3rd Edition 
        <b>D&amp;D</b> ("I learned quite a bit about programming in the Visual 
        Basic environment for that one.") and strange ones like the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/main.asp?x=fr/welcome,3">"Waterdeep 
        Weather" generator</a> for the <b>Forgotten Realms</b> pages ("It 
        does a lot behind the scenes to make sure that there's a weather prediction 
        for each day of the year."), he has also worked on the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=minis/ch20011225x">"<b>Chainmail</b> 
        Warband Generator,"</a> <font color="#800080"> </font>which evolves 
        constantly as new models are released. This, he concedes, is by far the 
        hardest project he's worked on yet.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
        projects under his belt like <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR02802">The 
        Externals</a></i>, an interactive browser-based product that Wizards did 
        for <b>Alternity</b>'s <b>Star*Drive</b> game, Mark can take great pride 
        in his accomplishments. It's not an easy field to work in, with so many 
        different demands on his skills. "Just about every reference in the 
        text of <i>The Externals </i>was linked to its key reference somewhere 
        else in the product," he explains. "It also included a dice 
        roller and online enhancements." Curious players can still find the 
        game at the <a href="http://store.wizards.com/product.asp?ProductID=3490" target="_blank">Wizards 
        online store</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What 
        Comes Next?</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, would 
        he ever consider leaving the Web development field? Possibly. He's already 
        written several articles for the <b>D&amp;D</b> website, including for 
        the "<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/mm/mm20010330a4">Monster Mayhem</a>" 
        and "<b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article1.asp?x=dnd/fc/fightclub,3">D&amp;D</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article1.asp?x=dnd/fc/fightclub,3"> 
        Fight Club</a>" columns, and he's currently spearheading support 
        for psionics in "<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article1.asp?x=dnd/psi/welcome,3">The 
        Mind's Eye</a>" feature. But the big screen might also lure Mark 
        into a new line of work. "I have always wanted to be involved in 
        some way with the motion picture industry, possibly in special effects. 
        Or the computer game industry as a designer/writer of computer games." 
        In the meantime, however, he's very happy with the field he's become an 
        expert in.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, what 
        advice would he offer someone looking to get into Web development? "You 
        should start early, learn the basics of html development on your own, 
        and get into an intern program before going on to college," he suggests. 
        "Learn as much about xml and xslt as well as multimedia development 
        in Flash and Shockwave as you can. The future of the Web seems to indicate 
        that programming in the .net environment will become a necessary skill 
        as well. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 
        hardest thing about the job is that it is always changing, but that may 
        also be the reason I enjoy it so much. Our online media team gets a considerable 
        amount of recognition from within the company itself, and occasionally 
        we get a letter from a fan that thanks us for the job we do -- it's days 
        like those that make the job worth doing."</font></p>
