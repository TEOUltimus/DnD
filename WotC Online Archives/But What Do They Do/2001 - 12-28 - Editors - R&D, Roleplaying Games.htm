        nearly ten years now, Michele Carter has been an RPG editor. In that decade, 
        she's worked on some extremely complicated projects -- the <b>Planescape</b> 
        boxed sets, for example (which contained, according to Michele, "about 
        a zillion components each"); <i>Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</i> ("extreme 
        map complexities"); the <i><b>Dark*Matter</b></i> <i>Campaign Setting</i> 
        ("a wholly new setting and a complete departure from anything we'd 
        done before"); the new <b>D&amp;D</b> edition of the <i><b>Forgotten 
        Realms</b></i> <i>Campaign Setting</i> ("balancing the history of 
        the line against the needs of the new game and the evolution of the setting"); 
        and the new version of <i>Deities and Demigods</i> ("deity stat blocks 
        -- enough said").</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
        of these more complicated projects have turned out to be her favorite 
        ones. And none of these have convinced her that she has anything less 
        than her dream job. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I 
        recognize just how lucky I am to be able to say that," she hastens 
        to point out. "How many people really love what they do for a living? 
        It's not all playing games -- there's an enormous amount of work that 
        goes into producing RPGs, and I spend a lot of weekends in the office 
        -- but it's fun."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As one 
        of the senior editors for the Roleplaying Games Division, Michele's time 
        and energy are often spread out among multiple projects, though she generally 
        tries to focus on only one of them at a time -- she tracks the progress 
        of her previous projects as they move through the production process, 
        she attends concept meetings for the next ones, and she keeps up with 
        other things around the department. "I've worked on most of the lines 
        we've published at one point or another," she says. "As a sample, 
        my last project was the new <i>Deities and Demigods</i> for the core <b>D&amp;D</b> 
        line; my current project is <i>Power of the Jedi</i> for <i>Star Wars</i>; 
        and my next one will be a massive <b>Forgotten Realms</b> adventure . 
        . . that I'm not allowed to talk about yet."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The editorial 
        process of bringing these projects to fruition has been a learning experience 
        from the very beginning of Michele's time with TSR. In 1991, the game 
        company placed an ad in <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i> advertising for 
        editorial positions on the roleplaying staff. "It was pure coincidence 
        that I happened to see it, because I wasn't reading <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i> 
        regularly at the time," Michele remembers. "But I loved gaming 
        and happened to be flipping through the issue when I saw the ad. I remember 
        the feeling very well: standing at the magazine rack, staring at the ad 
        and thinking, 'Yes. This is what I want to do with my life.' I went home 
        and immediately sent off my resume."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few 
        rounds of letters and phone calls later, she found herself traveling from 
        Florida to Wisconsin for an interview. "That was an amazing experience," 
        she says. "Walking around the old TSR building, I met these people 
        who had comic books piled up in their cubes, swords hanging on the walls, 
        action figures everywhere. There was a guy sprawled out on the floor, 
        drawing a map for an adventure. It was this wonderful creative madhouse 
        and I wanted to be a part of it." When TSR offered her a job in July 
        of 1992, she was more than willing to move on from the Public Administration 
        program she was enrolled in at grad school. "When I got the acceptance 
        phone call, the first thing I did was call my parents and tell them, 'I'm 
        moving to Wisconsin.' No hesitation at all, even considering the fact 
        that I'd grown up in southern Florida and had never seen snow. Now, <i>that</i> 
        was a shock. . . ."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her first 
        assignment was to work on <i>Assassin Mountain</i> by Wolfgang Baur, for 
        the <b>Al-Qadim</b> line. "I had no idea what I was doing," 
        she admits. "It was a really fascinating project, though, and I got 
        a lot of good advice from other editors in the department. It became immediately 
        apparent that the editor's job was far more than proofreading. We're responsible 
        for the entire project, start to finish. While my introduction was a little 
        like being thrown into the deep end of the pool, there was no better way 
        to learn how to edit RPGs than just to start doing it."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And what 
        does "just doing it" entail? In Michele's case, she's involved 
        in a project from start to finish, beginning with concept meetings even 
        before the designers have begun to write. At these meetings, the designer, 
        the editor, the creative director "and anyone else who's interested 
        in the project" weigh in with their thoughts about the upcoming project. 
        Then the designer is off to write. "Depending on the size of the 
        project, it might be months before the editor sees it again," Michele 
        points out, "though at varying times the designer might call for 
        additional input on concepts or story direction or other aspects."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
        the design phase is completed, the manuscript goes to the editor. "When 
        I get a manuscript, the first thing I do is look to make sure all the 
        pieces are in place," she explains. "That means consulting the 
        product brief, which has information on how many pages the project has, 
        its art and map allotment, and other technical details. Then I generally 
        read through the entire thing to familiarize myself not only with what 
        the text actually says, but how it flows as a project, how the graphics 
        will be integrated, and if it meets the goals set for the project. Is 
        it a good adventure? Does the sourcebook give all the necessary information 
        in a clear and interesting manner?"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Editing 
        an RPG, however, includes a great deal more than just the body text (though 
        Michele notes that the body text is usually the largest part); there's 
        also the cover copy, art order, map order, other special graphics needs, 
        and often additional material such as web enhancements. "The editor 
        makes sure all the pieces are in place and then delivered to the appropriate 
        departments: art order to the art director, map order to the cartography 
        department, and so on," Michele explains. </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"And 
        then I edit the text," she says. "That's a very simple statement 
        for a very complex process. Spelling, grammar, and general proofreading 
        is certainly a large part of it, but it also includes checking for consistency 
        both in world-details (is this village really where the text says it is?) 
        and technical elements (does this new spell magic item or trap work in 
        accordance with the "rules" set out for creating new spells 
        in the new <b>D&amp;D</b>?). Editors check for the overall feel of the 
        manuscript: Does it accomplish what it's supposed to? Does the text read 
        well, without too much passive voice? I'm responsible for all the printed 
        words that are read by thousands of people, so they'd better be the right 
        words." </font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        includes <i>all</i> the words, in fact -- from text on the back and front 
        covers to the microscopic legal text on the first page to the tags printed 
        on the maps and the captions under the art. Michele accounts for all of 
        this, in addition to practically everything else that goes into the product. 
        "Every art piece, for example, needs a description so that the art 
        director can tell the artists exactly what they need to draw," she 
        explains. "The art needs to be placed in reference to the text, without 
        too much art in one chapter and too little in another. The same process 
        applies to maps. Storyboards can be immeasurably useful here in detailing 
        how the final book will look. Page by page, I'll construct a storyboard 
        that includes every art and map that goes into the project, where the 
        chapter starts fall, and other specific details of the layout."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
        the editing is finished, the project moves on to the managing editor and 
        Michele begins the entire process over again for her next editorial assignment. 
        Yet even once the next project is underway, she still answers any questions 
        the managing editor has about the previous project, looks at the generated 
        art and maps to make sure they're correct in all details, and follows 
        up on any specific needs that the project requires as it goes through 
        the production process toward publication. "Every project is different, 
        and every editor works differently," Michele says. "This is 
        a unique job; it's both technical and creative. A strong grounding in 
        the use of language is essential, from spelling to grammar to punctuation. 
        Knowledge of the game worlds and rules is equally as important. Beyond 
        that, you learn about layout issues and production processes, how to assemble 
        a complete product and track its multitude of pieces. It's easy to look 
        at a single bound book and think of it as one work, but any number of 
        people have contributed to it, and it's up to the editor to pull it together 
        into a complete package."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In all, 
        Michele's career is not that far removed from where she had planned for 
        it to go in the first place. She acquired her B.A. in English, a field 
        she chose as her major "because I was good at it -- and because I 
        wasn't sure what I really wanted to do when I graduated. While I wasn't 
        interested in teaching or journalism (often assumed as career choices 
        for English majors), I knew it'd give me a strong background for whatever 
        I chose to do next. Those skills never go to waste." And they certainly 
        come up regularly in her work at Wizards of the Coast. It's been quite 
        a decade for her. Looking back, she can easily pick out those projects 
        that were the oddest ("the <i><b>Marvel</b> Dice Game</i>") 
        and those that were the most fun to work on. "The <b>Planescape</b> 
        line as a whole," she says. "That was very much a collaborative 
        effort between the designers and editors; we camped out in each others' 
        offices, discussing various aspects of the game world. Also the <i><b>Dark*Matter</b></i> 
        <i>Campaign Setting</i>, because of its unique needs and the time I spent 
        researching some truly odd material. There are some bizarre websites out 
        there."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All in 
        all, Michele feels she's been lucky enough to work on some of what she 
        considers to be the most innovative projects that TSR or Wizards of the 
        Coast has ever produced. "Early on, I got involved in the <b>Planescape</b> 
        product line and went on to edit a number of books for that setting. I 
        loved everything about it -- the concepts, the unconventional layouts, 
        the art. More recently, the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b></i> <i>Campaign 
        Setting</i>, which was a complex project for a number of reasons. I think 
        it turned out well.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"But 
        without a doubt, the project of which I'm most proud is the<i><b> Dark*Matter</b></i> 
        <i>Campaign Setting</i>. We had the chance to do something entirely different 
        with that book -- concepts and layouts and subjects we'd never touched 
        before. It was a vast project with an enormous scope, and it was absolutely 
        wonderful to work on with the designers and my co-editor, Andy Collins."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, 
        no matter how much they enjoy the work they've done to date, most editors 
        can cite an editing assignment that would be their ultimate editing experience. 
        Michele is no exception. "Of course, the comic-book fan in me would 
        love to edit those books that I enjoy the most," she admits. "It's 
        similar to what I do now: self-contained worlds constantly evolving with 
        input from multiple sources, with the editorial staff contributing not 
        only to the accuracy of the text and world-details but to the direction
