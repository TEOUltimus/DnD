<p align="LEFT">"I approached the great slumbering wyrm in an attempt to determine what type of dragon it might be. As I drew closer I could see the familiar translucent scales of a crystal dragon. Just then my torchlight reflected off of scales of a different sort, emerald green and a black like that of polished obsidian. As I followed the scales, I soon realized that this was no ordinary dragon. I quickly made my way back to the city so as to tell everyone of what I had seen." </p>
<p align="right"><i>-- Theo Boranis, Defender of Sardior </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Blithenpaxantadravos, a three-headed gem dragon, has had many monikers during his time. His name and titles have been spoken with both respect and contempt. Then, as time passed, they were simply forgotten. Now, he is just Blithen.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Blithen's abnormality is what first drew Sardior's attention. Sardior found him to be fascinating and eventually brought Blithen to his court. Sardior turned often to Blithen for help with a current problem, and soon Blithen earned his first title: Advisor. Blithen had the ear of a god, and he enjoyed it. For a time, it seemed Blithen was always at Sardior's side.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Then, it all changed. Sardior decided that Blithen's single voice was not enough, and he set upon developing the process to create his thanes. Sardior shared his vision with Blithen; he was to create a thane to represent each of the gem dragon species, and they would be his advisors and companions. It's uncertain how Blithen corrupted Seradess; the history is lost. Blithen had hoped her failure as a thane would cause Sardior to turn back to him, but this plan failed. Sardior destroyed Seradess, and the obsidian dragons withdrew from Sardior's court (although history records that Sardior banished the obsidian dragons from his court). Sardior discovered the deception and banished Blithen. He had earned his next title: Outcast.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Blithen wandered the planes for generations and used the color pools on the Astral Plane to visit new worlds and places. He eventually grew weary and decided to rest, so he created his lair on the Astral Plane and slipped into a deep slumber. He had earned his next title: Forgotten.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The energy used by Sardior to create the ectoplasmic dragons was enough to bring him out of his torpor. After assessing himself and his situation, he mentally sought a strong psion to find out the current state of the world. He didn't have to look long, for he was soon in contact with someone on the Astral Plane. To his surprise, the psion had quite an interesting tale to tell him. Blithen formed a pact and found his latest title: Nihilist.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>His Lair: </b>Blithen currently resides in the center of a giant rock floating on the Astral Plane. Blithen ripped a chunk from the Elemental Plane of Earth and brought it here. The cavern complex found within has become home to many creatures. A small city and trade center has grown up on the outer shell, and the inhabitants of the plane consider it a safe zone. Blithen has learned of the inhabitants since his reawakening but has not decided how to deal with them yet. Rumors state the treasure horde he guards rivals that of a nation's treasury.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Blithen's Psionics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Blithen once served as keeper of knowledge for Sardior himself. During that time he had access to research on powers the likes of which have not been seen in ages. It was during this time that he developed <i>Blithen's calling, </i>the power that Sardior later altered and passed on to his followers as <i>Sardior's calling </i>(<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20030926b">See Mind's Eye Article</a>). </p>
<p align="LEFT">It is believed that Blithen never passed on the knowledge of this power. A DM that wishes to allow its use in his campaign could introduce it a number of ways. Perhaps characters discover it via a power stone found in ancient treasure. Or Blithen himself may grant them the knowledge via a<i> psychic chirurgery</i> as a reward for completing a task. Ultimately it's up to you, the DM, to determine how best to do this. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blithen's Calling<br></b>Psychoportation (Dex) <br><b>Level: </b>Psion 9<br><b>Display:</b> Au, Ma, Vi<br><b>Manifestation Time:</b> 1 full round<br><b>Range:</b> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Effect:</b> See text <br><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> None<br><b>Power Resistance:</b> No<br><b>Power Points:</b> 17</p>
<p align="LEFT">You touch on the power of Blithen to call forth an adult gem dragon to aid you with an immediate task. If you know the name of the adult dragon, you can call upon it specifically; otherwise you get a random dragon. The task you choose is to have it fight for you or to perform actions that take no more than 1 minute per manifester level. In return, the dragon expects compensation. Normally this is coin, gems, or magic items in the amount of least 100 gp per Hit Die, but it can be some other form of barter as determined by you and the dragon (as determined by the DM). The chart below determines the type of random gem dragon called. The gem dragon is transported back to its lair when it desires. This is normally after the task is finished and payment received, but if it decides to leave before this, the gem dragon forfeits payment.</p>
