<p class="size2">As more and more<b> D&amp;D</b> supplements add to the feat selections of sorcerers, wizards, and other spellcasters, the psionic character's feat selection begins to pale, especially those specifically dealing with manifesting powers. Here is the remedy.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Augment Construction [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Manifester level 2nd+.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Astral constructs you create with the astral construct powers gain +1 hit point per Hit Die and a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Chain Power [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can manifest powers that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Any other metapsionic feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You can chain any power that specifies a single target and has a range greater than touch. The chained power affects that target (the primary target) normally, then arcs to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level. Each arc affects one secondary target. You choose the secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be affected more than once. You can affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum. </p>
<p class="size2">If the chained power deals damage, the secondary targets each take half as many dice of damage as the primary target (rounded down) and can attempt Reflex saving throws for half of the secondary damage. For powers that do not deal points of damage, the save DCs against arcing effects are reduced by 4. For example, a 16th-level psion manifests a chained baleful teleport on a nearby githzerai and can specify up to ten secondary targets. The githzerai, as primary target, must make a Will save against DC 17, while those affected by the secondary arcs save against DC 13.</p>
<p class="size2">A chained power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +6.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Extra Power [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Manifester level 3rd+.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You learn one additional power at any level up to one level lower than the highest-level power you can manifest. Thus, a 4th-level psion gains a new 0-level or 1st-level power, expanding his repertoire. A 4th-level psychic warrior can learn an extra 0-level power. You learn extra powers from your class power list.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, you learn a new power at any level up to one less than the highest-level power you can manifest.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fortify Power [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can manifest powers to greater effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> All variable, numeric effects of an fortified power are increased by one-quarter (minimum of 1). A fortified power deals an extra twenty-five percent damage, cures twenty-five percent as many hit points, affects twenty-five percent more targets, and so on, as appropriate. For example, a fortified lesser concussion deals twenty-five percent more damage (roll 1d6 and multiply the result by 1.25, with a minimum extra damage of 1). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the one you make when you manifest negate psionics) are not affected. Powers without random variables are not affected. A fortified power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost + 2. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can apply Fortify Power to the same power multiple times. Each time you apply it, the power is fortified another twenty-five percent, and it costs 2 more power points. For instance, a lesser concussion fortified 3 times deals 1d6 x 1.75 damage for a cost of 7 power points. You can't break the power point limit of the manifester level minus one when using Fortify Power multiple times on the same power. Thus, an 8th-level manifester could have used the power as described in the above example, while a 7th-level caster could not, though he could use Fortify Power twice on lesser concussion so that it deals 1d6 x 1.5 damage, for a cost of 5 power points.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Mind Blind [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">Your mind becomes partially closed off to psionic combat. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite: </b>Psychic Bastion.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You permanently gain a mental hardness of 3. This mental hardness stacks with mental hardness provided by Psychic Bastion and psionic defense modes. However, your partially closed-off mind also inhibits your use of psionic attack modes -- all your psionic attack modes are assessed a -3 ability damage penalty (minimum damage 1).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Power Specialization [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites: </b>Weapon Focus (ray), Manifester level 4th+.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Your damage-dealing powers that require a ranged touch attack gain a +2 damage modifier. For instance, finger of fire is considered a ray power. The damage bonus only applies if the target is within 30 feet, because only at that range can you strike precisely enough to hit more effectively.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Psionic Defense [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Add +2 to your saving throws against powers of a chosen discipline.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new psionic discipline.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Psionic Energy Substitution [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can modify a power that uses one type of energy to use another type of energy.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Any other metapsionic feat, 5 ranks in Knowledge (psionics).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can modify a power with an energy designator to use the chosen type of energy instead. A substituted power works normally in all respects except the type of damage dealt.</p>
<p class="size2">A substituted power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost (there is no extra cost), modified by any other metapsionic feats.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times, each time it applies to a different type of energy.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Psionic Energy Admixture [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can modify a power that uses one type of energy to mix in an equal amount of another type of energy.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Psionic Energy Substitution (one other), one other metapsionic feat, 5 ranks in Knowledge (psionics).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Choose one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic for which you already have selected for the Psionic Energy Substitution feat. You can modify a power with an energy designator to add an equal amount of the chosen type of energy. The altered power works normally in all respects except for the type of damage dealt. For instance, a sonic admixtured firefall would deal 5d4 points of sonic damage and 5d4 points of fire damage.</p>
<p class="size2">Even opposed types of energy, such as fire and cold, can be combined using this feat. An admixed power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +8.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times, choosing a different type of energy each time. You can use Psionic Energy Admixture to further alter a power that has already been modified with Psionic Energy Substitution. You can also use Psionic Energy Admixture to include your chosen energy type with a power that already uses the same type, in effect doubling the damage dice.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Reach Power [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can manifest a power with a range of "touch" at a distance.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Enlarge Power.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You can manifest a power that normally has a range of "touch" at any distance up to 25 feet. The power effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed at a ranged touch attack to bestow the power upon a recipient.</p>
<p class="size2">A reach power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +2.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Repeat Power [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can manifest a power that repeats the following round.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Any other metapsionic feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> A repeated power is automatically manifested again at the beginning of your next turn. No matter where you are, the second power originates from the same location and affects the same area as the original power. You cannot use this feat on powers with a touch range. If the original power designates a target, the repeated power affects the same target if it is within 30 feet of its original position; otherwise the second power fails.</p>
<p class="size2">A repeated power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +6.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Resculpt Mind [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Psion only, manifester level 3rd+</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Instead of gaining a new psionic combat mode when you go up a level, you instead choose any metapsionic feat, gaining it as a bonus feat. You now choose to gain a metapsionic feat or a psionic combat mode at each level you normally qualify for a new psionic combat mode (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th).</p>
<p class="size2">You still have the option of gaining four of the five the psionic combat modes you gave up for bonus metapsionic feats, at levels 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th, respectively. You may not give up psionic combat modes for bonus metapsionic feats at these higher levels.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sculpt Power [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can alter the shape of a power's area.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Any other metapsionic feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You can modify an area power by changing the area's shape. The new area must be chosen from the following list: cylinder (10-foot radius, 30 feet high), 40-foot cone, four 10-foot cubes, or a ball (20-foot-radius spread). The sculpted power works normally in all respects except for its shape. For example, a firefall power whose area is changed to a cone deals the same amount of damage, but the firefall affects a 40-foot cone burst. </p>
<p class="size2">A sculpted power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +2.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Split Psionic Ray [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can affect two targets with a single ray.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisites: </b>Any other metapsionic feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You can split powers that specify a single target and require a ranged touch attack. Only powers that deal damage can be affected by this feat. The split ray affects any two targets that are both within the power's range and within 30 feet of each other. Each target takes half as much damage as normally indicated (round down). If desired, you can have both rays attack the same target.</p>
<p class="size2">A split ray costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost (there is no extra cost), modified by any other metapsionic feats.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Upgrade Power [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Any other psionic or metapsionic feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Choose one power chain from which you have learned a psionic power. When you learn a higher-level power on that chain, you can "forget" one or more lower-level powers you know on the chain, substituting new, different powers of the same lower level instead. If you "forget" a lower-level power and that is the only power you know from your discipline at that level, you must substitute another power from your discipline at that level. You can choose not to "forget" a lower-level power you know, even if learning a higher-level power on a chain for which you have chosen this feat. Recognized power chains are described in the Recognized Power Chains sidebar -- other power chains may be possible (or the recognized power chains may be altered), at your DM's discretion.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies to a new power chain.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Widen Power [Metapsionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can increase the area of your powers.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Any other metapsionic feat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit: </b>You can alter a burst, emanation, or spread power to increase its area. Powers that do not have an area of one of these three sorts are not affected by this feat. Any numeric measurements of the power's area increase by one-half. For example, a widened whitefire power (which normally produces a 20-foot-radius spread) now fills a 30-foot-radius spread. A widened power costs a number of power points equal to its standard cost +6.</p>
