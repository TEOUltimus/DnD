The first feat, Advanced Construction, allows you to extend the list of abilities that your astral constructs can use, and it introduces new, more powerful Menu D selections as well. The second feat, Ecto Manipulation, allows you to trade in abilities for selections from a higher menu and gives you access to the new Menu D. The third feat, Extended Construction, increases the duration of your astral constructs to minutes instead of rounds. The fourth feat, Enhanced Construction, increases the number of constructs that you create every time you manifest an <i>astral construct</i> power. The fifth and final feat, Infused Construction, allows you to increase your metapsionic cap for the purposes of manifesting <i>astral construct</i> powers. Finally, we bring you four new astral construct themed psionic items for your enjoyment.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Advanced Construction [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can choose special abilities for your construct from an extended list.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Augment Construction.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> You can add new special abilities to the list of special abilities from which you can choose when manifesting astral constructs. When you take this feat, you can select from Table 1-1: Advanced Construction Special Abilities a number of Menu A special abilities that equal twice your manifester level. When you make a selection, that ability is permanently added to the selection from which you can choose when manifesting astral constructs. For each manifester level that you gain, you can select two additional special abilities from Menu A. You can trade in two selections from Menu A for one selection from Menu B. You can elect to postpone your selections until you gain another level. If you have postponed a selection from an earlier level, you can trade in four Menu A selections for one selection from the Menu C. If you have postponed selections so that you have eight Menu A selections available, you can trade them for a selection from the D menu. </p>

<p class="size2"><b>Table 1-1: Advanced Construction Special Abilities</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Menu A</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Brawn (Ex):</i></b> Construct does an additional +1 point of damage on a successful melee attack. (Multiple selections stack, and you cannot select this ability more than 8 times.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Claws (Ex):</b></i> The construct has razor sharp claws. Attacks are now considered claw attacks instead of slams. Damage from these claw attacks is 1d8 + Strength modifier. The claw attacks are considered slashing or piercing weapons. The type is chosen when the construct is manifested. (If the construct has the extra arms ability, this ability must be chosen twice to affect both sets of arms.) </p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Cleave (Ex):</b></i> The cleave extraordinary ability works as the Cleave feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str 13+, Power Attack), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either. </p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Dodge (Ex):</b></i> The dodge extraordinary ability works as the Dodge feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Dex 13+), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either. </p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Improved Bull Rush (Ex):</b></i> The improved bull rush extraordinary ability works as the Improved Bull Rush feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str 13+, Power Attack), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Power Attack (Ex):</b></i> The power attack extraordinary ability works as the Power Attack feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str 13+), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either. </p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Spiked Armor (Ex):</i></b>The construct's body is covered in spikes. The spikes allow the construct to deal 1d6 points of piercing damage (x2 critical) with a successful trample, squeeze, bull rush, or grapple attack. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Menu B</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Astral Repair (Ex):</i></b> The astral construct heals 2 hit points each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Carapace (Ex):</b></i> The construct's surface forms hard, armorlike plates. The construct gains a damage reduction of 10/+1. This replaces any damage reduction the construct might already have.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Energy Touch (Ex):</b></i> The construct's physical attacks do 1d4 points of energy damage (fire, cold, electricity, sonic, acid) in addition to their standard damage. The type of energy is chosen when the construct is manifested. (Multiple selections stack and may be of different energy types. You cannot select this ability more than 5 times.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Extra Arms (Ex):</b></i> The construct has an additional set of arms and can make an additional attack with an attack bonus equal to its highest attack bonus -2. (A construct with squeeze or rend can use that ability with these arms, as well.) This ability cannot be chosen more than once.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Expertise (Ex):</b></i> The expertise extraordinary ability works as the Expertise feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Int 13+), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Great Cleave</b><b>(Ex):</b></i> The great cleave extraordinary ability works as the Great Cleave feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Str +13, Power Attack, Cleave, base attack bonus +4 or higher), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Improved Critical (Ex):</b></i> The improved critical extraordinary ability works as the Improved Critical feat, and though no prerequisites are required (proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8 or higher), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Improved Fly (Ex):</b></i> Construct has physical wings (12-foot wingspan) and a speed of 120 feet (average). (This is similar to the power in the <i>Psionics Handbook</i>, though slower.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Improved Swim (Ex):</b></i> Construct becomes streamlined and sharklike with a large (8-foot-wide) tail. Its speed is 120 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Mobility</b><b>(Ex):</b></i> The mobility extraordinary ability works as the Mobility feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Dex 13+, Dodge), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Poison Touch (Ex):</b></i> The construct is covered in a shimmering purple liquid. If the construct hits with a melee attack, the target must make an initial Fortitude save (DC 15) or take 1d2 points of temporary Wisdom damage. A minute later, the target must save again (Fortitude save DC 15) or lose 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Reach</b><b>(Ex):</b></i> The construct's arms elongate, which increases its reach by 5 feet. (If the construct has the extra arms ability, this ability must be chosen twice to affect both sets of arms.) </p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Spike Volley (Ex):</i></b>The construct can send forth a volley of 3 spikes as a standard action. This ranged attack has a range of 120 feet with no range increment. These spike attacks are treated as thrown weapons, so the construct's Strength bonus is applied to damage (see page 97 of the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for more on thrown weapons). Damage is 1d6 + Strength modifier per spike. The construct can use this attack up to three times. (The construct must have the spiked armor ability to use this attack.) This volley can be fired in any direction (including straight up) regardless of the direction the construct is facing.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Stunning Fist</b><b>(Ex):</b></i>The stunning fist extraordinary ability works as the Stunning Fist feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Dex 13+, Improved Unarmed Strike, Wis 13+, base attack bonus +8 or higher), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Tough (Ex):</b></i> The construct receives 7 hit points per die, instead of 5.5 per die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Menu C</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Ectoplasmic Form (Sp):</b></i> The construct manifests <i>ectoplasmic form</i> as a standard action. </p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Hardened Carapace (Ex):</i></b> The construct's surface forms hard, armorlike plates. The construct gains a damage reduction of 15/+2. This replaces any damage reduction the construct might already have.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Power Resistance (Ex):</b></i> The construct gains a power resistance of 5 + the construct's Hit Dice. This ability can be chosen multiple times and adds 5 to the power resistance of the construct. For example, choosing this ability three times for an <i>astral construct IX</i> would give a total power resistance of 34 (19 + 5 + 5 +5 = 34)</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Rend (Ex):</b></i> A construct that hits with its claw attack does an additional 2d6 + 1.5 times its Strength modifier points of damage. (It must also have the claws ability; see entry above. A construct cannot use squeeze and rend in the same round.)</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Spike Flurry (Ex):</i></b>The construct can send forth a hail of spikes as a standard action. The attack is a cone shape with a range of 60 feet. Anyone caught in the flurry is immediately struck by 2d4 spikes that deal 1d6 damage each. A successful Reflex save (DC 13) halves the damage. This attack can be used only once. (The construct must have the spiked armor ability to use this attack.)</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Spring Attack</b><b>(Ex):</b></i> The spring attack extraordinary ability works as the Spring Attack feat, and though no prerequisites are required, constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Tail Slap (Ex):</b></i> The construct has a tail and gains one additional slam attack with an attack bonus equal to its highest attack bonus -2, and it deals damage of 2d8 + 1.5 times its Strength modifier (A construct cannot have a tail if it has extra arms.) </p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Tougher (Ex):</b></i> The construct receives 8.5 hit points per die, instead of 5.5 per die.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Whirlwind Attack</b><b>(Ex):</b></i> The whirlwind attack extraordinary ability works as the Whirlwind Attack feat, and though no prerequisites are required (Int 13+, Expertise, Dex 13+, Dodge, Mobility, base attack bonus +4 or higher, Spring Attack), constructs do not get the benefits from the prerequisites, either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Menu D </b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Amplified Invisibility (Sp):</i></b> The construct manifests <i>amplified invisibility</i> (self only) as a standard action.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Extra Hard Carapace (Ex):</b></i> The construct's surface forms hard, armorlike plates. The construct gains a damage reduction of 20/+3. This replaces any damage reduction the construct might already have.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Mass Concussion (Sp): </b></i>The construct manifests <i>mass</i><i>concussion</i> as a free action 3 times per day.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Super Buff (Ex):</b></i> The construct gains 17d10 temporary hit points. Multiple selections do not stack.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Toughest (Ex):</b></i> The construct receives 10 hit points per die, instead of 5.5 per die.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Ultraheavy Armor (Ex):</b></i> The construct gains a +10 deflection bonus to AC.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Ecto Manipulation [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You can manifest a more powerful astral construct at the expense of flexibility. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Manifester level 3rd+, Augment Construction.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> When you manifest an astral construct, you can trade in two abilities from the same menu for an ability from the next highest menu. For example when manifesting <i>astral construct VI</i> you can trade in two Menu B selections for a single Menu C selection. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Extended Construction [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You gain an increased duration on your manifested astral constructs.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Manifester level 3rd+, Augment Construction, Ecto Manipulation.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Astral constructs that you manifest have a duration of 1 minute per manifester level instead of their normal duration. For example a 13th-level psion manifests <i>astral construct VI</i>, creating a single type VI construct with a duration of 13 minutes</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Enhanced Construction [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">When you manifest constructs, you create additional constructs.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Manifester level 6th+.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> When you manifest constructs, you create additional bonus constructs. You create 1d3 bonus constructs of at least two levels below the <i>astral construct</i> power you are manifesting. For example, when a 13th-level psion manifests <i>astral construct VI,</i> she not only gets to choose the construct that normally manifests with the spell, but she also receives 1d3 constructs of her choice of type from I to IV. </p>

<p class="size2"><b>Infused Construction [Psionic]</b></p>
<p class="size2">You increase your metapsionic cap and can spend more power points manifesting astral constructs that are modified by metapsionic feats than would normally be possible. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Manifester level 6th+.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Your metapsionic cap is increased to a number of power points equal to your manifester level + 2 for purposes of manifesting astral constructs. For example, a 13th-level psion with a metapsionic cap of 12 would have that cap raised to 15 for purposes of manifesting astral constructs.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat beyond the first, you can add 2 power points to the metapsionic cap for purposes of manifesting astral constructs. Your new cap cannot exceed double your base metapsionic cap. For example, a 13th-level psion who has taken this feat 3 times can spend her normal 12 power points plus an additional 7 power points for a total of 19 power points. This would allow her to manifest <i>astral construct VI</i>, with the metapsionic feat Maximize Power applied to it (11 + 6 = 17 power points) that she could not normally have manifested with the standard metapsionic cap of manifester level - 1 (13 - 1 = 12 power points).</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Psionic Items</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Amulet of Advanced Construction:</b> When worn, the<i> amulet of advanced construction</i> grants the wearer additional special abilities from which he or she can select when manifesting astral constructs. These menu items must be from the table provided in the Advanced Construction feat. When crafted, the selections are set in the amulet and can consist of either 4 Menu A selections, 2 Menu B selections, or 1 Menu C selection.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Manifester Level:</i> 14th;<i> Prerequisites:</i> Craft Universal Item, Advanced Construction, <i>Astral Construct VII</i>;<i> Market Price:</i> 10,000 gp;<i> Weight:</i> --. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gloves of Ecto Manipulation:</b><i>Gloves of ecto manipulation</i> are thin leather gloves that are very flexible and are usually adorned with several small gemstones. When worn, they grant the wearer the ability to manipulate astral constructs as the Ecto Manipulation feat.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Crystalline Construct: </b>A crystalline construct is a small crystal figurine that resembles a tiny astral construct. When placed on the ground, and when a command word is spoken, the crystal animates into an astral construct as per the <i>astral construct V</i> power. The construct has the same menu choices each time it is summoned, and the figurine resembles the final construct form. It obeys the commands of the owner.</p>
<p class="size2">If the <i>crystalline construct </i>figurine is broken, the power within it is lost. If the construct is destroyed or dismissed while activated, it reverts back into the figurine. The construct can be brought forth once per day for 10 rounds. The figurine has an AC of 7, 6 hit points, hardness of 8, and a break DC of 20.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Sling Bullets of the Construct: </b><i>Sling bullets of the construct</i> appear to be sling bullets made of crystal instead of lead. They do normal sling bullet damage and have a +1 enhancement bonus to hit. Upon striking a target, the sling bullet brings forth a single astral construct that immediately begins to attack the target. Typically, 2-5 bullets are found.</p>
