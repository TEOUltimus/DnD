<p class="size2"><i>Based on an article by Arthur W. Collins in </i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine <i>#37</i><i><br> With inspiration and testing provided by members of the Wizards of the Coast online community</i></p>
<p align="CENTER"><b><img border="0" src="./2003 - 01-24 - The Legend of Sardior_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" width="570" height="9"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><i><img border="0" src="./2003 - 01-24 - The Legend of Sardior_files/dragon_37_med.jpg" width="177" height="215" align="right">Many have heard the tales of legendary dragons such as Tiamat and Bahamut, but few have heard of Sardior. Also known as </i>Master of the Gem Dragons, <i>Sardior is a unique ruby dragon. He makes his home in a huge floating castle, which orbits the world and stays forever in the shadows from the sun. Even though he is the Master of the Gem Dragons, in reality he does not require much from them, and he does not try to guide their decisions. The gem dragons in return, look upon him as the ideal and strive to be more like him. </i></p>
<p class="size2">Sardior keeps a court of five thanes: one of each of the various breeds of gem dragons. Their names are Aleithilithos (male advanced amethyst dragon), Hrodel (female advanced crystal dragon), Smargad (male advanced emerald dragon), Charisma (female advanced sapphire dragon), and Tithonnas (male advanced topaz dragon). Sardior once had a sixth thane: Seradess, a female advanced obsidian dragon, but he destroyed her and banished the obsidian dragons from his court. Even his own clergy argue the reason behind this decision. </p>
<p class="size2">Having ascended to the status of a lesser deity, temples to Sardior have begun showing up in cities across the land. Sardior is more than happy to oblige them by granting spells and special abilities to his followers. Sardior's clergy tend to be welcomed everywhere much as bards are, however they know not everyone is as friendly as they seem. A small group of his clergy, known as the ruby disciples, train to be a martial arm of the church, serving not only as a defense but also as a show of force.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sardior<br></b><b>The Ruby Dragon, Master of the Gem Dragons<br></b><b>Lesser Deity<br></b><b>Symbol: </b>A ruby with an inner glow<br><b>Home Plane: </b>Prime<br><b>Alignment: </b>Neutral<br><b>Portfolio: </b>Neutral dragons, night, psionics, secrets<br><b>Worshippers: </b>Neutral dragons, psions and psychic warriors<br><b>Cleric Alignments: </b>Any neutral.<br><b>Domains: </b>Knowledge, Scalykind (<i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting</i>), Trickery<br><b>Favored Weapon: </b>Claw</p>
<p class="size2">Sardior (<i>sar- </i>dee-or) is known in a few small circles. Even though he is the Master of the Gem Dragons, in reality he does not require much from his followers, and he does not try to guide their decisions. The gem dragons, in return, look upon him as the ideal and strive to be more like him.</p>
<p class="size2">In his natural form, Sardior is a long sinewy dragon covered with deep ruby red scales. At a distance, he might be mistaken for an ancient red wyrm, but the playful expression seen in his eyes makes him very much unlike the reds. He is also known to be a great conversationalist, and the unguarded had best be prepared for his sharp wit.</p>
<p class="size2">He makes his home in a huge floating castle, which orbits the world and stays forever in the shadows from the sun. On the nights it can be seen, viewers mistake it for a small red moon.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dogma</b></p>
<p class="size2">Sardior just wants to learn more. The more you know, the better off you will be, but just learning for learning's sake is not what Sardior stresses. No, gaining knowledge should not just be reading from books. The trick for Sardior is to get someone else to read the book, then tell him all about it. He also has a fondness for gems of all kinds, especially rubies.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Clergy and Temples</b></p>
<p class="size2">Sardior has few clergy, and even fewer temples. Temples dedicated to him tend to be located in high areas with clear views of the night sky and close to a community of some sort. Most gem dragons keep a ruby on a small pedestal in their lairs as a shrine to him.</p>
<p class="size2">His clergy generally dress in the appropriate fashion for the area in which they reside. They then embellish the look with an abundance of jewelry in their everyday wear. </p>
<p class="size2">Many seek out the clergy as sources of knowledge, and most of the clergy could be considered sages on various subjects. The temple gains its wealth from the charges from these services.</p>
<p class="size2">The prominent members of a temple are also on the list for an invitation to social functions. They are personable, knowledgeable, and great storytellers. They also appear to have little interest in politics, which makes those around them less concerned with the information they reveal to the clergy.</p>

<p class="size2"><b><i>Amethyst Telekinesis</i> (Sp): </b>Once per day, Aleithilithos can use a telekinesis effect. With this ability, he can lift up to 10 tons or hurl a Huge or smaller creature against another object. The impact deals 25d6 points of damage to a Huge creature, 20d6 to a Large one, 15d6 to a Medium-size one, 10d6 to a Small one, 5d6 to a Diminutive one, or 1d6 to a Fine one.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Breath Weapon (Su): </b>Aleithilithos can breathe a 140-foot line of force that deals 28d8 points of damage (Reflex DC 42 half). He can choose to deal subdual damage instead of normal damage if desired.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Crush (Ex): </b>Aleithilithos can land on foes as a standard action, using his whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Large or smaller. A crush attack affects as many creatures as Aleithilithos can fit under his body. Each creature in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 42) or be pinned automatically; taking 4d8+24 points of damage each round until Aleithilithos moves.

<p class="size2"><b><i>Explosive Gem</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, Aleithilithos can spit a violet, crystalline lozenge up to 75 feet away with pinpoint accuracy.

<p class="size2"><b>Frightful Presence (Su): </b>This ability takes effect automatically when Aleithilithos attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 420 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer than 45 Hit Dice. A potentially affected creature that succeeds at a Will save (DC 39) remains immune to Aleithilithos's frightful presence for 24 hours.

<p class="size2"><b>Tail Sweep (Ex): </b>As a standard action, Aleithilithos can sweep his tail in a half circle with a 40-foot diameter. Each Medium-size or smaller creature within the tail sweep area automatically takes 2d8+24 points of damage and must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 42) to avoid being knocked down.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blindsight (Ex): </b>Aleithilithos can ascertain his surroundings by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing vibration and other environmental clues). This ability enables him to discern objects and creatures within a range of 420 feet. Aleithilithos usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of his blindsight.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Force Resistant (Ex): </b>Aleithilithos gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against force-based effects such as <i>magic missile.</i></p>

<p class="size2">*Notes about Seradess: Sometime in the past, Sardior destroyed Seradess and banished the obsidian dragons from his court. Sages, and even his own clergy, argue the reason behind this decision. Did he banish the obsidian dragons because they had become evil, or did they become evil because of his choice? In any case, the other gem dragons shun the obsidian dragons, and meetings between them usually lead to conflict. It's still within Sardior's power to bring back Seradess, if he chooses to do so.</p>
