<p align="LEFT">The <i><a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953747200">Players Handbook II</a></i> introduces us to expanded classes, which provide us with a way to enhance the basic classes of <b>D&amp;D</b> . In this series, we present some expanded class options for the base psionic classes detailed in the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> .</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT" class="size3"><b>Expanded Class: Psion (Egoist)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img border="0" src="./2007 - 03-14 - The Mind's Eye - Expanded Classes, Part 02_files/dx20070314_mindseye_classes2.jpg" width="240" height="318" align="right">You are a very physical person, but at the same time you use your mental faculties to enhance your physical self beyond normal limits. You can use your abilities to become another person, another race, or even another creature. You are a believer in self-improvement, always seeking ways to become stronger, faster, and better. As such, you believe that everyone has the ability to change and grow beyond what they are at the moment. You are the person most likely to allow an enemy the chance at redemption or at least an opportunity for atonement. You tend to expect others to seek the same self improvement that you strive for, and that can get on others' nerves, but you realize that is just another area in which they need improvement.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one):</i><b></b> Ascetic, Drifter, Gladiator, Soldier, Tribal Origin.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one): </i> Challenger, Daredevil, Mercenary, Savage, Trickster.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or more of the following character themes could apply to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bio-Sculptor:</b> For you, physical perfection outweighs all other considerations. You work out with exercises, go running and swimming to keep yourself in shape, but also use your psionic ability to push yourself to limits others can only dream of. You can surge your physical and mental abilities, plus you can alter your form to walk on water, cling to walls and adapt to almost any environment. You are always looking for the next challenge to overcome, the next opponent to defeat, and the next opportunity to improve yourself.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"No, I am not strong enough . . . but now I am."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Feral Fighter: </b> You are a fighter and you have learned to unleash the beast within to assist you in your fighting. You start off with tooth and claw, but you one day hope to transform into fearsome creatures that will haunt your enemies' nightmares. You revel in your beast forms and the savagery that comes with them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"If you think these claws are impressive, wait till I show you what creature they came from."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Healer:</b> Perhaps you lost someone dear to you, or maybe you almost died but were saved because someone knew how to heal you. Regardless of how things happened, you find that you prefer to focus on healing others. You are sensitive to the suffering of those around you and will do whatever is necessary to alleviate pain. While you possess skills in many different types of healing, from basic tending of wounds to using herbs and natural cures, you find that when you unlock access to the psionic mantle of healing that you feel like more of a true healer.</p>
<table align="right" width="240" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#999999"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td><b>Minor Change Shape (Su):</b> Changelings have the supernatural ability to alter their appearance as though using a <i>disguise self</i> spell that affects their bodies but not their possessions. This ability is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of a changeling's facial features, skin color and texture, and size, within the limits described for the spell. A changeling can use this ability at will, and the alteration lasts until she changes shape again. A changeling reverts to her natural form when killed. A <i>true seeing</i> spell reveals her natural form. When using this ability to create a disguise, a changeling receives a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. Using this ability is a full-round action.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"First you have burns, now broken bones. After I heal you, perhaps you should stay away from both ends of the dragon this time?"</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shapeshifter: </b> You are rarely what you appear to be, even to the point of rarely showing your true personality. You could use altered forms to hide your confidence games by taking on a different appearance each time you work. You could be a gladiator, using exotic forms to excite the crowd. Or you could just be a master of many forms, seeking understanding by becoming that which you seek to know.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"You would treat your horse better if you knew just how much that bit hurts."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Change Shape</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b></b> You gain the minor change shape ability, like that of a changeling.<br><b>Level: </b> 1st.<br><b>Replaces:</b> The bonus feat at 1st level.<br><b>Benefit:</b> You gain the minor change shape ability that is possessed by changelings.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Life Mantle </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Granted Ability:</b> If you expend your psionic focus as a swift action as you manifest a power from this mantle, your manifester level for that power is considered 1 higher (thus increasing the number of power points you can spend on the power, among other benefits).</p>

<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT" class="size3"><b>Expanded Class: Psion (Kineticist)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You are a hyperactive powerhouse just full of energy. Nothing about you is subtle -- your clothing, style of speech, and actions all gain attention. You make a grand entrance, remain in the spotlight all evening, and then make an unforgettable exit. You feel a need to be in every conversation, to be part of every plan, and to have a hand in every project. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one): </i> Artisan, Gladiator, Guttersnipe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one): </i> Agent, Mercenary, Orphan, Renegade, Wanderer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Animator: </b> You bring the inanimate to life, projecting your will into objects, elements, and even organic forms. Unlike a shaper, you are not interested in the artistic merit of your work, just that it does what you tell it do. And you do not limit your manipulations to just your powers, since you tend to have a "user" personality, making use of all the people around you to your benefit as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"You have me alone? Why, yes, it is just me here, and a table and four chairs. . . ."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Energist:</b> You manipulate energy the way others weave cloth. You call forth lightning from the still air, create fire or ice with a thought, or unleash sound in a destructive scream. You are a very energetic person -- easy to excite or anger and quick to strike at those who do anger you. Your clothing is bright and some would say garish, as is your choice in food and entertainment. You never blend in with the crowd, unless that crowd is an out-of-control bar fight.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Okay, if fire does not work, let's try a little lightning."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Force Weaver:</b> You are a master of telekinesis, and you manipulate force into a field and use it to move objects, shield yourself and others, or unleash an incredible concussive force. To you, force is a pure energy and not as messy as fire or as unpredictable as electricity. You can even strike at those untouchable by normal means, such as ghosts. You are most likely artistic, practicing your telekinetic skills on clay or learning to fold paper into origami shapes by will alone.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Ghosts do not scare those who cannot be touched by them."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Savant:</b> Where others unleash massive energies into the world, you know how to shut them down, dispelling their psionic energies, dampening those fires, and just resisting all powers manifested against you. You are all about control and you expect all others to control themselves. If they do not, you will have to do it for them. You are most likely a city officer in charge of keeping order, especially among adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"You will learn to respect my authority."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Energy Snap</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can manifest a small burst of energy.<br><b>Level: </b> 1st.<br><b>Replaces:</b> The bonus feat at 1st level.<br><b>Benefit:</b> By expending your psionic focus, you can create a small burst of energy. You can use it as a weapon; treat it as a psi-like ability and consider it a 1st-level power for power resistance. You have to succeed on a melee touch attack as you expend your focus and, if successful, it does 1d3 points of damage of the type of energy manifested.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This ability is used more often on objects for other effects, depending on the type of energy manifested, and you must expend your psionic focus every time you use it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fire:</b> This can warm food, provide a distraction, and of course start a fire.<br><b>Cold: </b> This can chill food or a drink, make sure a campfire is out, and numb a bruise.<br><b>Electricity:</b> This can give someone a jolt, startle an animal, or start a fire.<br><b>Sonic: </b> This can startle someone up close or get someone's attention from far away.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greater Animator</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can animate much larger objects.<br><b>Level: </b> 5th.<br><b>Replaces: </b> The bonus feat at 5th level.<br><b>Prerequisite:</b> You must know the <i>control object</i> power.<br><b>Benefit: </b> Your <i>control object</i> power gains the following augmentation.<br><b>Augment: </b> For each additional power point you spend, you can target an object weighing an additional 25 lbs.</p>

<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT" class="size3"><b>Expanded Class: Psion (Nomad)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You are always moving -- in fact, you seem to have trouble standing still for even 5 minutes. You have a bad case of wanderlust and always feel a need to travel over the next hill, to the next town, or even to other planes of existence. You love to learn about other cultures, try new foods, and just experience a new land. Though sometimes you may travel alone and perhaps serve as a courier on horseback -- or even a griffon -- you may also serve with others as a sailor on a cargo vessel or a corsair and just go where the sea sends you. You may eventually grow beyond the world of your birth and travel the many planes in search of even greater adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one):</i><b></b> Ascetic, Drifter, Mariner.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one):</i><b></b> Challenger, Crusader, Explorer, Seeker, Wanderer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or more of the following character themes could apply to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Kinetic Master:</b> The science of movement fascinates you. You observe how a bird flaps its wings, how a fish uses its fins, and all other methods of moving. During your research, you also learn how to impede movement, slow creatures, bind the wings of flying dragons, and stop a burrowing bulette from emerging from the ground. You may craft systems to move water or defenses that can stop arrows, but you are at heart a sage of the science of movement.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Lead, follow, or just get out of my way!"</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Planewalker:</b> For some, there is no greater adventure than the infinite planes that exist beyond our perception. At first, you may just be an explorer, traveling where you have never been before. Over time you may become a guide, courier, or agent for a planar faction, since many exist throughout the planes. You may start with traveling the Astral and Ethereal, but eventually you want to visit all the Outer and Inner Planes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"There is much 'beyond your imagination' and most of it is for sale in Sigil."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Transporter:</b> Your job is to go from one place to another, transporting something as you go. You may be a courier -- carrying letters, packages or court decrees. You could drive a coach, taking people from one town to another. You could be a sailor, traveling a trade route from port to port. You have a strong sense of honor, and you abide by rules that you have set for yourself due to past experiences as well as those of any job you agree to take on. Over time, your route may get larger as you start using teleportation and extraplanar travel, but you remain bound by the rules (both your own and those of your current job).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"The rules are the rules, and I was contracted to take you here and no further."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Temporal Traveler:</b> There is one thing we all travel in, but few of us recognize it: time! You have learned that moving through time does not have to be one way and that you can learn several temporal tricks. Because of your interest in time, you also have an interest in history as well. You may be an expert in a specific area or just have general knowledge in a certain time frame.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Run out of time? Time is infinite, so we can't run out of time, but time can run out on us."</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Personal Space</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You have an extradimensional storage pocket available.<br><b>Level:</b> 1st.<br><b>Replaces:</b> The bonus feat at 1st level.<br><b>Benefit:</b> You gain an extradimensional storage space within your body. You can access it as a psi-like ability by expending your psionic focus. You may send an item to it or retrieve an item as you wish. The size of the storage space grows with your own power. At 1st level it is equivalent to a belt pouch, at 5th level it equals a sack, at 10th level it is the size of a backpack, at 15th level it is the size of a chest, and at 20th level it is the size of a Medium creature. </p>
<p align="LEFT">You cannot store anything that has extradimensional properties, such as a <i>bag of holding</i> , within your personal space. Any attempt will fail.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Temporal Grace</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can resist effects that use extradimensional, temporal, or movement spells or powers. <br><b>Level: </b> 5th.<br><b>Replaces:</b> The bonus feat at 5th level.<br><b>Benefit:</b> Your power over movement allows you to resist effects that inhibit any form of movement. Anytime you fail a save against an effect that would slow, prevent, or otherwise affect your ability to move, you may expend your psionic focus to get another saving throw, adding +1 for every 5 manifester levels you possess.</p>
