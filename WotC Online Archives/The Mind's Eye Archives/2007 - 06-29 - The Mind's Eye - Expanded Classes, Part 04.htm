<p align="LEFT">The <i><a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953747200">Players Handbook II</a></i> introduces us to expanded classes, which provide us with a way to enhance the basic classes of <b>D&amp;D </b> . In this article, we will discover some expanded class options for the psionic classes presented in <i>Complete Psionic,</i> including the<i></i>erudite.</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT" class="size3"><b>Expanded Class: The Ardent </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img border="0" src="./2007 - 06-29 - The Mind's Eye - Expanded Classes, Part 04_files/dx20070629_ardent.jpg" width="225" height="390" align="right">While some categorize psionics into disciplines, others employ a more esoteric method when using psionic abilities. They see paths of power, where they organize their powers by concept or ideal and then form them into mantles that they can then assume. As they live their lives by those ideals, so too do the ideals guide their psionic development. They seek out others who share those philosophies, often by way of a religion, but also in organizations or cults. Some even build their own groups to spread their teachings. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Ardents embrace their beliefs wholly and completely, letting them guide every aspect of their lives. Some perceive them as either very dedicated to a cause or as zealots who endlessly seek to convert others to their beliefs. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one):</i><b></b> Artisan, Ascetic, Tribal Origin.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one): </i>Crusader, Martyr, Prophet, Sage, Savage, Simple Soul, Theorist.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or more of the following character themes could apply to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Idealist: </b> You believe in an ideal, be it truth, beauty, or justice. Your belief gives you the focus to manifest your psionic powers. Of course your belief in "justice" may manifest as a law enforcement officer guarding the streets or as a vigilante dealing your own idea of justice in the alley. Your belief in "truth" may be found in painting or in an interrogator's chair. Your ideal is your guiding light in your life, and you may have more than one compatible ideal, such as truth, justice, and the dwarven way. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Professional: </b> You are defined by your profession, and your powers are just another tool for doing your job. You may be a healer, so you focus yourself on helping people with psionic powers others cannot achieve. You also may be a metalsmith, working metal with your tools and mind. You may be accused of being single-minded when it comes to your craft, but you realize that to be the best at your profession requires that kind of focus. You may have become an adventurer to find the materials you need for a chosen accomplishment, such as special ores, rare herbs, or parts of exotic beasts. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tribal Ardent: </b> Among more primitive societies psions are very rare, so those with psionic ability usually become wilders or ardents. As a tribal ardent, you focus on the basic concepts of nature, such as the elements of fire, water, air and earth. Your ideals are primitive in nature, possibly involving animal totems, spirits, and superstitions. Because of these beliefs, you lose the class skill of Psicraft but gain the skill Survival. You can still learn Psicraft, but only as a cross-class skill because it conflicts with your primitive nature.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Zealot: </b> You are a follower, be it a cause, a religion or a nation, but you are a true believer in it. You have shaped your life around your cause and seem surprised when others do not share your zeal in doing the same. You may serve a special purpose, such as a witch hunter for a church, or you might be an ambassador to foreign lands. Your cause is your life's focus and almost nothing can change your course if you believe it is part of your goal. If you ever lose your "zeal," you cannot advance in this class and might even become a "fallen ardent," losing access to your mantle's special abilities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dominant Ideal</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">An ardent develops her power by embracing philosophical concepts, with her two primary mantles serving as the core of her beliefs, and the secondary mantles providing peripheral views of the world. For some, one specific ideal outshines even its primary companion, and secondary considerations are little more than a distracting shadow of doubt. If you want to make a single mantle the focus of your ardent, selecting the dominant ideal alternative class feature allows you to use its powers more effectively. In exchange for this stronger focus, you must give up access to a new psionic mantle, reducing your overall power selection.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not assume an additional secondary psionic mantle at 10th level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> Benefit: At 10th level, you choose one of your primary mantles to become the dominant ideal in your philosophy, deepening your connection to this fundamental principle. You do not need to expend your psionic focus when applying metapsionic feats to powers you manifest from your chosen primary mantle, and the power point cost of augmenting or applying metapsionic feats to these idealized powers is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0). The reduction in cost applies only to the additional power points spent on augmentation or metapsionic feats; the power's normal power point cost is not reduced.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you later decide to make the primary mantle for which you have selected this alternative class feature into a secondary mantle, you must also swap this feature, allocating it to one of your primary mantles.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Elemental Mantles </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">There are four recognized elements, yet only a single mantle for them. Here are mantles for each element. If you use these, you will need to remove the Elements mantle from the game. Note that some powers are modified or limited to a single elemental aspect or energy.</p>

<p> * Found in <i>Complete Psionic.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Substitute Powers </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Considering the esoteric nature of mantles, different ardents may have the same mantle but have different powers available to them. A mantle can have no more than ten powers in it, and if it has fewer, add further powers to fill the gaps if that mantle has no powers of that level. The powers need to fit the theme of the mantle at the DM's discretion. Otherwise, you can substitute a power of equal or lesser level. For example, the <i>sense danger</i>* power could be added to the Fate mantle as a 3rd-level power since only seven powers and no 3rd-level powers are in it, or the <i>faint memory*</i><b></b> power could replace <i>escape detection </i>in the Deception mantle.</p>

<hr size="1">
<p align="LEFT" class="size3"><b>Expanded Class: Divine Mind </b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img border="0" src="./2007 - 06-29 - The Mind's Eye - Expanded Classes, Part 04_files/dx20070629_divmind.jpg" width="200" height="322" align="right">Not all followers of a religion are clerics and priests. Many wizards, fighters, and rogues are as devoted to their faith as clerics are, and the same is true for psionic practitioners. Some feel that they must take an active part of their faith -- as a leader, a defender, or even an avenger -- and so they follow the path of the divine mind. </p>
<p align="LEFT">While a divine mind is as dedicated to his or her faith as a paladin, one key difference is that a divine mind is much more "people friendly." They recognize that there is strength in numbers and as such they almost always serve as leaders of their groups. They have learned to use their psychic auras to benefit others around themselves and as such they share their mantle with those who follow them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one): </i>Ascetic, Drifter, Noble Scion, Soldier, Tribal Origin.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one): </i>Agent, Crusader, Leader, Martyr, Rebel, Seeker, Strategist.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or more of the following character themes could apply to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Avatar: </b> It is not enough to follow the scriptures of your church -- you are following the literal path of your deity. You dress as she does. You wield the same weapons and try to do everything she did according to the story of her path to divinity. Most deities have many legends and stories about them, and you have studied all of them and know them by heart. You try to model your life around them -- even try to reenact them if possible. You also share the same dislikes as your deity and oppose her enemies with force of arms as necessary. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Battle Strategist: </b> To you, life is a game and you are going to win. You are a master of strategy and a crafter of plans -- you're always looking for the next game to play. You have studied the tactics of the great wars, the legendary battles, and the impossible victories. You are likely to be fond of games as well, be it simple card games, chess-like games of strategy, or even athletic games. To you everything is a game of chance and strategy, and you are always looking for the winning move in all of life's challenges.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Diplomat: </b> Not everyone wants to start wars -- some are here to stop them. Preventing them by using diplomacy is preferred, but force of arms may become necessary. You are a very charismatic person, but wisdom tempers your charisma. You seek to end conflicts in a way that benefits all, listening to all complaints and trying to bring their conflict to a close. But at the same time, if they will not listen to you, then you are prepared to end the conflict by defeating them yourself. You recognize that some respond only to strength, and your strength comes from your faith and force of will. You know you will prevail.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Guardian of the Faith: </b> Your job is to defend the faith from heretics, opposing faiths, tomb raiders, and anyone who would harm it. But this duty doesn't mean that you spend time just guarding temples and the faithful -- you are a guardian of the philosophies of your deity as well. You watch over young mages if you follow a god of magic, or rescue caught thieves if you follow a god of rogues. You may watch over a holy site, be a bodyguard to a priest, or venture forth to retrieve lost relics.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ectopic Ally </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You gain the ability to manifest a single type of ectopic construct as an ally to aid you in your cause. You must choose a single type of ectopic construct that represents you and your faith, and this cannot be changed once chosen.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Replaces: </b> You do not gain psychic aura at 1st level, but you gain it at 3rd level, though with a 5-foot reduction in size. For example, this ability would be 5 feet at 3rd, 10 feet at 5th level, 15 feet at 7th, and 20 feet at 9th.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Benefit: </b> You can manifest the <i>astral construct</i> power as a psi-like ability once per day for every two levels. You may sacrifice an additional daily use to augment the power one level per use/day that is sacrificed. The power manifests at your class level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stygian Path </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Many faiths deal with undead either by creating them or destroying them. Those who follow the stygian path gain the weapons needed to face the undead.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Replaces: </b> You lose the 4th-level divine grace ability.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Benefit: </b> You gain the ability to turn undead, and you must expend your psionic focus to activate this ability. You can use this ability 3 + your Charisma modifier times per day; you turn undead as a cleric three levels lower.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hidden Talent </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If your campaign has an established history of psionics, you can replace the Wild Talent bonus feat with the Hidden Talent feat (see page 67 of the <i>Expanded Psionic Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Replaces: </b> You lose the free Wild Talent feat at 1st level.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><img border="0" src="./2007 - 06-29 - The Mind's Eye - Expanded Classes, Part 04_files/dx20070629_lurk.jpg" width="240" height="314" align="right">According to legend, the first lurk learned her skills while hiding in the shadow of the first psychic warrior. There may be some truth to that legend since the two classes do share several similarities, but it is more likely that some psychic warriors chose to use their skills in stealthier ways and sought to unlock psionic methods to enhance their ambush skills. Some lurks are just thieves with psionic powers while others are hunters, spies, and even covert fighters.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one):</i><b></b> Artisan, Drifter, Gladiator, Guttersnipe, Soldier.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one):</i><b></b> Agent, Challenger, Companion, Daredevil, Mercenary, Rebel, Seeker, Strategist, Trickster, Wanderer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or more of the following character themes could apply to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hunter: </b> You are hunting something or someone and will not let anything get in your way. You may be a bounty hunter, a tomb raider, or just someone who retrieves "lost" goods. As a hunter, you are defined by what you hunt. Maybe you hunt monsters as a freelance exterminator, or perhaps you lead expeditions of nobles after some creature in the jungle. Maybe you hunt objects simply to find them and add them to your own collection, or perhaps you act as a retrieval agent who searches for something specific that was lost. And of course you could be a bounty hunter who seeks out some of the most dangerous prey of all: intelligent beings.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Psychic Rogue: </b> You are a thief in psionic clothes. Be it a pickpocket, con artist, or burglar, you use your psionic abilities to be a better thief and to give you an edge over other rogues. You may work alone or maybe even be part of a guild of psychic thieves, wilders, and psions. In some settings, psionics is forbidden or psychics are in hiding. In such a setting, you have the advantage since you are an expert at hiding, though you may also probably be on someone's wanted list.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sneak Fighter: </b> You are a dirty fighter and you admit it. The only rule of combat you recognize is to get it over with as quickly as possible and by any means necessary. Combat is not about rules, strategy, or honor. It is about survival. It does not matter what is required of you as long as you survive to fight again. Your life has been one struggle after another -- perhaps you grew up on the streets or got lost in the wilderness -- but you have endured it. You are the kind of person that always has a way out, you maintain several secret supply caches in case of emergency, and you always sit with your back against the wall. You choose your friends carefully and are unforgiving to those who betray you. You do not take at all well to anything that interferes with your survival.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vigilante: </b> You are the justice in the night; you may be working alone, as part of a guild, or maybe even as an agent for a government or organization. Not all law enforcement takes place in the day. Some infiltrate criminal organizations and take them down from within. Sometimes when a person is a victim of a crime, she may decide to take justice into her own hands and deal with the criminals directly. You might also be an agent of a government, such as a spy sent into enemy territory to gain information or possibly to strike a blow for your liege and country. </p>

You are not limited in the number of powers you can learn; in fact you seem to pick them up from other manifesters quite frequently. Perhaps it is a bloodline ability shared by all in your family, maybe you have an unusual ancestor, such as a sapphire dragon or other psionic creature, or perhaps it is just a cosmic twist of fate that gave you this skill, but it means you are different even among those already considered different. Unlike most psionic users, you can learn almost any power you come across; some are more difficult than others, but that just makes things more interesting.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Backgrounds (choose one):</i><b></b> Artisan, Ascetic, Noble Scion.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Suggested Personality Archetypes (choose one):</i><b></b> Challenger, Explorer, Prophet, Royalty, Sage, Seeker, Simple Soul, Strategist, Theorist, Wanderer.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Character Themes </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or more of the following character themes could apply to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Savant: </b> You are a gifted psionic user, which was recognized early on, but only now do they realize you are an erudite. You excel in learning new powers and have twice the repertoire of other psions you know. But at the same time, you have a lot of pressure on you to achieve greatness. Others seem to expect you to create all-new powers, craft never-before-seen psionic items, and to become a living legend. Maybe you became an adventurer to achieve this destiny, or maybe you are trying to run away from it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Archivist: </b> You are seeking to learn all that is learnable. While others trailblaze new psionic powers, you seek out old ones lost in the past. Ancient tales and historical stories fascinate you, and you always have your nose in an old book. You have a list of places you want to visit, people you want to meet, and things you want to do before you die. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Psionicist: </b> You consider yourself a generalist in psionics. To you, all psionic powers are learnable, and you plan to learn them all. You don't understand how someone could focus on just one discipline, on just one mantle, or on a select number of powers. You are the one to ask when anyone has a question about psionics, and you intend to one day be a metapsionic master.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blaster: </b> You focus on offensive powers and are a master of the military use of psionics. To you, your powers are weapons and it is your job to wield them against the enemy. You have an array of powers to call upon. Rays are your favorite types of attacks, and you have created several new powers based off the many ray spells you have seen used in battle. You think in tactical terms and choose your actions carefully. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Favored Discipline </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Unlike most erudites, you have a discipline that you favor above all others. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Replaces: </b> You lose your 1st-level bonus feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Benefit: </b> You choose a single discipline and all powers of that discipline, no matter what class list they are on, are considered general psion/wilder powers for purposes of learning.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mantled Erudite </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You have learned to use a single psionic mantle.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Replaces: </b> You lose your 1st-level bonus feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Benefit: </b> You gain access to a single psionic mantle. You gain the granted ability of the mantle, and the powers of that mantle are considered general psion/wilder powers for the purpose of learning.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Convert Spell to Power </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Your training has included basic magical theory as well as the usual psionic training.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Replaces: </b> You lose your 1st-level bonus feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Benefit: </b> You add Spellcraft to your class skill list, which allows you to attempt to convert an arcane spell into a power you can add to your repertoire. You treat the spell as a discipline power for the basis of learning it, and you must first succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level) and then a Psicraft check as per the normal rules of learning a discipline power (see page 154 of <i>Complete Psionic</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each spell costs a certain number of power points to manifest. The higher the level of the spell, the more power points it costs. The table below describes each spell's cost.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Note: If this system intrigues you, you can see a spell point variant system starting on page 153 of <i>Unearthed Arcana.</i></p>

<p align="LEFT">* 0-level spells cost no power points to manifest. Instead you may manifest a number of 0-level spells each day equal to three + the number of power points gained by that class at 1st level. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The erudite uses her manifester level for determining the effects of the spell being manifested, with one significant exception. Spells that deal a number of dice of damage based on caster level (such as <i>magic missile,</i><i>searing light, </i>or <i>lightning bolt</i>) deal damage as if cast by a character of the minimum level of the class capable of casting the spell. Spells whose damage is partially based on caster level, but that don't deal a number of dice of damage based on caster level (such as <i>produce flame</i> or an<i> inflict</i> spell) use the erudite's normal manifester level to determine damage. Use the erudite's normal manifester level for all other effects, including range and duration.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, a <i>fireball</i> deals a number of dice of damage based on the erudite's manifester level, so when manifested it deals 5d6 points of damage (as if cast by a 5th-level wizard, which is the minimum level of wizard capable of casting <i>fireball</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">An erudite can pay additional power points to augment the dice of damage dealt by a spell. Every 1 extra power point spent at the time of manifesting increases the spell's effective caster level by 1 for purposes of dealing damage. The damage-dealing spell's caster level cannot be increased above the erudite's manifester level, or above the normal maximum allowed by the spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, even at 7th level, our erudite's <i>lightning bolts</i> deal only 5d6 points of damage (just like a 5th-level wizard) unless she spends extra power points. If she spends 1 extra power point (making the <i>lightning bolt</i> cost 6 points rather than 5), the spell deals 6d6 points of damage. A second extra power point would increase the damage to 7d6 points, but she can't spend more points than this, since her manifester level is only 7th. Were she 10th level or higher, she could spend a maximum of 5 extra power points on this spell, raising the damage up to 10d6, the maximum allowed for a <i>lightning bolt</i> spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Similarly, her <i>magic missile</i> spell shoots only one missile unless she spends extra power points. An extra 2 power points increases the caster level from 1st to 3rd, granting her one additional missile. She can spend a maximum of 6 additional power points in this manner, increasing her effective caster level to 7th for damage purposes and granting her a total of four missiles. If she were 9th level or higher, she could spend a maximum of 8 extra power points, granting her five missiles (just like a 9th-level caster).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Spells that allow a character to recall or recast a spell cannot be learned. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Because the spells are now effectively psionic powers, they are no longer affected by metamagic feats. However, metapsionic feats can affect them as they would a psionic power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As with casting a spell, manifesting a spell may require certain components (see page 174 of the <i>Player's Handbook)</i>. Some of the components remain unchanged, such as verbal, somatic, and XP cost. Spells with expensive material components (non-negligible) require you to spend an additional 2 power points when manifesting the spell in lieu of the material components. If you happen to have the material components, no additional power point cost is assessed. Spells with a focus are treated the same as those with a material component. If the spell has an expensive material component and a focus, the additional power point cost would be 4.</p>

<p>This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a <i>detect magic </i>spell, but <i>arcane sight </i>does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.</p>
<p>You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the <i>detect magic </i>spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + one-half caster level for a nonspell effect.)</p>
<p>If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.</p>
