 adventure hooks in which heroes race a countdown to disaster. How will 
the PCs react when the difference between living and dying is a matter 
of a few crucial days, hours, or seconds? Steal these hooks and work 
them into your <b>Eberron</b> campaign to find out!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Touch of the Keeper</b></p>
<p align="left">The innkeeper wakes up the PCs in the middle of the night. He says that a shipment of <i>potions of</i><i>remove disease </i>was
 lost somewhere along the road between here and the shipment's 
destination: a disease-stricken village. He asks the heroes to help find
 the courier, and recover the shipment and deliver it to the village. 
Time is short; people are dying from the disease there every day, plus 
the innkeeper's sister and brother-in-law live there. Because of that, 
he worries that they might fall prey to the disease as well. Though the 
road to the village winds through hilly bandit territory, he and others 
don't think that bandits took the shipment. The courier actually is the 
culprit since he diverted the potions to a higher bidder: a kobold mine 
that is infested with green slime. Can the PCs negotiate with the 
kobolds to recover enough of the shipment to save the village? What 
happens when it turns out that the unscrupulous courier travels from 
town to town <i>spreading</i> magical diseases (and selling his fake <i>remove disease</i> potions) in the name of the dark deity known as the Keeper?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Moon's Curse</b></p>
<p align="left">That tusk made a nasty gouge -- but with the wereboar 
slain, the only matter the heroes must attend to now is curing the 
lycanthropy that lurks in the wounded PC's veins. Stranded in the midst 
of the Shadow Marches, locating belladonna (wolfsbane) will be 
difficult; and for it to be effective, the afflicted hero must consume 
it within an hour of the attack. If belladonna can't be found, then the 
countdown to the next full moon begins, which is when everyone can 
expect the afflicted PC to run amok in his new boar guise -- unless the 
heroes can find a cleric of 12th level or higher in the next three days.
 If that doesn't work, they can see about casting <i>remove curse</i> on the victim <i>during</i>
 the three-day full moon period. . . . But by that point, a traveling 
missionary of the Church of the Silver Flame has discovered the PC's 
condition. He offers to help, but he secretly contacts some allies to 
come capture the PC before he or she can become a threat to "the 
populace and to him/herself." In any case, only days remain before the 
issue is forced one way or another.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Secret of the Stolen Psyche</b></p>
<p align="left">During a visit to a small town on the western end of the
 Towering Wood, Patriarch Dalin d'Vadalis falls victim to a rakshasa's 
dark spell. His body crumples and his soul is stolen away -- to be used 
for evil in the Demon Wastes. House Vadalis summons the adventurers to 
accompany Brumar d'Vadalis, Dalin's brother, on a quest into the heart 
of the Demon Wastes to recover the patriarch's spirit. The clock is 
ticking: The soul must be restored to the patriarch's body in a matter 
of eight days, or he will die. Even worse, the rakshasa who cast the 
spell believes that the Vadalis family holds the key to freeing the 
imprisoned rajah overlords. If he can perform a divination ritual on the
 captured soul, he could trace the Vadalis bloodline to a secret branch 
of the family that associates with a noble blue dragon named Tarys. If 
the rakshasa learns of Tarys and the power she wields over certain 
Khyber seals, it could spell the beginning of a new Age of Demons.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Countdown to the Year of Undeath</b></p>
<p align="left">Dolurrh is coterminous with the Material Plane only once
 every hundred years: the last time, when the Last War was in its 
infancy, the Realm of the Dead poured thousands of lost souls into 
Eberron. Now only days remain before it happens again -- and Thrane is 
about to make a crucial mistake. In the Mournlands near Thrane's border,
 a new manifest zone of Dolurrh has appeared. The government of Thrane 
is arming paladins and commoners alike with flametouched iron swords, 
planning to attack the manifest zone and all undead within it once it 
"opens" -- however, the PCs have reason to believe that the restless 
dead who will be summoned there are actually the souls of innocent 
soldiers from throughout the history of the Last War, including citizens
 of Thrane and those who died on the Day of Mourning. The dead will be 
confused, mute and apathetic from the effects of Dolurrh, may attack 
back at Thrane's troops out of bewilderment -- yet they have no desire 
to harm anyone. Can the PCs gather evidence to stop Thrane's tragic 
mistake? One of lost souls, a young general who died fighting for Cyre, 
knows the secret behind the Day of Mourning. Can the PCs learn enough 
from him to help rescue some of the dead from Dolurrh, or even somehow 
redeem the Mournlands, before the Realm of the Dead ends its coterminous
 year?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Perils of Giant Wizardry</b></p>
<p align="left">In an ancient Xen'drik dungeon built by an industrious, 
now-extinct species of hill giant, the PCs encounter deadly traps as 
well as aging mechanical wonders that, in their neglected state, are 
just as dangerous as the traps. This combined with the fact that the PCs
 must drag a large stone statue into the dungeon's depths to unlock a 
lost treasure makes for many life-or-death moments. A massive portcullis
 that once acted as an automated entry gate now slams shut at 
unpredictable times. The timing gear on a moving walkway is loose, 
causing the walkway to accelerate wildly or stop suddenly. An odd giant 
totem pole with rotating heads is a combination lock to open a secret 
chamber, but four of the five correct combinations will seal the chamber
 after a matter of seconds, and three of those will begin flooding the 
chamber with brackish water soon after. The central device of the entire
 dungeon is a mystic artifact that radiates power to the entire 
subterranean structure -- in fact, its energy has counterbalanced the 
withering hand of time for centuries. If the heroes can drag the stone 
statue through a shield of whirring blades guarding the artifact, they 
have a chance to remove the artifact -- but without the artifact's 
power, the ancient structure begins to collapse. The heroes may have 
only a dozen rounds to escape before the dungeon crushes them.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Mini-Hooks</b></p>
<ul>
<li>As they regain consciousness after an ambush, the heroes are tied to
 a driverless House Orien coach that is hurtling toward the edge of a 
cliff.</li>
<li>The heroes must rescue the noble's niece from a menacing spellgaunt (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882680000">Monster Manual II</a></i>,
 or substitute another arachnid creature) before it begins the process 
of draining her magical abilities -- but they must cross a treacherous 
underground lake guarded by a chuul (<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndcore/177550000">Monster Manual</a></i>, or substitute another aquatic subterranean creature) to get to her.</li>
<li>The heroes must capture the shaman of a Poison Dusk lizardfolk tribe
 to discern the nature of the deadly poison she uses, before a valued 
NPC dies from an envenomed arrow wound.</li>
<li>A child is lost somewhere in Breland's King's Forest -- time is running out before he will die of exposure.</li>
<li>A trapped room's ceiling begins to lower on the heroes, and they must answer three riddling <i>magic mouths</i> to escape.</li>
<li>An enchanted mask is found on a deserted galleon from Sarlona, and a
 series of bodies begin to show up, tracking the mask's path to the PCs.</li>
<li>During an unearthly storm, the heroes must rescue a family of 
dwarven travelers before a tornado sweeps them from their hiding place.</li>
<li>The rope suspending a lift platform is fraying during a fight.</li>
<li>A wedding in which a devious changeling has replaced the bride must be stopped.</li>
