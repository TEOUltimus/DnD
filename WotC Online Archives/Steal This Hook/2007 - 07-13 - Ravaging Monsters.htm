It you don't have this book, then you can replace the burrow roots with bulettes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">With an opening like this one, the PCs provide the 
motivation. However, as they investigate they find a number of people 
who want this problem solved and are genuine in their desires.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-40 The burrow roots are a new colony in the area that
 an evil druid planted to drive the farmers away and return the land to a
 wilder state.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-75 The burrow roots were planted here by minions of 
Iuz, as a means of destabilizing the populace through fear. Hundreds of 
them are maturing in different "nests" within the region, and they will 
cause a mass panic if no one does anything. Finding the people (or 
whatever) behind them could be more difficult.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-85 The burrow roots have broken free of whoever was controlling them and are now on a rampage of their own.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 The roots have been around for months now, and 
several villages in the region are preparing to "root" them out and 
destroy them. However, the burrow roots are elusive and retreat before 
being destroyed. The frustration is increasing as farmers lose crops and
 livestock and cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Burrow roots could probably go anywhere. Using them this
 way is just one idea. They make good creatures that are controlled by 
some more powerful enemy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron: </b> Anywhere in central Breland is a good 
place for this adventure. Placing it near a border allows you to tie 
them to some unresolved conflict from the Last War.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms: </b> Set this adventure in the 
Dalelands, somewhere where Zhentarim can be blamed for their presence. 
On the other hand, the Zhentarim don't have to be behind the 
infestation; drow are possible, and the Dales have a lot of enemies. 
They could even be tied to Sembian nobles or merchants.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b> This adventure goes in a rural area 
where some power, group, or person has a vested interest in terrorizing 
the populace. A small town nearby would help, or several villages. The 
mastermind should, ideally, be someone local.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2007-13%20-%20Ravaging%20Monsters_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>

 is a beautiful country, with mountains and forests and rivers 
throughout. The greatest concentration of people is in the west near the
 sea, but Saradush and (newly) Riatavin are sizable communities in the 
east. The PCs are traveling north along the small road (seeing more and 
more use in recent years) from Saradush to Riatavin. Perhaps they 
recently sorted out the mess of "<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sh/20061121a">The Three Hagstekeers</a>".
 Perhaps not. Whatever the reason, they find themselves on this small 
road. They have not seen anyone for a couple hours when they see, off to
 the east, a small flying dragon about half a mile away. It appears to 
those with good Spot check results to be carrying a sheep in one claw, 
and something small in the other. Really good Listen check results at 
this range allow them to hear cries for help. The creature, a wyvern, 
flies close toward them so that they can determine that the creature is 
carrying a human as well as the sheep, before veering off toward the 
nearby Omlarandin Mountains.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This may not be enough to get them interested, but 
Riatavin is still more than a day's travel away. This region is 
plentiful with farms and ranches, any of which could provide a place to 
stay. From the people there, the PCs learn that wyverns are flying out 
of the Omlarandins and snatching up farmers and shepherds in the plains 
north of the Omlarandins and south of Riatavin. Normally the creatures 
come out only to grab sheep for their meals, and the people around the 
Omlarandins have become accustomed to a small loss of livestock. The 
taking of shepherds and farmers is new, and everyone knows that the 
wyverns don't hunt such small creatures as humans for food. Since the 
frequency of attacks is rising, the people are worried, and any offers 
of help would be gratefully received.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If they don't stop with anyone for the night, then the 
following day the road passes close to a large field of sheep. The sheep
 are about 600 feet away from the road, attended by three shepherds (a 
brother and two sisters). As the PCs pass, two wyverns streak down from 
the sky and make attacks at sheep and shepherd alike. Once one grabs one
 of the shepherds, it flies off without even taking a sheep. The second 
takes a sheep, and grabs one of the women that was defending the sheep, 
and then flies off. The surviving family member begs the PCs to help 
rescue his or her siblings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Note: This adventure works equally well with blackwings (a new creature in <i>Monster Manual V</i>). Change the mind flayers to mind flayer necromancers, and you're good to go.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">While the motivations on the villain end may be varied, 
all the people here are simple folk who really need help from flying 
monsters. No one is capable of harnessing wyverns and throwing them at 
his or her friends.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-40 A pack of wyverns that lives in the Omlarandins 
has been dominated by a group of mind flayers that reached the surface 
from the Underdark in the mountain range. They are using the wyverns to 
collect slaves and food, since wyvern brain is not nearly as good as 
humanoid brain.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-65 One survivor of a wyvern attack is in a village 
just north of the mountains. This woman, Zeradu Eldmina, remembers very 
little of her experience other than being snatched by a wyvern and 
dropped in the mountains. She barely survived by crawling into a place 
of hiding and then making her way out of the mountains days later. What 
really happened was that mind flayers dominated her and modified her 
memory, and she is now a plant among the humans and delivers information
 to the mind flayers without remembering doing so.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-90 The wyverns are working on their own. There is a 
half-fiend wyvern leading and organizing the creatures for some fiendish
 purpose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The creatures making the attacks on humans are not
 wyverns at all, but some kind of shapechanged creatures. The PCs can 
slay wyverns to their hearts' content without solving the problem. They 
have to dig deeper.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can probably work some wyverns into your campaign and, with them, this adventure idea. <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/177410000">Lords of Madness</a></i> would help with the mind flayers, assuming you go that route, and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953757200">Fiendish Codex I</a></i>and<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953877200">Fiendish Codex II</a></i> would help if you decide on shapechanged fiends instead. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron: </b> Though Droaam no doubt has wyverns and 
mind flayers, it's kind of short on humanoids working farms. Try 
Karrnath instead, where this could be a welcome change from undead.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b> Takes some farms, add some wyverns and 
some mind flayers perhaps (for spice), stir well and heat until boiling,
 then simmer a few hours.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk: </b> The Theocracy of the Pale works, or 
perhaps the Duchy of Tenh with the wyverns coming from a forest nearby. 
Ahlissa, especially in the south, is also a good location.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2007-13%20-%20Ravaging%20Monsters_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="590"></p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>That's a Big Bug -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2007-13%20-%20Ravaging%20Monsters_files/dx20070713_stealhook_siegebeetle.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="202" width="240">During
 the Last War, the nations of Khorvaire were using just about every kind
 of creature or ally they could (which is great for DMs since it allows 
you to tailor your campaign with new creatures as needed or desired). 
This was especially true of the last years of the war, when resources 
were running very low. And Cyre was the most desperate of nations. 
Situated in the middle, it was attacked on all sides throughout the Last
 War. The leaders of Cyre used both House Cannith devices and creatures 
from other planes. When the Day of Mourning came, these creatures were 
left behind to survive as best as they could.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Valenar is a land of warlike elves that continues to 
make raids on its neighbors (not the Mournland, but Karrnath and the 
Talenta Plains). But some elves engage in more peaceful lifestyles, and 
many small communities exist in the northern part of the country near 
the Blade Desert and the Mournland. The PCs are visiting one of the 
major cities of Valenar when they hear rumors of destruction in the 
north. The rumors are crazy and varied, running from "it's nothing" to 
"a whole village was destroyed by demon beetles!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">House Lyrandar has land in the northern part of the 
country, and a lesser member of this house named Zeradu sends a note to 
the PCs asking them to meet him at his favorite tavern. He explains that
 the rumors are probably nothing, but they talk of events that have 
happened very close to House Lyrandar land and the senior members of the
 house are concerned. He offers the PCs either gold or an exchange of 
services (depending on what will motivate them) to go north, see what is
 going on, and make sure that whatever it is doesn't affect House 
Lyrandar.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-45 Zeradu hopes that his swift action in this 
"crisis" will bring him to the notice of senior house members and lead 
to a promotion. He hopes there is something horribly wrong, and that the
 PCs can take care of it so that he can claim credit for as much as 
possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-75 Zeradu hates this assignment and wants out of this
 elf-infested country. He hopes that by solving this problem he can come
 to the notice of house officials elsewhere and get a transfer. His 
hatred of his current situation is poorly hidden in his attitude, and he
 would not mind at all if some elves died so that he could be 
transferred.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Zeradu is being manipulated into what someone 
thinks is a fool's errand. The manipulator knows of Zeradu's ambition 
(see first option) but thinks that there is nothing to the rumors. By 
taking a lot of effort over nothing, Zeradu can be made to look like a 
fool and a waster of house resources, and the manipulator can remove him
 from the house. Perhaps the two are vying for the same woman?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-75 There are destroyed villages and even a small town. Siege beetles (see <i>Monster Manual V</i>)
 from the plane of Shavarath were called into Cyre during the Last War, 
and they remain still. They have wandered over the border and through 
the Blade Desert looking for food, since they have cleaned out the 
corpses in the southern part of the Mournland. They are mindless but 
hungry vermin who avoid armed traveling groups but attack settlements.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-90 Siege beetles are involved, but only two. 
Karrnathi war groups that are tired of the Valaes Tairn raids use them. 
They seek to lure a raiding group into a trap and are using the beetles 
to create havoc in the hope of tricking the elves into preparing for the
 wrong foes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 A demon prince of Shavarath sent the siege beetles
 to exact revenge on the elves because a group of Valaes Tairn invaded 
the demon prince's fortress and disrupted a major offensive against a 
devil lord's forces. The siege beetles might be half-fiends as well, and
 other demons may be waiting to tear apart vulnerable elven flesh. The 
PCs would simply be in the way of the demon prince's goal of 
obliterating Valenar a little at a time.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Because siege beetles appear near fields of carnage, or 
are used there by spellcasters, this adventure idea doesn't fit just 
anywhere. But, once you find a good spot for the beetles, all you need 
is your core books and <i>Monster Manual V</i> to run it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms: </b> The area around the High Moor 
is very good for this adventure, since the High Moor is the blasted 
graveyard of the destroyed Miyeritar elven kingdom. Siege beetles could 
have come from Acheron to clean an area of the Moor so that someone else
 could establish a fortification.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b> The siege beetles should come from a battlefield area, preferably in the wilderness, because they eat corpses.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk: </b> Ancient battlefields are not 
plentiful, but you could set this adventure in the Shield Lands where 
they meet with the Lands of Iuz. A lot of battles take place there, and 
it would be natural for siege beetles to be called to the area.</p>
