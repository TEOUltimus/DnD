<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="LEFT">Heroes survive and even prosper amid the grim dangers found in the <b>Eberron</b>
 setting, but the bony hand of death is always behind them. In these 
adventure hooks, the player characters come closer than ever before to 
the Keeper's cold touch -- perhaps they may even shudder under a sense 
of their own mortality. Enjoy.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>A Glimpse of the Mourned</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A young lass in the city of Vulyar, Karrnath, contacts 
the heroes. She asks for help locating her father Eemarch, who left for 
the Mournland in a huff a week ago, with the stated intention of 
"speaking with Drogan." Drogan was her brother who died on the Day of 
Mourning, so she worries that her father is mad, or worse -- that some 
creature is posing as the spirit of her brother Drogan. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs follow Eemarch's trail into the dead-gray mist 
and discover the ruins of a small military barracks that recently and 
hastily was boarded up from the inside. Within they find Eemarch 
emaciated and cowering in the corner. Pages from a Sovereign Host 
religious text plaster the interior walls of the barracks, perhaps as a 
protective gesture. Discarded nearby is a pair of dark-lensed goggles. 
What's happening here?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eemarch brought a pair of magic death-goggles to the 
Mournland because he thought they would let him see and speak to the 
ghost of his fallen son Drogan, but they worked a little too well. 
Eemarch saw so many tormented Mournland souls surrounding him when he 
strapped on the goggles that he went off the deep end and couldn't 
return home. Has Eemarch accidentally helped uncover part of the mystery
 of the Mournland -- and should the heroes follow up on the mystery? 
What other secrets of death can the PCs uncover with the goggles -- and 
who or what will rise up to stop them? Can Eemarch find Drogan, or has 
one of the Lords of Dust tricked him?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Coffin Vault</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In Xen'drik, the heroes discover the entrance to a 
dungeon, or so they may think. The entrance actually serves as a coffin 
for a famous giant that has been dead since the end of the Dragon-Fiend 
Wars. Perhaps tomb-looters recently pried open the entrance, or perhaps 
the PCs find it occupied by a cult of savage giants dedicated to the 
worship of their mighty forerunner. Elaborate traps wait for hapless 
beings in some areas of the dungeon, and cave-dwelling predators guard 
the vault as their adopted territory. What's more, the ancient giant was
 steps from attaining lichhood, and now his soul twists in agony in a 
half-completed necromantic ritual that has been unfinished for 
millennia. Perhaps the PCs help the giant by severing the strands 
connecting him to his bygone life, or perhaps the spilling of their 
blood by the resident giant cultists triggers the completion of the 
ritual.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Endeavors of the Dead Ancestor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In Valenar, two high-ranking <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ebds/20041011a">Keepers of the Past</a>,
 a cleric named Quavion, and a bard called Jalanthe, share the same 
patron ancestor, Luchan. Each strive to outdo the other in becoming the 
ultimate avatar of their ancestor. In fact, Quavion and Jalanthe have 
dedicated their lives to researching Luchan's deeds and accomplishments.
 Jalanthe has a breakthrough when she discovers evidence that Luchan had
 a secret laboratory in the jungles of Aerenal, and she contacts the 
adventurers to accompany her on an expedition there. Quavion, meanwhile,
 hires his own expedition to beat her there, and the race is on. When 
the heroes' party arrives, they find some kind of dormant magical 
mechanism in Luchan's lab. Was Luchan close to activating an eldritch 
machine? Or was it finished but spent: a weapon used to fend off 
draconic attacks thousands of years ago? What will the PCs do when 
Quavion and Jalanthe, blinded by their need for attention from a dead 
ancestor, compete to reactivate the device?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Halfling's Bargain</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Babbin Olek is being watched. The old halfling thinks 
he's being stalked -- he sees a dark figure behind him as he goes about 
plying his jewelry trade in the city. Who is it? A pickpocket? A madman 
with an obsession for Olek's family? A gangster who feels he has 
business "protecting" the halfling's jewel stock?</p>
<p align="LEFT">The adventurers, hired by Olek to investigate the 
stalker, may discover that the truth is even grimmer. What Olek really 
thinks is that the dark figure haunting him may be someone who has 
learned of his bargain with a dark power -- a bargain that supposedly 
extended Olek's life. In fact, he thinks it might even be the Keeper 
personified. Babbin Olek is almost three hundred, which is over a 
century older than his race should live. However, his appearance is that
 of a mere 120-year-old. Olek's end of the bargain is that he sets a 
high-quality dragonshard under his pillow every year on his birthday, 
and it disappears when he rises in the morning. Olek's dragonshard 
supply is replenished by Olek's contacts in the gem trade, but the 
shards have apparently stopped doing the trick, because the halfling is 
beginning to show his age.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Who is stalking Olek? If it is someone who seeks his 
death, can the PCs help Olek at all? If not, who tricked an old man into
 believing this charade about Death ninety-nine years ago -- and is the 
same party responsible today? If the Keeper isn't behind it, how do the 
PCs account for Olek's unnatural lifespan? And where have all those 
dragonshards gone?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Dolurrh Slippage</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Although Dolurrh is coterminous, a cleric of the Silver Flame attempts to use <i>raise dead</i>
 on an important fallen comrade. The divine energies of the spell 
attract a host of spirits from the coterminous plane of the dead, and 
the cleric accidentally instills the body with the wrong soul. Now the 
body of a hierarch of the Church of Silver Flame is possessed with the 
soul of -- someone. Could it be that of a shifter girl who died in her 
youth? Of a bored and bitter Sharn housewife and cart-accident victim? 
What if it's the soul of a vengeful Cultist of the Dragon Below slain by
 fire during a Silver Flame crusade? Or the soul of a warforged soldier 
who met the wrong end of an enemy wizard's <i>lightning bolt</i>? Or the
 soul of an infant who died at the age of two weeks? Or the soul of a 
worldly former Kech Shaarat general from Darguun? Or perhaps the 
sixty-thousand-year-old soul of an elf sorcerer who has intentionally 
maneuvered his way from Dolurrh into this important modern body. What 
will happen? How will the PCs get involved? What becomes of the 
hierarch's real soul? It's your campaign -- this is just the hook. . . .</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Mini-Hooks</b></p>

<li>One of the heroes is contacted by someone claiming to be a planar traveler stuck in Dolurrh.<br><br></li>
<li>Undead mind flayers twist the psychic energies surrounding a small village cemetery.<br><br></li>
<li>An aging painter preoccupied with her mortality turns to a necromancer to provide a new type of canvas for her paints.<br><br></li>
<li>During a school play about an old fable of the Keeper, a schoolboy 
goes missing -- and investigators find a bloody scythe nearby.<br><br></li>
<li>A rash of suicides prompts a Sharn journalist to investigate -- and then the journalist kills himself, too.<br><br></li>
<li>A powerful mage born two thousand years ago has been cheating death by combining the <i>clone</i>

 millennial master plan or a wise sage spanning Eberron's history.</li>
