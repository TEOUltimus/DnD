<p align="LEFT">Last month we saw the release of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/956120000">Three-Dragon Ante</a>,</i> which is both a real card game and the game-within-a-game of choice in taverns and gambling parlors across the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 world. In honor of its release, today's Steal This Hook! takes 
Three-Dragon Ante as its theme and helps you weave the game into your <b>Eberron</b> campaign. Enjoy.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Highest Stakes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2012-12%20-%20Three-Dragon%20Ante_files/eb20051212_stealhook_cards.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="212" width="152">It's
 not surprising that the party's rogue would owe debts to Vrogath the 
Lucky, infamous crimelord of the Sharn undercity. The grizzled, 
bespectacled orc helps many adventuring rogues get their start. But when
 it comes to debt, Vrogath doesn't forgive or forget. And now that the 
PC rogue has done well for herself, it's time for Vrogath to collect -- 
with interest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It starts with some socioeconomic pressure -- local 
merchants won't take the PC's money or render service to her or her 
compatriots. It develops into more direct, physical pressure -- a rough 
encounter with Vrogath's thugs under a dripping Sharn skybridge. It ends
 with a meeting with Vrogath himself, and an offer. If the PC agrees to a
 game of "platinum ante" (Three-Dragon Ante played for platinum pieces) 
in the amount of the rogue's debt, she can walk away debt-free and rich 
besides. But Vrogath is notoriously "lucky" -- in that he cheats 
mercilessly -- and the game would be played on his turf. Can the PCs 
beat Vrogath at his own game? If "victory" would mean an enraged Sharn 
crimelord, is there any winning hand?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Brass Assassin</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">It's not just rogues and criminals who enjoy a game of 
cards -- many a gambit is played in the marble halls of courtesans. But 
when a murder occurs over a game of platinum ante, no expense is spared 
to find the perpetrator.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The killer used contact poison on a Three-Dragon Ante 
deck -- in particular, it is believed, on a Brass Dragon card -- to 
murder a beloved advisor of Lord Barwith ir'Stramm, a noble in western 
Breland. Lord Barwith himself was in that game and feels he was the 
intended target of the poison; he hires the adventurers to serve as his 
personal investigators of the crime.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In a dramatic scene, the players pose as members of Lord
 Barwith's court to trick the killer into striking again. You, as the 
DM, may secretly choose one of the cards to be poisoned -- the 
9-strength Brass Dragon, for example -- and watch to see whether a 
player draws it over several gambits. You could also have players roll a
 Fortitude save -- whether they're poisoned or not -- whenever any of 
the players draws a Brass Dragon card. Has the killer dared to strike 
again using the same methods? Might he or she have switched what card is
 poisoned, or poisoned multiple cards? Can the heroes trace the source 
of the card tampering? What if Lord Barwith wasn't the target, and his 
advisor was key to some enemy plot?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Riches at the Roadhouse</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2012-12%20-%20Three-Dragon%20Ante_files/eb20051212_stealhook_3DA.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="217" width="306">Goradra Roadhouse, an adventurers' saloon whose foundation nearly teeters on the Goradra Gap in the Mror Holds (<i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting, </i>page
 193), is a breeding ground for the gambling debts of fortune-hunters. 
The Gap, the deepest and possibly the most chillingly mysterious chasm 
in all of Khorvaire, draws fortune-seekers from around the plane. Some 
never return from their optimistic spelunk, but a lucky few come back 
drunk on adventure and laden with treasure, looking for ale, a place to 
rest, and a game of platinum ante or ten.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The party members have many opportunities to use 
Three-Dragon Ante to gain information or seek adventure here. Do they 
butter up the drunken barbarian during a game to discover his route to a
 potential dragonshard hoard? Do they throw a game to a reticent ranger 
to gauge his effectiveness as a Gap guide? Do they stage a high-stakes 
game with a limb on the line to flush out a thieving Jhorash'tar orc 
miner? Do they simply challenge the best, richest player in the saloon 
to an all-or-nothing gambit to fund their expedition down into the 
chasm?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>A Dragon's Gambit </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The secret society of Argonnessen dragons known as the 
Chamber has disguised agents throughout Khorvaire. One such agent is 
Err'a'galash, a young bronze dragon posing as the noble Lady Helon of 
Aundair, who fraternizes freely both with Aundair royalty and with the 
half-elves of Stormhome. Her mission among humanoid society is to 
monitor political developments in Aundair and report to her associates 
in the Chamber any happenings of import to the draconic Prophecy. When 
Three-Dragon Ante becomes popular among House Lyrandar, however, her 
draconic pride is insulted; she hates seeing her glorious brethren cast 
into playing pieces in a mortal betting game. Her egotistical wrath 
reaches its peak when some suggest that her intellect may not be up to 
the task of beating Lyrandar's elite players -- and she begins a secret 
plan to become the most accomplished player in Aundair.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Will a bronze dragon stoop to hiring secret tutors in 
the play of this mere card game? Might she run back-door tournaments, 
inviting experts from other nations to help her train for defeating 
House Lyrandar? Does she suspect that the game actually has something to
 do with the revelation of Prophecy among Aundair humanoids? Does she 
favor dragonmarked players, or use some sort of magical trickery to gain
 the upper hand? Is she a rogue among the Chamber in her interest in the
 game, or is it a greater concern among dragonkind?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Mini-Hooks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Try these mini-hooks if you want a way to introduce the game into your campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>After a PC wins a particularly topsy-turvy tavern game of copper 
ante using the Druid card, an impressed shifter invites the PCs to join a
 higher-stakes game in his hometown in the Eldeen Reaches.<br><br></li>
<li>A skilled gnomish painter creates a Three-Dragon Ante deck using 
silver- and gold-laced paints, and the artist's patron hires the PCs to 
transport it; however, thieves pressure the party to play a gambit or 
two with the exquisite cards.<br><br></li>
<li>An old acquaintance asks the changeling PC to substitute for him in tomorrow night's gold dragon match.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs notice a wanted poster for an illusionist who has cheated at cards in Karrnathi tournaments.<br><br></li>
<li>The party meets traveling wilderness profiteers and strike up a rousing game of copper-ante over drinks and a campfire.<br><br></li>
<li>Under pressure from the Church of the Silver Flame, Thrane lawmakers
 outlaw gambling within Thrane's borders, causing an influx of 
Three-Dragon Ante players into Aundair and Breland.<br><br></li>
<li>The Library of Korranberg plays host to a private collection of 
historically important Three-Dragon Ante decks, and it stages a festival
 of games for all comers.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs stumble upon a field of ceremonial burial mounds of 
lizardfolk, where each mound is adorned by stone markers carved with 
sequential draconic patterns -- an archaic form of the game?</li>
