<p align="LEFT">Religion, in any world, is responsible for a great deal 
of war, intolerance, and death. Because religion brings out differences 
in values and beliefs, conflicts arise. Where there is conflict, there 
is adventure. And thus, in a world with different competing religions, 
adventurers find a lot more possibilities for wealth and power. This 
month's hooks all relate to religion -- specifically the religions of 
Eberron. Yes, get ready for an all-Eberron set of hooks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because religion is complex, the rewards that religious 
employers can offer vary beyond the usual gold and magic. Priest can 
offer spells, access to secret knowledge, initiation into secret 
mysteries, and even access to forbidden magic. Consider rewards for your
 player characters that cost the church little but look very valuable 
when using churches to sponsor adventures.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Symbolic Power -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>

 in Aundair, is a large town between Fairhaven and Ghalt on the House 
Orien trade road. It is the largest town in that part of Aundair, and it
 serves as a trading center for the farmers who live in the countryside 
all around. The people are simple, for the most part, and follow the 
Sovereign Host. Their temple is run by Baltia Serontain, the ranking 
priestess of Boldrei in the nation. Baltia and the Vassals that serve 
with her keep the town safe and spiritually aware.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Baltia is the ranking priestess in Lathleer because she 
possesses a unique holy symbol that incorporates a Siberys dragonshard. 
By her own telling, she was led by Boldrei to this rare symbol; she did 
not seek it out herself. Nor did she seek out the position of importance
 that came with it, though she does not shirk from whatever service the 
Host requires.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This afternoon, people gathered for a ritual to ask 
Boldrei's favor on the construction of some new houses. They waited and 
waited. Finally another Vassal was sent and found Baltia unconscious in 
her private chambers within the temple. Her holy symbol was gone. 
Another Vassal filled in at the ritual, and soon Baltia's personal 
assistant was on the streets looking for adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 Baltia wants the symbol back because it has 
personal meaning to her; Boldrei led her to it and clearly intended that
 she safeguard it for the present.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-80 Baltia has been corrupted a little by her 
position, and she wants the symbol back as quietly as possible so that 
her position as ranking priest is not jeopardized.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds. <i>Faiths of Eberron</i>
 describes dragonshard holy symbols and the religion of the Sovereign 
Host in great detail. In other campaign worlds, you will need to create a
 holy symbol artifact of some kind, since the dragonshards don't 
translate well to other worlds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> The gods of Faerûn are 
ever-present, so this adventure can really go anywhere so long as you 
can supply the artifact holy symbol. Mulhorand or Unther might be really
 good choices though, since they are somewhat more theocratic than other
 places.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> You may have to strip the powers of 
the artifact holy symbol, but the basic concept should work in many 
locations, since religion is a strong force in most countries. If you 
place your campaign in the Middle East, you'll find that Islam has 
different factions (and factions of the same religion are one aspect of 
the adventure hook).</p>
</td>

<p align="LEFT">81-00 Baltia is dead, and this is a doppelganger that is
 replacing her. The doppelganger is worried that the theft, no matter 
whether the holy symbol is returned or not, will expose its position and
 the network of criminals that it is tied to, and it would like to avoid
 exposure. If it cannot, it will arrange for Baltia's "death" to divert 
suspicion from itself.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-25 Baltia was placed here deliberately by other 
clerics and the royal family. The Siberys dragonshard is keyed to rebuke
 members of House Cannith (or Orien, or whichever works for you) and 
Baltia was one link in Queen Aurala's secret force. She won't be pleased
 that someone discovered the secret of the dragonshard and stole it, but
 she might reward handsomely those who recover it, especially if no 
witnesses are left behind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">26-50 The dragonshard piece is part of a larger artifact
 that was broken off during the Age of Demons. Boldrei "placed it" in 
Baltia's keeping so that demons from Khyber would not find it. Some 
rakshasas have discovered its location and sent demons to retrieve it so
 they could rebuild the artifact.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 The artifact was stolen by Karrnathi agents of the
 Blood of Vol, who wanted to explore a lost House Cannith foundry at the
 edge of the Mournland. They believed that the holy symbol would give 
them power over the supposed traps that House Cannith left behind. The 
PCs have to chase the Emerald Claw and Blood of Vol villains through the
 foundry's passages and past construct defenders.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 The holy symbol was stolen by a rival faction of 
the Sovereign Host that wants to come into control of religion in 
Lathleer. These Vassals know that the holy symbol is what gives Baltia 
her status, and so without harming her they can remove her from "power" 
and attain power themselves simply by removing (and possibly destroying)
 the holy symbol. It is on the way to a place to be destroyed as the PCs
 investigate.</p>

 (14 Lharvion) is the holy day among followers of the Silver Flame that 
commemorates the lycanthropic purge. At Silver Flame temples across 
Khorvaire, festivals are held, dramas performed, and sermons preached. 
Aruldusk, in southeastern Thrane, is a small city that follows the 
Silver Flame devoutly and enjoys a measure of importance and rising 
prominence. The devotion is due to the nature of the Thranes there, and 
the rising prominence is due to the lightning rail that passes through 
the city on its way north and south.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The day of Silvertide in Aruldusk is a festive occasion,
 as it is everywhere. Youths of the church dramatize the important 
battles of the lycanthropic purge and display the greatness of the 
Purifieds that overcame the dread shapechangers. In the afternoon, 
people gather in front of the temple of the Silver Flame to hear the 
ranking priest, Ossul Desekhal, give an inspired sermon. Ossul steps 
from within the church and takes his place at a raised pulpit and raises
 his hands to silence the cheers that greet his appearance. And then, 
without a word, he disappears.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Panic ensues, and Purifieds begin using magic and 
interrogation to determine where Ossul has been taken. What they find is
 that there is no lingering magic that indicates Ossul was teleported, 
and he cannot be found anywhere in the vicinity even with <i>true seeing</i> spells. He simply vanished into thin air.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some members of the church, fearing that evil has 
infiltrated their midst, turn to good-aligned PCs to thwart this evil 
and recover their missing priest.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 A group of paladins contacts the PCs because the 
PCs are outside the situation. They are sincere in wanting Ossul back 
and in wanting to know what happened to him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 One of the priests did discover an illusion, and at the start of the sermon she cast <i>dispel magic</i>
 to expose the corruption she is certain has infested the church.

 directly.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds. <i>Faiths of Eberron</i> describes the churches of the Silver Flame and the Blood of Vol. Depending on where you take the adventure, you could find <i>Races of the Wild</i> useful, and if you take it into Khyber, then books on the Underdark will be most helpful.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> The Silver Flame is similar to the <b>Forgotten Realms </b>deity
 Tyr, but you could draw comparisons with Lathander, Torm, or Selûne as 
well. So, this adventure might go very well in Silverymoon or the 
Dalelands.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> An illusionary priest would be the

<p align="LEFT">76-00 Two priests discovered Ossul missing early in the 
day, and so they created* this illusion to prevent an uproar on the holy
 day. They fully intend to investigate Ossul's disappearance, but in 
secret. However, their power was not enough to maintain the illusion for
 as long as needed. Now that the focus of Ossul's disappearance has 
shifted, they contact the PCs to do the investigation they intended to 
do.</p>
<p align="LEFT">*If one of your complications has Ossul or someone else 
creating his own illusion, then you can decide whether the priests also 
discover the illusion or if they created the illusion to cover for 
Ossul.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 Ossul was an illusion, one created of magic and 
shadow-stuff from the Plane of Shadow. The real Ossul was kidnapped a 
week or so ago, and he is in the hand of priests of the Blood of Vol in 
Karrnath. He is alive, but soon may become an undead in service to Vol.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-65 Ossul was always a being of evil, either undead or
 possessed by a demon. He worked quietly to undermine the faith in 
Aruldusk, and he had made some progress. Last week, he became afraid 
that one of the priests had discovered his true nature and so he devised
 this means to escape before he was exposed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-85 There never was an Ossul Desekhal. A group of 
other priests created him as a figurehead through whom they could exert 
control (and focus on the evil they were interested in) without publicly
 being in charge.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 Ossul Desekhal is not missing at all. He arranged 
for the illusion of himself so that he could go on a secret mission to 
thwart some rakshasas from Khyber. The dispelling of the illusion 
creates problems for him as the PCs come after him and complicate his 
mission.</p>

 area around Vulyar, in southern Karrnath, is very rural, even though a 
House Orien trade road and a lightning rail line pass through the town. 
The area suffered a lot of damage during the Last War, and the military 
is still repairing roads, military facilities, and even town buildings. 
The force of warforged that are assigned to the garrison at Vulyar work 
under the orders of Captain Sigor Thul and his two squads of humanoid 
warriors.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some time ago, warforged began disappearing. At first 
the losses seemed to come from attacks, but the trickle of warforged 
became a slow flow, and Captain Thul is now worried that some enemy is 
picking off his force. Most of the disappearances occur in the rural 
areas where warforged work on the roads and local barns, but some 
warforged seem to disappear from within Vulyar itself.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Okay, there are no warforged in
 Faerûn, so you'd have to replace the warforged with some other race 
that would be enslaved, such as raptorans or goliaths or saurials, with 
the followers of the Lord of Blades replaced by sympathetic humans or 
elves. You could even set it in Thay using human slaves in the role of 
the warforged. Or, you could actually bring some warforged to Faerûn by 
having a ship of them crash near a civilization center. They might be 
considered as constructs rather than as people and put to work for that 
reason. The role of the followers of the Lord of Blades in this case 
might be followers of Gond who see them as wondrous sentient creations 
that should be free.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> Finding warforged in the world may be
 difficult, but there is no reason that they cannot appear. After all, 
other fantasy creatures can appear as shadow creatures in <b>Urban Arcana </b>campaigns.
 And there are other planets as well in a modern or future setting. But,
 you could easily replace them with some other kinds of self-aware 
robots (a la <i>Dr. Who</i>). The adventure might work best on another 
planet where robot slaves perform labor in areas that humans need gear 
just to survive.</p>

<p align="LEFT">After sending several warforged and three of his

adventurers with an offer of reward if they can find out what is

<p align="LEFT">91-00 Captain Thul hates warforged and would not mind at

that his superiors would take any cost of lost warforged out of his 
personal wealth or his hide.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 Just before the disappearances began, a warforged 
evangelist of the Lord of Blades arrived in Vulyar and began quietly 
proselytizing to the warforged assigned to Captain Thul. This warforged 
set up an underground railroad of sorts to smuggle warforged out of 
Karrnath and into the Mournland. Many of the warforged that have 
disappeared were converted to the cause of the Lord of Blades and sent 
away by this means.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 An effigy bulette, created by House Cannith near 
the end of the Last War, has been plaguing the farmers in the vicinity 
for a few weeks (or months) now. No one who has seen it has lived.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Some of the missing warforged were abducted by 
priests of the Blood of Vol. Vol and her followers are interested in 
trying to convert warforged into undead, especially the intelligent 
forms. The warforged could have been requisitioned from the military for
 experimentation, but these priests are working in secret and do not 
want to be found out.</p>
