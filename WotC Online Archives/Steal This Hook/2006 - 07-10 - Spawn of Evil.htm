<p align="LEFT">Sometimes the very environment presents opportunities 
for adventure... in general, however, anything that the natural world 
seems to offer itself often has some secret, intelligent design behind 
it. That's the case with the following adventure hooks: something in the
 natural world is really being caused by creatures of evil.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This month, <i>Steal This Hook </i>returns to its roots.
 The past couple of columns have offered what could more properly be 
called adventure "ideas," where the source was explained along with the 
hook itself. This month, the hooks are really hooks, with several 
different directions for adventure offered in the complications. The 
following hooks feature opportunities to introduce Spawns of Tiamat into
 your campaign, as described in <i>Monster Manual IV</i>. If you don't 
have this book, then you may need to alter the monsters (or just go get 
the book--hey, the spawns of Tiamat are pretty cool!).</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Haunted Wood -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2007-10%20-%20Spawn%20of%20Evil_files/dx0710sh_stealhook_greenspawn.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="322" width="243">The
 Wealdath, between Amn and Tethyr, is known for its fey defenders and 
tribes of elves. It is also the home of monsters and more than a few 
dragons. It is a large forest, though, and human settlements on the 
outskirts can scrape by... if there are not too many of them to offend 
the forest dwellers. One such village, Wayfarn, is close enough to Brost
 to be able to transport timber there. The villagers subsist on a 
low-grade timber industry, and live just beyond the reach of the 
forest's branches; they are used to the forest's normal inhabitants and 
take care to remain out of reach or on good terms, whichever works best.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The normal noises of the forest do not include ghostly 
moaning and recurring screams. Lately, however, these very sounds have 
been heard. Woodcutters working at the edge of the forest have reported 
strange haunting noises, even during the day, and periodic screams. A 
few hardy souls went to investigate the first time the sounds came, but 
did not return, nor did the people who went to look for them. The 
villagers now fear that some ghost treant, ghost dragon, or some other 
horrific creature is haunting this part of the forest, and they are now 
too afraid to do anything about it. Timber production is falling off, as
 the villagers don't know what parts of the wood are safe and what parts
 are haunted by this new danger.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Krovall Myersim, a merchant in Brost who deals in the 
timber from Wayfarn, has heard the stories from his suppliers and is 
very concerned. He seeks hardy souls not afraid of a few moans and 
groans to find the truth and restore timber production.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-40 Krovall is being aboveboard and is not hiding anything from the adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 41-80 Some of the villagers have been converted 
secretly to the worship of Tiamat by the Cult of the Dragon, and are not
 giving Krovall all the information that is available. The adventurers 
are in for some surprises.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 81-00 A group of dragonborn of Bahamut (see <i>Races of the Dragon</i>)
 has learned of the greenspawn presence and is watching it to see what 
the evil creatures are up to. Whether they are friend or foe to the 
adventurers depends on many factors.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-60 The haunting is caused by a new group of 
greenspawn leapers (or razorfiends, if you want higher level encounters)
 that have moved into the area. They are associated with the Cult of the
 Dragon and seek to extend Tiamat's dominion in the area.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 61-75 Fey creatures intent on keeping humans out of the
 Wealdath harass the adventurers throughout their mission, not wanting 
to kill them so much as drive them out of the forest.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 76-85 There are dragons in the forest that are not 
involved with the greenspawn, but would not like to be bothered or 
associated with the spawn activities.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 86-00 The sounds are being caused by a banshee (from <i>Monster Manual II</i>). The greenspawn razorfiends know that it is in the vicinity and use its presence to camouflage their own presence.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Treasure Marsh -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2007-10%20-%20Spawn%20of%20Evil_files/dx0710sh_stealhook_blackspawn.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="295" width="250">The
 Shadow Marches are a mysterious place where few dare go. Swampland 
covers much of the area, and reclusive orcs and humans populate the 
habitable places. House Tharashk controls interaction with the outside 
world through the port at Zarash'ak, but the inner parts of the area 
remain isolated. Only the large deposits of Eberron dragonshards draw 
any here at all.</p>
<p align="LEFT">House Orien would like to break House Tharashk's 
stranglehold on all commerce, and for the past 10 years or so has been 
working with the native orcs and humans to bypass House Tharashk 
controls. House Orien has established a trade road from the community of
 Patrahk'n to Zarash'ak to the south, and this connection has brought 
goods into Patrahk'n and has begun to raise the quality of life there. 
House Orien hopes to connect this road with their trade road in Droaam, 
and thus be able to move Eberron dragonshards out of the nation without 
House Tharashk interference.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The new trade road through the swamps is dangerous to 
travel, even with House Orien guards and patrols. Over the years, 
caravans have disappeared into the swamps, never to be seen again. House
 Orien counts on some small loss, and one or two caravans a year is 
within their acceptable limits.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This past year, it has been dry in parts of the Shadow 
Marches, and the swamp has receded a bit. Rumors started of the lost 
caravans resurfacing when a lone orc staggered into Patrahk'n claming to
 have found a huge pile of wagons loaded with dragonshards. He even had a
 dragonshard or three to validate his claim. Unfortunately, he'd 
wandered for days in the swamps and did not remember the exact location 
of the wagons. Since then, several groups have gone into the swamps 
looking for them, but to no avail. The swamps of the Shadow Marches are 
loathe to give up their secrets, even when receded.</p>
<p align="LEFT">House Orien is especially interested in finding the 
wagons, and more importantly discovering what happened so that they can 
make the roads safer. House Tharashk is also interested, chiefly so they
 can claim the lost dragonshards and force House Orien out of the 
Marches. Both can afford to bring in adventurers to look into the 
problem.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms</b>: This adventure works well in 
Mortik Swamp, down by Luiren, or even in the Akhkaur Swamp by Lapaliiya.
 Blackspawn raiders would be well at home in the far south, near where a
 very powerful black dragon wizard lives in Rethild, the Great Swamp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic</b>: Set this in a place where civilization 
has to bypass or cross a swamp, moor, or wetlands area conducting trade 
between nations or cities or feudal lords. The blackspawn raiders are 
trying to disrupt the trade.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern</b>: The Florida Everglades are a good 
place for this adventure, as they are sometimes dry and sometimes very 
wet and impassable. There are communities on all sides, so travel across
 or around the swamps is common. The blackspawn raiders could have come 
through a gate from some fantasy world, and may just be discovering the 
nature of their new world through the goods they take from the trucks 
they attack.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-75 House Orien or House Tharashk (or both) wants the
 adventurers to find the lost caravan wagons. House Orien wants to know 
what happened to them, but House Tharashk is less interested unless the 
knowledge can be used against House Orien.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 76-90 Envoys from the Daughters of Sora Kell approach 
the heroes about investigating the rumors of the treasure wagons. Not 
only would they like the dragonshards, but they had hopes for increased 
trade once the House Orien trade road connected Droaam with Zarash'ak. 
They say they would like to see the trade road go forward, and helping 
House Orien in this matter would ease the way toward what they want.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 91-00 A band of local orcs hooks up with the 
adventurers to help them find the wagons so that the dragonshards can be
 returned to the ground where they came from. These orcs--druids and 
rangers mostly--believe in the Draconic Prophecy, and are sure that the 
deposits of dragonshards relate in some important way. The keys to part 
of the Prophecy may be lost if more dragonshards are taken out of the 
Shadow Marches.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-50 The caravan wagons were attacked and raided by 
groups of blackspawn raiders that live deep in the swamps. They were not
 threatened until the House Orien trade road was established. Further, 
their natural desire to kill dragonmarked beings leads them to try to 
disrupt House Orien efforts as much as possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 51-65 Orcs loyal to the Daughters of Sora Kell are also
 seeking the lost wagons, as the Daughters of Sora Kell had wanted to 
steal the dragonshard shipments once they began coming through Droaam. 
The orcs could be accompanied by blackspawn stalkers, chuuls, medusas 
from Droaam, or even wyverns.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 66-80 The Shadow Marches are full of manifest zones 
between Eberron and Xoriat (the Realm of Madness), and between Eberron 
and Kythri (the Churning Chaos). Monsters from these places could have 
recently come through and attacked the caravans.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 81-00 Will o'wisps haunt the swamps as well, feeding 
off the fears of the local orcs and monsters. The House Orien trade road
 has opened up more feeding possibilities, and they have begun to 
cluster toward the road.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Note: you might find the sample blackspawn raider encampment from <i>Monster Manual IV</i> useful for this adventure.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Burning Wood -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2007-10%20-%20Spawn%20of%20Evil_files/dx0710sh_stealhook_redspawn.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="197" width="250">The
 Forgotten Forest is a small patch of woods some 90 miles long and 30 
miles wide. It is a fragment of the great forest that covered this part 
of Faerûn ages ago, and is now home to reclusive treants that protect it
 and mourn the loss of the rest of the forestland. Very little happens 
in the forest that the treant guardians cannot handle, and visitors are 
rarely welcomed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some 20 miles away lies the elven city of Evereska, the 
last large settlement of moon and sun elves in Faerûn. One night, the 
adventurers visiting this elven stronghold see an orange glow coming 
from the Forgotten Forest. As folks begin to wonder what magic is 
causing it, a fey creature reaches Evereska and claims that the forest 
is on fire. The fire is spreading out of control; when the treants and 
druids puts out one conflagration, the fire erupts in a new place. They 
don't have time to track down why this is happening, and the treants 
have reluctantly asked the elves of Evereska for assistance. The elves 
immediately begin relief and search-and rescue plans, and draft the 
adventurers to help with or without their consent (they don't force the 
adventurers to help; they just assume that the adventurers will help and
 start including them in the plans). If necessary, the elves will offer 
rewards (perhaps on behalf of the treants) for the adventurers' 
assistance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once in the forest, the adventurers discover that the 
woods have been burned beyond what anyone imagined. Miles and miles of 
trees are ablaze, with treants and fey creatures desperately working to 
stem the tide of flames. Soon after the elves and adventurers begin work
 to control the fire (or soon after the adventures begin to seek out the
 reason for the blaze), a new area of trees suddenly bursts into flames.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds. <i>Races of the Wild</i> will give you information on elves in general, and you should consult page 87 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for information on handling forest fires. Once the heroes move into the Graypeak Mountains, you might find <i>Races of Stone</i> useful as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron</b>: The Eldeen Reaches are a natural 
location for this adventure, as the treants and other necessary 
creatures are present and the redspawn creatures could be moving through
 looking for enemies of Tiamat. Redspawn firebelchers live in Xen'drik, 
so that continent is a good setting as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic</b>: Ideally, you should create a forest with
 treant occupants next to a hill or mountain range with a city somewhere
 close by. If not, a town or village will work for the city, and the 
mountains are not required as the redspawn arcaniss and firebelchers 
don't live in mountains. The forest fire, on a grand scale, is the 
centerpoint of the hook.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern</b>: There are a lot of possibilities for 
this hook in the modern world. Forests in Africa or North America are 
perfect, but forests in Europe work just as well. Modern day 
firefighting tactics and equipment should change the flow of the 
adventure somewhat, as the fire can be brought under control faster than
 in a fantasy world. The redspawn creatures would be Shadow creatures 
brought through a gate in the center of the forest or in some nearby 
corporate facility from which they escaped.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-50 The treants are desperate for help. They are not hiding anything, and they are not causing the fire.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 51-80 A faction of the elves believes the treants have 
turned evil and need to be purged. Though they did not start the fire, 
these elves would use it to accomplish their goals of purifying the 
Forgotten Forest. These elves slow relief efforts and hinder 
firefighting as subtly as they can. Whether the treants really are evil 
or not doesn't matter; the elves could be corrupted and the treants 
innocent, and they would still hinder the rescue efforts.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 81-00 The Black Network introduced redspawn 
firebelchers to the forest to cause this destruction as a way to weaken 
both the forest creatures and the elves of Evereska. While the elves are
 focused on this fire catastrophe, the Zhentarim are pulling off some 
other plan.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-75 The fires are caused by a group of redspawn 
firebelchers that are hunting. They are the guard animals of a group of 
redspawn arcanisses based in the southeast part of the Graypeak 
Mountains at present. The whole group is moving through, but the 
firebelchers needed to stop here and eat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 76-85 Deep within the forest lives a half-dragon (red) 
treant of immense age and power. Normally it shuns the other treants, as
 they fear it, but the fires have attracted it. Though a treant, it is 
dominated by its draconic heritage and wants to see all forests 
destroyed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 86-00 Within the Graypeak Mountains, redspawn 
arcanisses and firebelchers are at war with a group of evil stone 
giants. Though both sides are evil, the collateral damage from the 
fighting is affecting other creatures that need protection. That is the 
cause of the fire; spillover from a large battle.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alternate Rewards</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The heroes could be offered a number of rewards from the
 elves and treants for their assistance. Straight cash or magic items 
could be dull though, so consider these options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elven wizards could offer adventuring spellcasters access to rare spells that only the elves know.</li>
<li>Elven smiths could offer to make elven chain mail or special weapons for the adventurers, in lieu of gold.</li>
<li>An elven sage could offer his only copy of a treasure map to an old 
elven treasure chamber deep within Myth Drannor, sparking the heroes to 
investigate the greatest dungeon in all Faerûn.</li>
<li>The treants could offer to grant aid in reaching an old wise druid 
that lives deep within the Forgotten Forest, should the heroes need or 
want to speak with him. This works well if you set up the druid as the 
reason the heroes are in the region in the first place.</li>
<li>Deep within the forest lies a <i>portal</i> that leads to the key to a powerful lost Netherese artifact. The treants keep the location of the <i>portal</i> secret even from the elves, but will show the heroes where it is and how to use it in return for their help.</li>
