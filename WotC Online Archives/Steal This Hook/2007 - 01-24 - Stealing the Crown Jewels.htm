<p align="LEFT">Scoundrels are not always thieves, but thieves are 
usually always scoundrels. Whether they are the elite cat burglars that 
steal high-end valuables or the second-story men and women who steal 
whatever they can carry, or the footpads that hold up people in alleys, 
thieves hold a somewhat romantic place in cultural thought. Like 
pirates, they don't deserve it. This month, we hook your PCs into 
adventures involving thieves and thefts.</p>

 the capital of Aundair, is one of the most active and cosmopolitan 
cities in all of Khorvaire. Only Sharn and a few others rival it. In 
this massive metropolis, almost anything can happen. With a thriving 
underworld, the royal government of Aundair, a university on the 
rebound, dragonmarked enclaves, and merchant powers, the possibilities 
are endless.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One day, when the PCs are meeting with a business 
contact, authorities come to arrest the business contact for theft. The 
business contact claims innocence and can provide an alibi (that cannot 
be confirmed). Inquiry under a <i>zone of truth</i> spell shows that the
 accused really remembers being somewhere else at the time of the theft.
 An eyewitness, however, places the accused at the scene of the crime at
 the time of the theft. The accused believes he (or she) is being framed
 and railroaded for some business reason, and asks for help.</p>

around some distant planet in a <b>d20 Future</b> campaign.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-40 The business contact is sincere and needs help, and he or she hides nothing from the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-90 The business contact made the Will save against the <i>modify memory</i> (if that complication is used), and remembers what happened (and made the save for the <i>zone of truth</i>,
 too). The business contact is afraid to say anything for fear of being 
killed, and it takes a lot of convincing or magical probing to reveal 
what this person knows.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The business contact is the bard mastermind behind
 the crimes, and he or she is allaying any future suspicion by setting 
himself or herself up as a victim. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-45 The mastermind behind the crimes is a bard enchanter who uses <i>dominate person</i> to have other innocents commit thefts that would be easy for them, and then uses <i>modify memory</i> to remove the memory of the crime and substitute another.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-60 This is not the first crime, and other "minions" 
with modified memories live in the cities. The PCs have to find some of 
them to piece together enough information to find the mastermind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-65 The mastermind bard is a friend of the PCs -- 
perhaps a contact from a past adventure. He or she has been very helpful
 to them, such that they would be unwilling to believe the bard could be
 behind the crimes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-75 The bard is being controlled or forced by another 
person or creature (perhaps a vampire or the ghost of a relative) to 
have these crimes committed. If the bard is eliminated, the crimes stop 
only for a short time while the real mastermind finds another pawn.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-90 The crimes are being perpetrated by doppelgangers 
or changelings, and the business contact really was not at the crime 
scene. Proving that could be very difficult seeing as he or she cannot 
prove the alibi.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The whole crime spree is a ruse to draw in the 
PCs. The bard mastermind is a pleasure devil in disguise and wants to 
corrupt the PC cleric. Devils committed the thefts, and they designed 
every step of the investigation to lead the PC cleric or paladin down a 
path of spiritual corruption. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Quick, Duck in Here -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sharn, the City of Towers, is more than it appears in 
many ways. Layer upon layer of the city reach from the shores of the 
Dagger River up to the skies above the thousand-foot cliffs against 
which the city rests. In addition, magical rooms exist within towers, 
and more than one wizard (or powerful person with a wizard henchperson) 
maintains a more or less permanent <i>magnificent mansion</i> (known in Greyhawk as a <i>Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion</i>) with access to walkways or gardens in the better parts of the city.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Morgrave University received a unique package from a 
group of commissioned explorers the night before last via House Orien 
fast transport means. The next night, as the PCs leave a tavern or other
 such nighttime entertainment business, they see a group of people 
running through the streets carrying something covered in a tarp. It 
looks large and heavy. They run up (or down) two levels and then into a 
garden, and stop in the middle of a walkway. One of them makes some 
gestures and a faint shimmer appears in the air (visible in the light of
 a <i>continual flame</i> sculpture nearby). The people all run through 
the shimmer and disappear. So does the shimmer. Seconds later, cries of 
"Thief!!" ring out across the city, and booted footsteps move toward the
 garden (actually, they go everywhere).</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You could choose to design a mansion that connects 
different campaign worlds. Thus, the thieves could be operating on 
different campaign worlds at the same time, and pursuers from the 
Forgotten Realms could be looking for a different valuable than those on
 Eberron. <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953867200"><i>Cityscape</i></a> may help flesh out the world outside the magnificent mansion, and <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/956847200"><i>Dungeonscape</i></a> (due out in February) could really help you create the internal world of the mansion. Don't forget the servants.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Waterdeep, Athkatla in Amn, anywhere in Thay, or Skuld in Mulhorand are good locations for this adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> Large trading centers are the most 
likely locations for this adventure, but powerful wizards that like to 
show off their magic are also needed to create the <i>magnificent mansion</i> (plus any tweaks to the effect you wish to introduce). Pick a large city where wizards live. You probably have one.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> The <i>magnificent mansion</i> is a magical construction unheard-of in the <b>d20 Modern</b>
 setting, where no one can cast the spell required to make one. Thus, 
there must be a wizard from a fantasy world involved -- one who knows 
spells beyond what normal magic in <b>d20 Modern</b> allows. Such a 
person could live anywhere, but probably lives in London, New York, or 
Shanghai, where he or she can get "lost in the crowd."</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-60 Morgrave University is horrified and upset at the 
loss of the artifact. They want it back and provide all the help they 
can.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-85 Scholars at Morgrave determined that the artifact 
has magical powers that no one should know about, and they are very 
cagey about what the artifact is, where it came from, or what it does. 
They do want it back, though.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-95 One of the scholars at Morgrave University arranged the theft and is connected to the owner of the <i>magnificent mansion</i> where the thieves hid.</p>
<p align="LEFT">96-00 The artifact carries a curse, and a demon or devil
 has replaced one of the scholars working on the device. That demon 
wants the artifact because it can help release demons from Khyber. It 
could be a fiend possessing a scholar or a fiend that has killed and 
impersonated a scholar. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-25 The owner of the <i>magnificent mansion</i> is 
behind the theft, and she has allowed the thieves access to it. The 
thieves actually plan to form a great guild of thieves that use the <i>mansion</i> as a base (woe to them if someone dispels it).</p>
<p align="LEFT">26-55 The master thief used Use Magic Device to activate someone else's <i>magnificent mansion</i>, effectively stealing the <i>mansion</i> too. The <i>mansion</i> within is large enough that the thieves and the real owners don't run into each other (indeed, the real owner is rarely there).</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-70 The artifact is stored in the <i>mansion</i>, and the creator cannot be found, so the PCs have to break into the <i>magnificent mansion</i> to recover the artifact.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-90 The <i>mansion</i> has a flaw: a rift into another plane. Monsters from that plane are getting into the <i>mansion</i> and will find their way into the city soon enough. The theft is not the only problem the PCs face.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 The <i>magnificent mansion</i> has an unusual trait: It opens into some odd places and includes an exit to the world of Greyhawk. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2001-24%20-%20Stealing%20the%20Crown%20Jewels_files/stealhook_jewel2.jpg" align="right" border="0">Suzail,
 capital of Cormyr, is one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities 
in the entire Realms, and it serves as the home of Cormyrean royalty. As
 one might expect, it is also the home (sometimes, anyway) of the crown 
jewels. Most kings have crown jewels, after all. They are a mark of 
status. They are also well guarded. However, in a world that includes 
both innovative criminals and magic, no security is good enough.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One morning, rumors begin to circulate that the crown 
jewels are missing. No one knows anything, but everyone is willing to 
speculate and make up things that sound good. Later in the morning, and 
over the next several days, people begin asking questions. Not all of 
these people wear the uniforms of law enforcement. Everyone feels the 
heat, including the PCs, who are in town between adventures. Eventually,
 someone is arrested. That is when the adventure hits home for the PCs.</p>

<p align="LEFT">This kind of adventure can take place anywhere there are crown jewels to be stolen. You could take advantage of the material in <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179280000"><i>Cityscape</i></a>, but then again you might want to use <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179280000"><i>Races of the Wild</i></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/965670000"><i>Races of Stone</i></a>, or some world-specific publication instead.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Since all of the Five Nations are ruled 
by descendents of the Galifar kings, all are royalty and would have 
crown jewels somewhere. Pick your favorite among the Five Nations. I 
like Thrane and Aundair.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> You need a country with some crown 
jewels, though the rulers don't have to be royalty. A merchant ruler 
without a title could have crown jewels of some kind too. A large city 
setting is ideal for this adventure -- usually the largest in the 
campaign region works best.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> Of course London is the most obvious 
choice for this adventure. Where else has so much been told about the 
Crown Jewels? Heck, there was an episode of the old Batman TV series 
that had the Crown Jewels as the main target of the villains. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-30 The royal family wants the jewels back as quickly 
as possible, and they don't care what happens to the thieves. This could
 lead to quick "vigilante" justice or to the thieves being able to work a
 deal.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-50 The royal family wants vengeance on the thieves 
more than they want the jewels back. They can always replace jewels, but
 they must show the world that they won't tolerate thieves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 A member of the royal family is behind the thefts 
in some way, and he wants the crime blamed on scapegoats so that the 
questions die down and the jewels are not recovered.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 Rivals of the royal family want to use the theft 
as a destabilizing incident, though that is difficult with the popular 
family of late King Azoun IV. Nonetheless, these rivals try to make an 
incident of it. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-40 The PCs are the ones arrested, or some of the more
 roguish ones are taken into custody. The PCs are innocent, but the real
 thieves planted enough evidence to lay the blame on "foreigner 
adventurers." The PCs not arrested have to solve the case.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-55 The PCs really did commit the crime. You may have 
to give them a motivation for doing so that fits their morals, and then 
again you may not. In either case, have the adventure start with the 
theft and proceed to the investigation. The PCs may have to turn 
themselves in, or lay the blame on someone else, or just leave town and 
not come back. If this won't work with your group of player characters, 
feel free to try another result.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-85 Someone on the shady side of the law thinks the PCs are involved and begins pressuring them (in classic film style; see <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> for ideas) to turn the jewels over. Whether the PCs have the jewels or not is not relevant.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 The theft was the "final exam" of some thieves 
from Night Masks from Westgate who are under new leadership. As part of 
their disguise, they magically took on the appearances of one or more of
 the PCs, having determined that the PCs are "traveling through" and 
therefore likely to be gone soon. </p>
