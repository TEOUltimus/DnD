This edition's theme is <i>found in an old book</i>:
 adventure hooks that begin with someone cracking open the pages of a 
careworn tome, for good or for ill. (Hey, who are we kidding? Of course 
it's for ill). Unleash one or more of these on your players, and show 
them that ignorance may in fact be bliss!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Blank Codex</b></p>
<p align="left">The uncle of one of the PCs dies and leaves his 
adventuring nephew or niece a curious old codex bound in leather and 
locked with a <i>keycharm</i> (<i>Shadows of the Last War</i>, pg. 24). 
The cover has no title but is decorated with circular sigils. When they 
get it open, its pages are blank -- yet the book radiates magic! It 
turns out that each page is written with a special kind of <i>illusory script</i>:
 unreadable unless certain conditions are met. Some of the pages are 
time-based: one becomes readable when the plane of Dolurrh is waxing, 
for example. Others are based on characteristics of the reader: only 
elves or those with the Mark of Handling can read certain pages. </p>
<p align="left">What can be read there? The book is the journal of a wizard and Last War veteran in the uncle's family (the wizard's <i>arcane mark</i>
 is probably on it somewhere). The wizard traveled extensively and saw 
many wonders and mysteries, making the book a gold mine of potential 
adventures. Now that it has emerged, the book may also draw attention to
 the heroes. A representative of House Sivis would pay handsomely for 
such a work of scribing; enemies of the old wizard may try to steal it; 
and an obsessed cultist who believes it may contain a map to a protected
 seal may threaten or kill the heroes for it.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Henge in the Gloaming</b></p>
<p align="left">In the Eldeen city of Xandrar, Gatekeeper druids are 
concerned about signs that the poaching of good creatures in the 
Towering Wood has increased. They ask the PCs for help investigating 
these crimes against their faith. It turns out that someone has been 
buying up pixie wings, giant eagle feathers, and unicorn horns, and 
payment has always been in the form of letters of credit from Morgrave 
University. </p>
<p align="left">Meanwhile, in the thickest, darkest, most claustrophobic
 grove of The Gloaming, a Druidic Studies student and his horrid ape 
companions work tirelessly to build... something. They fell trees. They 
move huge, oblong stones. They arrange a collection of wings, feathers, 
and horns on a rune-covered stone slab, following exactly the diagrams 
and directions in a set of Old Galifar scrolls titled <i>A Dialectical Discussion of the Planes</i>,
 by Professor Uric Helbaine, paying special attention to the third 
scroll: "Musings concerning the Early-Walkers and their Connection with 
Mabar." The heroes must not only confront the misguided student but also
 deal with the disastrous consequences of focusing the Gloaming's 
negative energies through the mystical henge dreamed up by the long-dead
 Professor Helbaine.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Almanac of Tomorrow</b></p>
<p align="left">In a dungeon beneath the Mournlands, the heroes discover
 a chamber full of loose parchment pages (note: fire hazard!). Buried 
under the pages are the remains of a magical almanac that adds a new 
page to itself each day. Years ago, the book's cover burst under the 
strain of the stream of new pages, and now the dungeon room is packed 
with them. Each page carries the date it was created and makes 
predictions about what will happen <i>tomorrow</i> (that's tomorrow from
 the day the page was created). They predict weather patterns, casualty 
numbers, troop movements, and other significant events.</p>
<p align="left">The most recent page reports that a disaster will occur 
tomorrow, and the heroes may be able to prevent it! Perhaps it reports 
that, despite the Last War being over, tomorrow's "casualty numbers" are
 in the hundreds, and it states "Cyre" is moving troops toward the 
border of Thrane (which could mean the Lord of Blades is planning an 
attack). Perhaps it reports a weather disaster brought on by a rogue 
member of House Lyrandar. It may report pestilence and famine that the 
heroes know to be caused by an evil curse. </p>
<p align="left">The almanac loses accuracy if it is removed from the 
dungeon chamber but still produces useful information. Investigating its
 origin might lead to further adventures.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Expedition of the Tome of Glyphs</b></p>
<p align="left">The heroes' patron informs them of rumors that the true 
Tome of Glyphs, a legendary book detailing the history of giants in 
Xen'drik, may be located in a dungeon in the misty jungles of Q'barra. 
An archaeologist and linguist of Sharn, Brenna Dowen, will accompany the
 adventurers and help them follow a set of clues to the whereabouts of 
the dungeon.</p>
<p align="left">At the dungeon entrance, they find the deserted camp of a
 rival expedition. They may be too late! Inside the dungeon, the party 
comes upon a hexagonal chamber containing six enormous books (each about
 the size of a noble's bed) on heavy display stands. Which is the right 
one? Bloody smears on the floor lead to one wall. Then the books attack!
 The party has been lured into the lair of six mimics (or whatever 
number your PCs can handle). The previous expedition was subdued or 
destroyed, and their remains are poorly hidden behind a secret door at 
the end of the trail of blood. Is the real Tome of Glyphs somewhere in 
this dungeon, or was a crafty illithid using the legend to lure 
adventurers into its mimic-lair? Perhaps Brenna Dowen tricked the party 
for her own reasons.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Monsters in the Library Basement</b></p>
<p align="left">Mr. Pumble Dombibbin, a night clerk at the Library of 
Korranberg, calls the adventurers' for help one moonless evening. He 
trapped two monsters in the bottom floor of the Library, which houses 
books in storage. Only the heavy door leading to the stairwell has kept 
them at bay. Dombibbin has no explanation for how the monsters got into 
the Library; he just wants them captured and removed. He insists they 
not be killed and will give the heroes a handsome reward if they succeed
 quickly. </p>
<p align="left">The PCs stalk the monsters among the dark corridors and 
dusty stacks. Behind an iron door labeled "Rare Books," whose lock is 
broken, they come face-to-face with a pair of fihyrs (<i>Monster Manual II</i>,
 or substitute any aggressive monsters with appropriate CR). The fihyrs 
are actually Mr. Dombibbin's sons, ages 12 and 10. There were 
accidentally transformed by a spell they read out of a nearby tome. The 
spell affected their minds, too, so they believe themselves to be 
ferocious fihyrs. Mr. Dombibbin knows what happened but he will be in 
big trouble if his employers find out he allowed his boys to play in the
 stacks. He believes he can reverse the spell if the PCs trap the 
monstrous boys and recover the book they read.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Mini-Hooks </b></p>
<p align="left">Still hungry for more adventure hooks? Here are some bite-sized book-themed ideas to chew on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">What appears to be a book of spells is actually a recipe
 for an extended magical ritual to call down meteors from the Ring of 
Siberys -- with the power to destroy an entire city.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">In the ruins of a half-sunk Shadow Marches temple, the 
heroes discover a set of stone tablets describing the location of an 
ancient artifact related to the daelkyr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">A book of poetry with pages of fine vellum is found at 
an estate sale. The author turns out to be the personal scribe of old 
King Jarot. It could be full of clues of historical import, coveted by 
many nations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">A financial ledger in the Mror Holds reveals evidence 
that an underground organization seized a huge amount of resources 
through shrewd, almost prophetic business deals. Perhaps the Aurum has 
enslaved an earth weird to guide their business practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">The PCs are hired to steal a book from a private 
collection. The book itself is unimportant but it contains a magic 
dagger hidden in a hollowed-out space in the center pages, and the 
dagger is happy to be free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">A student of the magical arts must finish her 
dissertation on necromantic phenomena before her academic deadline. She 
needs the heroes to bring her tissue or bone samples of at least three 
specific undead creatures within one week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left">A famous novel is delivered to one of the PCs -- with a message from the author penned in blood inside the front cover.</p>
</li>
</ul>
