<p align="LEFT">When devils get involved with a scheme, the complexity 
of it all spirals almost beyond mortal imagining. And this is not 
surprising, as hell is perhaps the greatest bureaucracy in all of 
existence. All the devils plan and plot and try to outplot each other 
without being, in turn, outplotted. This month, the new <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953877200">Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of Hell</a></i>
 comes out, and boy is it cool. It contains a whole lot on devils, 
including a section on playing devils and some information about the 
deviousness of devilish plots. Thus, this month's hooks all involve 
devils in some way. So enjoy, and we may see you again next year. Unless
 the devils get us, that is.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Devils from the Sea -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2012-18%20-%20Devilish%20Doings_files/dx20061218_sahuagin.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="291" width="225">Ravens
 Bluff has been called the City of Adventurers, because almost nowhere 
else on all of Faerûn will you find so many in one place. The Vast is a 
dangerous place, and something always happens that requires a hero. This
 night is no exception. The PCs are walking the docks of the city, 
perhaps looking to spend the evening at the unique underwater bar called
 Sharkey's. The sea, however, comes to them as dark shapes rise from the
 waters and move into the pools of light created by the street lamps. 
They also swarm the ships tied to the docks, and start killing 
everything that walks on land. The creatures, sahuagin, seem driven to 
recklessness and their attack has a ferocity not normally reported for 
sahuagin attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once the PCs have helped drive the devils of the sea 
back beneath the waves, they are approached by Corwin Stark, a 
representative of the Merchant's Guild. Stark invites them into a 
tavern, and in true Ravens Bluff style seeks their help in preventing 
further attacks. This is the second, he reports, in the last month. He 
has wealth to offer, but he also knows that the sahuagin probably have 
wealth too, and the less he can offer the PCs the better.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sahuagin raids are pretty common in any campaign world 
in which the creatures exist. Here are some suggestions for other 
campaigns. You may find <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/178670000">Stormwrack</a></i> very useful for the underwater part of the adventure, and <i>Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of Hell</i>
 can help with the general tactics of devils. If you actually use Ravens
 Bluff as the setting, you might want to get your hands on <i>LC4: Port of Ravens Bluff</i> (a very old TSR publication) for information about the dockside businesses. <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953867200">Cityscape</a></i> could also be useful in this regard.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Sahuagin are prominent underneath the main water approach to Xen'drik, so that might be a good place for this adventure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> A coast near a sahuagin settlement is 
all you need. It doesn't even have to be a coast, since the sahuagin 
could be raiding ships or floating cities or small island communities. 
Having some aquatic elves nearby could add some complications.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> I can picture sahuagin living in the 
Ring of Fire area of the Pacific, so perhaps Japan would be a good site 
for this adventure. Or Australia.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-40 The merchants are sincere; they really want the attacks prevented.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-65 One merchant has made an alliance with the sahuagin and is using them against his or her rivals.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-85 The Merchant's Guild senior members really want to
 enslave the sahuagin, and think they can do so. They want the PCs to 
find the sahuagin and report their location.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 Some demons led by an aspect of Demogorgon, along 
with some ixitachitl, are working against the sahuagin, but don't want 
interference from the PCs either.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 The sahuagin raids, which have happened all along 
the coast of the Vast as well as in Sembia, are motivated by the 
presence of an aspect of Sekolah (watch for the web enhancement for <i>Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of Hell</i>
 on the Wizards website), the sharklike god of the sahuagin. He is 
driving the creatures to show greater devotion to their devilish god.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 The raids have been undertaken by different clans 
of sahuagin. Each of the clans involved is raiding the surface for 
weapons and wealth to use in the conflict in which the clans are 
involved. If not stopped, the conflict could devastate cities along the 
Sea of Fallen Stars.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-90 Groups of aquatic ghouls are following the sahuagin and using the chaos of the attacks to claim weakened victims to eat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 A blue dragon is stirring up conflict among the 
sahuagin, and then picking them off slowly as they return from their 
raids with loot. Thus, the dragon increases its treasure hoard. [You 
might want the blue dragon to be Gargantuan, so you can use the new <b>D&amp;D</b> Icons Gargantuan blue dragon mini coming out in January.]</p>

 the bridges that make up the "streets" of Sharn can be dangerous. 
Things can happen to you at any time -- especially at night when fog 
obscures the way on the upper walkway levels. This particular night, the
 PCs are on their way through the fog to somewhere when they hear a 
muffled scream and then a thunk. Running to the scene, they find either 
nothing at all or track marks of someone being dragged away, or maybe 
even a couple people dragging someone away.</p>
<p align="LEFT">They later find that a number of people have disappeared
 in the last few months in different ways. It's hard to determine 
exactly how many are connected because lots of people disappear in 
Sharn, but they eventually find a common link with enough of the victims
 to see that there is something going on.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs are not interested in looking into the one 
incident they (almost) witnessed, then a day or so after telling someone
 about it they are approached by the wife of a merchant who disappeared 
two months ago. She wants to hire them to find out what happened to her 
husband, and she hopes that there is some connection between her 
husband's disappearance and what the PCs told that they saw.</p>

 of this adventure, though you could make the city part smaller and move
 the action to the wilderness. In that case, <i>Races of the Wild</i> or one of the environment-series books might be useful to you. And, of course, the two <i>Fiendish Codex</i> books should help if you play up the demon/devilish aspects.</p>

<p align="LEFT">01-30 The merchant's wife, if she comes into it, is sincere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-60 The merchant's wife is a devil in disguise (or a 
demon, depending on who is behind the kidnappings). This creature does 
want the PCs to solve the disappearances, because that weakens the other
 side's current plan without any effort on the outsider's part.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-75 Law enforcement officers don't want the PCs 
involved, and they hinder the PCs as much as is reasonably possible. One
 of the victims is a high-profile NPC and this person (or someone else 
close to the NPC) doesn't want certain details to come out.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 The merchant's wife is a cultist who hires the 
PCs. Then the cult kidnaps anyone the PCs talk to, so that all the 
disappearances can be blamed on the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-40 Glasya, recently made an archdevil, seeks more 
power to use in the manipulative games that archdevils play. She hopes 
to open a large <i>portal</i> from Shavarath to Eberron and pull a whole
 city into the plane of endless conflict. This she would add to her 
realm. She needs a lot of hearts to be sacrificed to complete the spell,
 and her cult in Sharn has been collecting them. Over sixty people are 
imprisoned in the abandoned levels at the bottom of one of the oldest 
towers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-55 In addition to the above, a demon lord has learned
 of the plan and wishes to co-opt the whole endeavor at the last minute 
and steal the city out of Glaysa's grasp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-65 A cult that thinks it is following a devil is 
actually enslaved to a rakshasa. This creature is trying to free one of 
the greater rakshasas from its imprisonment in Khyber, and it needs 
living victims to do so.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-85 Whoever is behind the kidnappings, the PCs are the
 final planned sacrifices. They are being drawn into the adventure by 
false information so that they come to false conclusions. At the "final"
 battle, if they are slain because they have miscalculated the 
opposition, whatever ritual the DM has chosen is completed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 The Blood of Vol is stealing the victims from the kidnappers and making them into vampire servants of Vol.</p>

 south of the Western Heartlands, is a bustling but small town on the 
road between Waterdeep and Scornubel. A lot of trade passes through the 
town, but since it is not an endpoint, the merchants there do not see as
 much wealth as they might in Scornubel. The town has a direct road to 
Elturel, so folk can make some money by means other than service 
industries.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Lord Mayor of Triel constantly schemes to bring more
 money into the city and more prestige to himself. Aside from a lot of 
raw talent, he is blessed (sort of) with a beautiful daughter named 
Melomine, who has a reputation for hanging with a lower class of crowd 
than her father would want. She also has a certain reputation among the 
young men. One evening, just after the PCs arrive in town, she returns 
from a party to her father's house and disappears. Tracks at the scene 
show that her coach stopped and a number of ogres surrounded it. No 
human tracks leave the area, but two of the ogres were carrying 
something heavy. A few drops of blood fell between the tracks as they 
led out town.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The following morning, the lord mayor's chamberlain 
finds the PCs where they are staying and hires them to find the missing 
girl. He offers either money or a part interest in a business venture 
that the lord mayor has just started.</p>

<p align="LEFT">01-40 The lord mayor is sincere in wanting his daughter back, and the chamberlain does not lie to the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-60 The lord mayor sold his daughter, who was too loose for his reputation to bear, to the ogres to pay off a debt.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-80 Merchants in Elturel are responsible for the 
kidnapping, and they plan to use the girl as leverage to acquire 
controlling interest in the lord mayor's newest venture.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 The lord mayor is sincere, but he is afraid that a
 political rival is behind the kidnapping. He doesn't want to be forced 
into an awkward situation and will sacrifice the girl, but he wants to

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-35 Melomine is actually a pleasure devil (see <i>Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of Hell</i>)
 and has been for some time. The real Melomine was killed over a year 
ago, and the pleasure devil has been using her identity to corrupt the 
local priests and law officials. That is why Melomine is known to be 
somewhat loose with her affections. She wants to move on, so she set up 
this escape from Triel.</p>
<p align="LEFT">36-50 While the PCs are looking for Melomine, the lord 
mayor receives an ultimatum and must release some dangerous criminals to
 buy time. The PCs have to track them down too.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-65 If Melomine dies (the PCs fail), she returns as a ghost and haunts the PCs and her father until put to rest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-90 While the PCs are searching, some spawns of Tiamat or cultists of Malcanthet (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953757200">Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss</a></i>) grab Melomine from the ogres and leave few clues behind. The PCs have to contend with this new factor.</p>
<p align="LEFT">91-00 Melomine is actually a succubus servitor of 
Malcanthet, and an erinyes or a pleasure devil becomes allied with the 
PCs in a dubious way against the common demonic threat. The rewards from
 devils for success could be very interesting, including access to feats
 in <i>Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of Hell</i>.</p>
