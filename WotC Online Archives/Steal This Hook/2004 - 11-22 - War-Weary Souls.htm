<p align="left">The Last War littered Khorvaire with corpses, but it may
 have been even less kind to those who live on today. Those who survived
 that century of blood and darkness were left with scarred bodies and 
tainted memories. These brooding characters can generate emotional and 
dramatic adventure hooks for your campaign. Welcome to a war-weary souls
 edition of Steal This Hook!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b><img src="2004%20-%2011-22%20-%20War-Weary%20Souls_files/ebsh_sovhostsymbol_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="234" width="231">A Tale of Guilt and Honor</b></p>
<p align="left">Brother Yerrond, an aging cleric of the Sovereign Host, 
bashes the ornate stained-glass windows of his temple. He scratches 
runic symbols on his forehead. He leaves town, carrying a bar laden with
 weights across his shoulders, leaving his community wondering what 
hidden guilt had been eating away at him. The heroes are asked to track 
down Yerrond, and when they do, they find him making his way toward the 
Mournlands. Yerrond assures them that he hasn't gone mad, but he asks 
for their help in locating a particular family from Cyre. Because he 
killed the youngest son during the final years of the Last War, he seeks
 to offer his life in the name of Dol Arrah to the family as payment for
 their son's. Brother Yerrond refuses help with his heavy weight during 
the entire journey, but he appreciates the heroes' assistance with the 
perils of the trip.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Captain and the Hag</b></p>
<p align="left">Captain Farras tells no stories of being a Karrnathi 
Last War veteran; he was an officer whose red scale armor held 
decorations from many victories. He fought alongside and <i>among</i> 
legions of elite undead, and he became more comfortable with these 
vicious, living-hating abominations than with live soldiers. Now that 
the War has ended, drowning in emptiness and purposelessness, he's still
 obsessed with those undead creatures. One night, as he roams a 
graveyard gripping a shred of war-banner, a hunched and twisted figure 
who perceives his plight approaches him. She offers to teach him the 
discipline of necromancy, and he accepts. What might become of this foul
 pact? Will he succeed in leading a troop of howling undead in his red 
scale armor once more? What is the nature of the hunched hag mentor? 
What happens when Captain Farras' rampage kills someone he cares about 
-- will he want to raise her from the dead as well?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Jury Duty</b></p>
<p align="left">Mrs. Bebblebaum lost her three children in the War over 
five years ago -- but she doesn't know it. One year ago, the nearsighted
 and slightly senile old lady opened the door to Gim, a brave changeling
 who served shoulder-to-shoulder with her three children. Gim began to 
tell her the tragic news -- but somehow the pathetic look of Mrs. 
Bebblebaum made him shift into the persona of her eldest son instead. 
She embraced him and welcomed him in.</p>
<p align="left">Through a heroic effort of shapeshifting skill, Gim 
impersonated her three children for a year. However, Mrs. Bebblebaum's 
brother recently found out, and now Gim is on trial for fraud and 
supernatural impersonation. According to local law, he must be judged by
 a "jury of impartials," which usually means travelers not native to the
 area -- and the PCs are chosen to be that jury.</p>
<p align="left">Mrs. Bebblebaum is heartbroken about her children, but 
not angry about the deception -- her brother is the complaining party. 
The heroes must hear the facts of the case from both sides, interpret 
the laws of the region, and decide whether Gim is guilty. The decision 
may come down to what the PCs feel about the heart-rending testimonies 
of Mrs. Bebblebaum, the brother, Gim's commanding officer, and Gim 
himself.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Warforged-Forged</b></p>
<p align="left">A warforged veteran takes up a kind of sculptural 
armorsmithing and forges dozens of suits of platemail "self-portraits" 
in an attempt to express and understand his new destiny in a peacetime 
world. A barely sane worshiper of the Fury named Iruvia takes advantage 
of the sculptor's industriousness by casting <i>animate objects</i> on 
the suits of armor, filling the warforged's empty manikins with a dark 
purpose. After Iruvia's temporary army makes a pit stop at the 
weaponsmith's shop, they terrorize the town. Does Iruvia seek a way to 
make the armor her permanent entourage? Will the sight of all those 
copies of himself attacking his home village drive the sculptor mad? Was
 that Iruvia's plan all along?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Taint of the Past</b></p>
<p align="left">Kennrun, the site of several major battles on the 
eastern edge of Breland, is now a grief-stricken human settlement beset 
with awful memories of the Last War. Strangely, however, memories about 
the war have been spotty recently. A Sharn-native biographer in Kennrun 
contacts the heroes when she discovers that the townsfolk have forgotten
 the War completely. Investigation reveals that strange machinery is 
running below Fort Kennrun -- an eldritch machine that can steal 
memories -- and that preparations are being made to expand its power to 
affect entire countries of Khorvaire. Who built the device, and for what
 purpose? Has someone else discovered its power, and has that person 
decided he or she can use it for a good motive? What are the 
consequences of those memories being evaporated in Kennrun, or 
elsewhere?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Mini-Hooks</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A minotaur mercenary seeks to recover the bejeweled horn stolen from him in the War.</li>
<li>House Jorasco healers need an escort on their journey to locate a group of soldiers lost during a decade-old battle.</li>
<li>During a national veteran's holiday in Zilargo, a demonstrator becomes violent and takes a hostage.</li>
<li>Pieces of an ancient hobgoblin scroll reveal forgotten ruins buried under the property of a cranky dwarven general.</li>
<li>King Boranel's daughter Borina seeks war stories from Karrnathi 
veterans, but she discovers evidence of war crimes. She hires the heroes
 to help uncover a conspiracy.</li>
<li>A legion of not-yet-conscious warforged is discovered in a secret lab.</li>
<li>A shifter father seeks the body of his son, who was presumed to have been killed in action in Aundair.</li>
<li>Professors at Morgrave University need magical expertise in raising 
an airship that crashed and sunk to the bottom of Lake Galifar during 
the War; it may be full of historical treasures.</li>
<li>Two changeling brothers swear revenge on their abusive commanding 
officer -- and eventually the entire Brelish military -- who sent them 
into unnecessary danger during the War.</li>
