<p align="LEFT">You step on a branch and the cracking sound, though not 
very loud, alerts a fierce creature ahead of you, spoiling your chance 
to ambush it. A majestic and powerful monster denies you passage through
 the hills unless you parlay with it, or bribe it. As you walk through 
the woods, you come across a pile of bodies, and, while you investigate,
 creatures spring forth to add your remains to their collection. The 
wilderness is a natural home for monsters (thankfully), and it can be 
very dangerous to get from point A to point B in a fantasy world. This 
month's collection of hooks takes you deep into the wilderness to 
confront powerful (or numerous) monsters.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>You Will Not Pass -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2004-10%20-%20Monsters%20in%20the%20Wilderness_files/dx0410sh_stealhook_sphinx.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="202" width="240"></b>For
 many years in both Impiltur and the Vast, there have been rumors of a 
hidden pass through the Earthspur Mountains. Many think that this pass 
connects the River Vesper in the Vast with the city of Laviguer in 
Impiltur. Merchant lords would pay dearly for the knowledge of such a 
pass.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In Tantras, the adventurers meet a bard named Furellis 
Creed who tells stories of traveling this hidden pass. He is scorned by 
most, but one who hears the bard's tale is very interested. A merchant 
lord named Fennelac Brightmore spends much time talking to this bard, 
and then he hires the adventurers to travel the path that he has worked 
out from the bard's meandering tales. He believes that the pass is real.
 With sole control of it, he could monopolize trade along that path and 
become very rich.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The pass is real. The reason that it has escaped 
detection all these years is that it is the home of a lonely and 
heartbroken criosphinx. Long ago, this sphinx found and wooed a 
gynosphinx, but she spurned him in favor of an androsphinx. The sphinx 
became despondent and fled to the lonely mountain area. Since coming, he
 has chosen an unusual path (for a criosphinx) and learned arcane power 
from the texts of those he has killed. The criosphinx challenges all 
those who pass, and so far no one has met his test or bested the 
creature. The sphinx uses its magic to make those it defeats forget the 
encounter or the location of the pass.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This adventure can go into any campaign world. Here are some suggestions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> Set it in the Earthspur Mountains, as written.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> This adventure can be set in the 
mountains between Zilargo and Darguun. You might replace the criosphinx 
with an evil hieracosphinx.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic:</b> Place the adventure somewhere with a seldom-used or unused high mountain pass.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern:</b> Finding a sphinx in the modern day 
may be quite a surprising challenge for the PCs, but you could place 
this adventure in the mountain range in Algeria that is near Niger, and 
alter the backstory to give another reason why someone would want to 
find the pass.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 Fennelac Brightmore is being aboveboard with the 
adventurers. He really wants to know if the pass exists so he can map 
and control it, and he is willing to cut the adventurers in on the 
action if they can secure the pass for him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-80 Fennelac works for the criosphinx and sends people into the mountains whenever the criosphinx wants him to do so.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Fennelac knows about the criosphinx, and he needs 
the adventurers to kill it to break a family curse. He cannot ask them 
directly, however; he must trick them into doing the deed or the curse 
cannot be broken.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-30 The criosphinx has cowed a number of ice trolls, 
frost giants, or ettins into serving him. They are the reason that no 
one has ever mapped this pass; they kill any who try to enter the pass 
and cook the bodies for the criosphinx.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-50 The gynosphinx that spurned the criosphinx is in 
the area too. After years of bad treatment at the hands of the 
androsphinx, she has come to realize her mistake and is now seeking her 
former suitor. However, he has become very bitter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-80 Fennelac insists on sending along the bard 
Furellis Creed, who is a nuisance and insists on teaching the sphinx the
 proper way to challenge travelers with riddles.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 The sphinx is really a dracolich in disguise.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Ant Food -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>

 northern Breland, a halfling caravan stops in Hatheril to replenish 
supplies for its journey north into Thrane. The people of the caravan 
are relocating to join relatives in Thrane, and their caravan wagons 
contain all their earthly possessions. They set off without incident. 
Several days later, three halflings stagger into Hatheril tired and 
looking for help. They tell the adventurers that their caravan is 
waiting for them to bring help to fight the ant monsters that have been 
picking off the halflings and their horses.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The caravan was traveling through southern Thrane, near 
the Harrowcrowns, when two large insects with six legs and chitinous 
hides erupted from the ground, snatched two halflings, and disappeared 
back into the earth. The same thing happened a couple miles farther 
north. This time, a horse and a halfling were taken. The caravan stopped
 to take a defensive position, and these three were sent back to find 
help.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The creatures attacking the caravan are ankhegs that 
have moved into the plains area around the Harrowcrowns. There are well 
over one hundred of the creatures spread around, all hunting whatever 
comes by. The halfling caravan will not attempt to move from the area 
until they have competent help in the form of adventurers who can fight 
the ankhegs and protect the halflings.</p>

<p align="LEFT">01-50 Yep. There are ankhegs out there eating halflings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-80 One of the halflings is trying to kill off his 
relatives, and he knew about the ankheg infestation in advance. He 
persuaded the others to use the route through the monsters, and he 
always rides on a wagon or drives one to avoid being attacked.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 There are ankhegs, but they have not attacked the 
halflings. Another group of halflings ambused the caravan and killed 
everyone. The three coming into town are trying to lure rich adventurers
 out to the remote wilderness to be killed by the evil halflings (who 
are using the caravan). The real ankhegs are a little farther north, but
 they could appear before the adventurers deal with the halflings.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-40 The ankhegs are exhibiting unusual coordination of
 effort. A spider demon or a xill that is trying to depopulate part of 
the countryside leads them. The halfling caravan is just one victim of 
many.</p>
<p align="LEFT">41-75 Another larger monster is in the area hunting 
ankhegs, and it won't discriminate when it comes to adventurer, 
halfling, or even ankheg for dinner.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 The ankhegs are actually trained creatures in a 
special test unit of the Thrane army out on maneuvers, and Thrane won't 
be happy that they are being butchered.</p>

 wealth there, if only the monsters would go away," mused Lord DeMokka 
of Damara. "I want you to go into Vaasa and clear this tract of land for
 me," he tells you. The area he is pointing to is along the Galena 
Mountains on the Vaasa side, north of Bloodstone Pass. The land is about
 twenty miles wide and thirty miles long. "Once you rid this area of 
goblinkind and other monsters, I'll bring in people to mine and build a 
fort and settlement, and this cold land will finally begin to know 
civilization. It's a grand undertaking, and only one such as I could 
pull it off. With your help, of course. Does this interest you?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">The land of Vaasa has always been a cold and desolate 
place, and recently it was the home base of Zhengyi the Witch-King and 
his horde of monsters. Zhengyi was defeated a few years ago, but many of
 the monsters remain. The powerful people of Damara have always eyed the
 resources and lands of neighboring Vaasa, but they have been unable to 
create a permanent presence. Lord DeMokka hopes to be the first to do 
so.</p>

would have alien planets with frontiers (or whole planets that are 
frontiers). Your selection of monsters would be different than the 
cold-based ones suggested in the description.</p>

<p align="LEFT">DeMokka has the blessing of King Dragonbane in his 
efforts, and the promise of workers and troops should he prove 
successful. To do so, he must clear the tract of land of humanoid 
raiders, white dragons, remorhazes, and other frostfell monsters. This 
is a chance for the adventurers to go hunt some monsters and collect 
enough loot to become quite rich in their own rights -- if they survive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-50 Lord DeMokka wants the land cleared. He is not hiding anything.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-80 DeMokka knows of an old white dragon in the Galena
 Mountains that has a specific artifact in its horde, and he wants the 
artifact in addition to wanting the land cleared. He hires a band of 
humanoid raiders to follow the adventurers and steal that one artifact 
from them if they claim it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Lord DeMokka has a black heart and sees himself as
 the next Witch-King of Vaasa. He has an army of monstrous creatures in 
wait, and once the adventurers clear the area, he has indicated he will 
move against them, destroy them, fortify the area, and use it as his 
capitol to unify the rest of Vaasa.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-55 There are a lot of possible monster complications,
 since just about anything that makes its home in the frozen north, the 
mountains, or the arctic plains could be living in the area. All the 
creatures are wary of the great snow worms, though. Snow worms are 
bigger versions of purple worms that have adapted to the cold.</p>
<p align="LEFT">56-80 The area that Lord DeMokka is claiming is already 
claimed by a frost giant jarl who would like to open trade relations 
with Damara.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 A lot of the monsters in the area come from a <i>portal</i> created by Zhengyi the Witch-King. The adventurers have to close the <i>portal</i> in addition to cleaning out the existing monsters. </p>
