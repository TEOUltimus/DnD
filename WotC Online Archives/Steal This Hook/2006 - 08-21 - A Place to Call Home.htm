<p align="LEFT">Some creatures, like most people, need a place to call 
home, a place safe from the predations of adventurers. But sometimes, 
home is not so stable after all. Natural disasters and monster 
incursions can make home a place to defend rather than a place where one
 is protected.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Flowing Fire -- </b><i>Eberron</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-21%20-%20A%20Place%20to%20Call%20Home_files/dx0821sh_stealhook_home1.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="208" width="300">In
 the Mror Holds, the dwarven clans build mountain strongholds and 
underground cities around their mines. The dwarves are divided into 
clans, and each clan claims an area of the Holds as its own. Within a 
dwarven city or fortress, life falls very much along a dwarven mold, 
even though there are non-dwarves living in the lands too.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The southern part of the Ironroot Mountains is alive 
with volcanic activity, though the only active volcano is the Fist of 
Onatar. This area is controlled by Clan Soldorak, a wealthy but greedy 
and power-hungry clan. All dwarves view the Fist as a sacred place and a
 great source of magical power, and Soldarak is fortunate to have some 
control over it. (While the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i> says that Clan Mroranon controls it, the <i>Eberron Player's Guide</i> places it in the hold of Clan Soldarak.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Part of the defense of this area is a network of 
fortresses and dwarven mining cities that surround it and control access
 to the mountain peak itself. In one of these cities, Vonmalk, on the 
northern side of the Fist and partially underground, the dwarves go 
about their business of mining... until the day someone reports red 
magma seeping out from around the foundation of one of the taverns. 
Patrons fled the tavern as its floor was slowly covered in flowing 
magma. The dwarves soon found the crack in the earth through which the 
magma came and filled it with rock, but magma has now begun to flow 
through other parts of the city. So far, the dwarves have kept ahead of 
the incidents, but eventually they'll be unable to stop the destruction 
of their city.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though the magma is behaving "naturally," and such 
losses are not unheard-of near the Fist of Onatar, there is one who 
thinks (or perhaps hopes desperately) that there is some evil force 
behind the destruction. The lord of Vonmalk, Morrid Soldarak, sees a 
pattern in the apparently chaotic destruction, and seeks out adventurers
 to brave the depths and find out if he is right. In exchange for help, 
he is willing to offer gold, or--better yet--access to dwarven smiths 
for the production of rare arms and armors.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for different campaign worlds. You'll want to use <i>Races of Stone</i> for the dwarven aspects and the mountain dangers. <i>Underdark</i> could be useful for the adventure setting itself, and <i>Fiendish Codex I</i> could help with any demons you introduce. The <i>Player's Guide to Eberron</i> gives good information about the Mror Holds, but you'll also need the <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms</b>: The most likely place for this 
adventure is in the Silver Marches or Sword Coast North areas, in the 
mountains near the Spine of the World. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic</b>: The basic requirement for this adventure
 is a range of volcanic mountains with connections to the Underdark in 
your campaign world. Ideally, the dwarven city would be somewhat 
isolated, but connected enough to a dwarven nation of some kind that the
 danger could be communicated and help could arrive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d20 Modern</b>: This adventure could be interesting 
in Hawaii or anywhere in the Pacific Ring of Fire, as long as you dump 
the mining aspect and create some other commodity that the dwarves are 
controlling. The events of this adventure could presage the eruption of a
 large volcano like Mt. Saint Helens or even Mt. Rainier and the 
destruction of Seattle.</p>

<p align="LEFT"> 01-40 Lord Morrid Soldarak is aboveboard with the 
adventurers, because he genuinely believes others may be convinced as 
well about an evil force.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 41-65 Morrid Soldarak is allied with the creatures who 
are causing the destruction. He has been promised great personal and 
magical power in exchange for sacrificing his whole city to one of the 
dark demonic powers behind a Cult of the Dragon Below. The adventurers 
are a bonus sacrifice to ensure his immortality (the cult has stipulated
 "outside heroes" as part of its bargain).</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 66-00 Many in the city see the fall of Vonmalk as 
imminent. They oppose the wasting of time involved with waiting for 
adventurers to return (or not). These people interfere with the 
adventurers' efforts and with Lord Morrid Soldarak, and urge immediate 
abandonment of the city before any lives are lost. As an option, one or 
more of these people could secretly be allied with the Cult of the 
Dragon Below. This person's motivation is to drive off the dwarves so 
that the Cult can claim the wealth of the nearby mines.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-55 The lava is being directed by salamanders and 
fire elementals toward Vonmalk. They are being controlled by a fiery 
demon of great power trapped in Khyber. Vonmalk is directly above its 
prison, and the destruction of the city would open a way for the demon 
to be freed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 56-65 A powerful efreeti noble wants to use the city to
 bury access to the prison of a demon that the efreeti imprisoned back 
in the Age of Demons. The efreeti is directing fire elementals, magma 
elementals, and even redspawn firebelchers (see <i>Monster Manual IV</i>) to divert the flow of lava toward the city.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 66-90 The lava is not the only danger facing the brave 
heroes. The lava is coming from Khyber, and a lot of things live down 
there. The adventurers face dangers from purple worms to ropers to deep 
dragons--some of which may be fleeing up into the city away form the 
lava.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 91-00 Drow living beneath the dwarves want to destroy 
the city and take control of the mine, in order to enhance their own 
power within the drow world. They are using powerful creation magic and 
bound elementals to wreak their chaos.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Cursed Vale -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2008-21%20-%20A%20Place%20to%20Call%20Home_files/dx0821sh_stealhook_home2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="321" width="250">Stories
 abound regarding the Vale of Mysar, otherwise known in Asbravn as the 
Cursed Valley. The Vale of Mysar, named for the first person to find it,
 is a hidden valley several miles long in the Far Hills. The valley is 
fertile and temperate, and supports lush grasses, trees, and a variety 
of animals (and even a few things classified as monsters). It is ideal 
farmland, with many farmers relocating to the valley when it was 
discovered during the time of Netheril. Yet none of them lived to tell 
the tale. Soon after they arrived, a great storm came over the valley 
and killed almost everyone. The few that escaped on foot described 
creatures of lightning coming down from the sky and ghostly riders on 
ghostly dinosaurs trampling anything that moved during the terrible 
storm.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There is still great interest in settling the valley, 
and over the centuries since, farmers have tried to reclaim it. However,
 something always either drives them out or outright kills them. Some go
 mad from whispered voices, some reach Asbravn speaking of lightning 
creatures and ghosts, and some don't return at all. No one has ever 
found a body in the valley, so the fate of any would-be settler is as 
much a mystery as why the Vale of Mysar refuses to be settled. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Brista Mylane, a resident of Berdusk, seeks out brave 
heroes because her foolish brother, Bevlis Mylane, decided to attempt 
the Vale of Mysar against the wishes of his family. He thought he could 
break the curse, but he has not returned either. Given the Cursed 
Valley's reputation, Brista is worried and wants someone to go find her 
brother. She doesn't have much to offer, but suggests that the monsters 
of the valley could be quite "valuable" if some were captured or 
harvested and sold in Asbravn.</p>

 To make the magic of the curse (if there is one) different from what 
the adventurers normally deal with, and thus make the adventure even 
more interesting, you might use <i>Magic of Incarnum</i> or <i>Tome of Magic</i>, both of which introduce brand new magic systems.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron</b>: Given the possible existence of 
dinosaurs, this adventure could be set in the Talenta Plains, or the 
southern Ironroot Mountains on the Talenta Plains side, or even the 
Endworld Mountains near the Blade Desert.</p>

doesn't have to be hidden, you can set this adventure almost anywhere 
near enough to civilization that people would want to settle it. </p>

<p align="LEFT"> 01-50 Brista is honest about her desires to find her 
brother... but her cousins don't want the brother found because they 
would then gain his inheritance. They work to stop the heroes from 
finding Bevlis and restoring him to life.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 51-85 There are rumors of gold and lost treasure in the
 Vale of Mysar, which is what Brista is really interested in. That's 
also what her brother was interested in, but he never even made it to 
the valley--he was killed by a Zhent raiding party.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 86-00 Brista insists on accompanying the adventurers. 
She enspelled her brother to go to the Vale and grow some ingredients 
for a potion she is making; the ingredients must be harvested in a 
cursed location. She doesn't plan for the adventurers to leave the Vale 
alive.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> 01-45 The Vale of Mysar is the subject of an ancient 
curse from the days before Netheril. The Vale was discovered even 
earlier, but the first settlers squabbled and fought constantly. 
Finally, violence erupted and several of them were killed. One of these,
 a retired priest, spat out a curse that has held to this day, powered 
by the magic of some ancient deity. Until the curse is broken, no one 
can settle the valley.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 46-55 The curse on the valley called forth the dead 
that had been buried from even more ancient times. These dead rise as 
ghosts and specters to drive out any living creatures in the Vale, or to
 drive them mad. These apparitions ride ghostly dinosaurs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 56-70 The curse on the valley is nothing more than 
horrible weather that strikes the valley daily. People who saw 
electrical elementals imagined them in the danger from the real weather.
 The ghosts were merely figments of the imagination. However, there is a
 lich that lives in a tomb at the far end of the valley that uses the 
weather and its magic to keep everyone out of the valley.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> 71-00 The Vale is home to a lost tribe of reclusive 
saurials (or other rare humanoid race such as catfolk) that ride 
dinosaurs and has remained undetected so far. They created the idea of 
the curse to be left alone.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alternate Rewards</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Gold is not the only reason to adventure. Here are some ideas for alternative rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the heroes discover the root of the curse and be able to lift
 it, they could claim (or be rewarded with) a large tract of fertile 
land in this valley to use for a fortress or other kind of base.</li>
<li>Ghostly dinosaurs don't lay eggs, but real ones do. Should there be 
real dinosaurs in the valley, the adventurers could collect eggs and 
raise their own dinosaur mounts.</li>
<li>The air, grass or dirt from a cursed valley could be a spell 
component for some new spell that one of the adventurers is researching,
 or to a rare spell that they find in another adventure.</li>

 the south of Faerun, further than even the Shaar, lies the nation of 
Dambrath. A little north and west of there is a tract of ground called 
the Swagdar, which lies between Dambrath, Halruaa, and Lapaliiya. This 
rugged place is ringed by forests and mountains that are home to 
different kinds of trolls, among other dangerous monsters. Travelers 
pass through this area frequently, and brave both bandits from the 
Forest of Amtar and trolls (as well as manticores and dragons) from the 
North Wall, the Wyrmbones, and the Channathwood.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adventurers traveling through this area on their way to 
Dambrath, Luiren, or wherever, will see a somewhat large group of trolls
 rushing toward them from the forest west of Rethmar. The trolls rush 
past them without even stopping to attack, seeming too worried or 
fearful. Later, a few mountain trolls pass in a great hurry, also going 
in the direction of the Forest of Amtar. Other people they pass on the 
road share similar stories, of trolls and other monsters moving eastward
 toward the Forest of Amtar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In Rethmar (or Channathgate), the adventurers will then 
hear of an apparent attack on the town. Some mountain trolls and cave 
trolls rushed the walls and battered at them for a bit, but then turned 
and fled eastward. No one was killed, including none of the trolls. 
Nonetheless, a group of merchants that make Rethmar their base are 
worried, and would like to find some stalwart souls to go westward and 
find out what is scaring the creatures out of the mountains and forests.
 They are willing to offer great wealth to those brave heroes that can 
prevent an even bigger disaster from befalling their town (and 
businesses). One of them, rather than offering wealth, offers an old map
 that his family acquired in a card game a few years ago. He has not had
 the time or the inclination to follow it.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Races of Stone</i> or <i>Races of the Wild</i> could be very useful for fleshing out the forest and mountain sections, and you'll want <i>Monster Manual III</i> for the different kinds of trolls.

<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron</b>: Mountain trolls live primarily in the 
mountains around the Eldeen Reaches, so if you want to include them in

better, though it would be more reasonable to find the adventurers in 
Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches near Greenheart.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic</b>: Basically, some mountains and forests 
together are the minimum requirements, with scattered frontier towns 
that can be threatened by huge trolls. Set this in an area of your

<p align="LEFT"> 91-00 This matter has come to the attention of Those 
Who Harp, and they are concerned that a powerful demon is loose in the

 the Harper agent manipulates them into investigating anyway by 
mentioning the innocents that are in danger.</p>

<p align="LEFT"> 01-50 A death giant has migrated from Anauroch into the
 mountains in this region, and has been killing off the trolls. The

despite their healing capabilities, and because of its ability to steal 
souls.</p>

exact revenge on the wizard and return to the Abyss.</p>
