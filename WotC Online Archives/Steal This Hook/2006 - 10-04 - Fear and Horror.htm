<p> Horrific things can happen at any time, and they don't just have to 
be the gory events of slasher movies. In fact, the more horrific events 
play on the mind's fears instead of the body's. So this month we present
 a trio of strange events that can turn into wonderfully horrific 
scenarios with a little imagination on your part.</p>
<p> This month's hooks include suggestions for using them in a <b>Ravenloft</b> campaign, since Wizards of the Coast has its <b>Ravenloft</b>
 supplement coming out this month. If you love the Land of Dread as much
 as I do, then take a hook or two and have fun scaring your players.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>"And the Frogs Came, and Covered the Land . . ."</b> -- <i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p> Laviguer, a farming and mining center in Impiltur and the only major
 city not on the coast, is a place where life can be normal one moment 
and strange the next. The nearby Earthspur Mountains provide bloodstone 
and gold . . . as well as monsters and other strangeness from time to 
time. For the most part, though, life moves at a steady pace without 
much interruption. Miners mine, merchants sell, people walk the streets 
from here to there... *splat!* "Ribbit." And sometimes a frog falls from
 the sky. "Ribbit."<img src="2006%20-%2010-04%20-%20Fear%20and%20Horror_files/sh20061004a_frog.jpg" align="right" border="0"></p>
<p> Without warning, one frog turns into a rain of them, each one 
landing with a splat and yet surviving unharmed. People run scared and 
lock themselves inside, but the frogs become so numerous that they begin
 to find ways in. After a while, the cacophony of ribbiting begins to 
drive people a little crazy, not to mention the collateral damage of the
 rain of frogs. Before the day is out, frogs fall on the city for over 5
 hours, thousands upon thousands of them. When it is all over, the city 
is knee-deep in the wriggling creatures, which have nowhere to go and no
 environment hospitable for them.</p>
<p> The PCs, in town to try the mountain trek to the Vast (or for some 
other reason), can find any number of people who would hire them to 
figure out where the frogs came from and whether they portend any danger
 to Laviguer -- for instance, merchants such as Grisallne the Gifted 
(human female expert 10/sorcerer 4, Cha 18). Grisallne is already 
thinking of ways to make money from this event, and so would like the 
information for different reasons. On the other end of things, a druid 
named Kotalla is concerned that this marks the beginning of a strange 
attack on the city, and she wants the PCs to find the source of the 
frogs and stop whoever is behind it. Kotalla can tell the PCs (assuming 
they did not already know with a DC 20 Knowledge [nature] check) that 
the frogs are all the same, and are all indigenous to a remote valley in
 the Earthfast Mountains some sixty or more miles away. Lastly, there is
 a little girl named Crytalle that would like the frogs all returned to 
their point of origin, because she is very concerned about their 
well-being. She is also wealthy enough to pay for their transport (well,
 her parents are) should the heroes arrange the logistics.</p>
<p><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p> 01-50 Whoever hires the PCs is sincere in what he or she says.</p>
<p> 51-80 The townsfolk, a superstitious lot, know that some evil magic 
was behind the attack of frogs, and they want vengeance on the person 
responsible.</p>
<p> 81-00 Someone in town wanted the frogs to rain, possibly to disrupt 
the trade efforts of a rival, or to create an atmosphere of mistrust and
 fear.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p> A rain of frogs can happen just about anywhere with a little help. Think about inflicting it on these campaign worlds.</p>
<p><b>Eberron:</b> Set this adventure in Dragonroost, in Zilargo. The 
frogs can come from a valley in the Seawall Mountains. You might even 
get the goblin nation of Darguun involved as villains.</p>
<p><b>Ravenloft:</b> Stage a rain of frogs in Viktal or Kellee, in 
Tepest. The people there are beset by horrors from the woods on a 
regular basis, but a rain of frogs should really make them troubled.</p>
<p><b>Generic:</b> Anywhere will do. The valley that is home to the frogs doesn't even have to be close.</p>
<p><b>d20 Modern:</b> A lot of frogs naturally brings to mind Egypt and 
Biblical plagues. Some alien power based in the Sudan could be modeling 
their terror attacks on ancient world curses.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p> 01-30 The rain of frogs was caused by Dapex (male elf 
druid/wizard/arcane hierophant) who found the frogs annoying and used 
magic to expel every last one of them from the valley that he claimed as
 his own. However, because they were part of the food chain, Dapex will 
have other problems soon enough.</p>
<p> 31-50 In the wake of the frogs, another vastly more dangerous 
creature comes calling. A red dragon that lairs in the Earthfast 
Mountains saw the stream of frogs and followed it east as it went. Now 
that it has found Laviguer, it wants treasure.</p>
<p> 51-70 A cult of the demon lord Obox-ob has established itself in the
 valley, and it is using the valley to grow some new vermin for 
attacking mountain communities. The rare frogs of the valley are natural
 predators of the new vermin, and in typical demon fashion the cultists 
removed the frogs rather than find a different valley. The vermin will 
be let loose on Laviguer as a first test if their creators are not 
stopped. (In this case, feel free to make the vermin appear as something
 particularly creepy to your characters.)</p>
<p> 71-90 Among the frogs, some slaadi begin terrorizing the populace as
 soon as they land, throwing other frogs around in addition to their 
normal attack modes.</p>
<p> 91-00 Way more frogs fell on Laviguer than lived in the valley. 
Where did the rest come from? Was this some kind of demonic attack? Does
 the trouble extend to another world, or another plane?</p>

 Athandra, sitting near the center of Thrane, is home to the adventuring
 group called the Six Aeylisors (they are not related, but the original 
group was). The Six hunt treasure across Khorvaire and even on Xen'drik.
 Lately, they returned from the Demon Wastes with a huge treasure of 
gold, figurines, jewels, and a few magic items (which they kept). The 
rest they sold to traders. The night after the sale was completed, the 
first body was found.</p>
<p> No one knows who killed Mishrie, daughter of a tavern owner, but her
 manner of death is clear: She was stabbed repeatedly. The next few 
bodies were killed in different ways: decapitation, drowning in a well, 
being buried alive, and so forth. Either the murderer liked to vary his 
or her technique, or there are a number of murderers. No one realizes 
that there might be a connection to the treasure brought back by the 
Six, because the Six left town on another adventure before the third 
body was found.</p>
<p> The constabulary of Athandra begins to get desperate after the 
eleventh victim is found with no suspects. They send to Sigilstar for 
some magical help in finding the killer(s), and the authorities there 
send the PCs.</p>

<p><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p> If you're not running an Eberron campaign, you can still adapt this idea. You might find concepts in <i>Ghostwalk</i> useful, though the setting itself won't be. <i>Libris Mortis</i> could also be valuable.</p>
<p><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> This is a good adventure for anywhere in the
 Realms really, but you might especially try one of the cities of Sembia
 or the Dragon Coast.</p>
<p><b>Ravenloft:</b> This adventure is well suited to the stark urban 
poverty of Nova Vaasa, though it could work well in Port-a-Lucine in 
Dementlieu.</p>
<p><b>Generic: </b>The city in which this adventure takes place needs to
 be large enough that the murders don't dominate the news, and small 
enough that they are important (and that there are not magical dwellers 
who would just wave their hands and solve the problem).</p>
<p><b>d20 Modern: </b>Though this could happen anywhere, especially in a
 Lovecraftian New England, you might consider Brazil for this adventure 
instead; the South American elements could make the story very 
interesting if your PCs don't already come from South America.</p>

<p><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p> 01-25 The killings are being caused by a curse on the treasure's 
figurines. Once the figurines are removed from their place of safety, 
they begin infecting random people with a magical mental disease that 
turns them into vicious killers. As the figurines move around, so does 
the curse spread.</p>
<p> 26-50 The killings are caused by a ghost that inhabits part of the 
treasure. The ghost is that of an ancient murderer who now can continue 
his "craft" only by possessing others and using them to kill.</p>
<p> 51-75 The killings are the result of recent lycanthrope activity in 
the region. The lycanthropes seek revenge on the Six for some slain pack
 members, so they want to slay anyone known to the Six (which pretty 
much means the whole town). They use different methods to disguise their
 true nature.</p>
<p> 76-00 The head law officer in Athandra is possessed by a demon and 
is behind all the attacks, whether he knows it or not. The demon may or 
may not be related to the treasure brought back by the Six Aeylisors.</p>
<p><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p> 01-25 All of the murder victims return as ghosts themselves, looking
 for final rest. However, along the way they are also looking for 
vengeance against their killer, and they are not very discriminate upon 
whom they take vengeance.</p>
<p> 26-65 The Six Aeylisors are carrying the curse with them, and they 
are on their way to much more populated cities such as Flamekeep.</p>
<p> 66-85 A group of thieves is using the situation, and the fact that 
the constabulary is distracted by the murders, to their advantage and 
have started a crime spree. Some of their crimes could include murder, 
which would further confuse the investigation.</p>
<p> 86-00 The curse prevents contact with the dead victims, so <i>speak with dead,</i><i>raise dead, </i>and the like<i></i>are useless as investigative tools.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>"I Fade Away Like an Evening Shadow"</b> -- <i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2010-04%20-%20Fear%20and%20Horror_files/sh20061004a_library.jpg" align="right" border="0"></p>
<p> Cimbar, the nominal capitol of Chessenta, is a city known for the 
arts and culture as well as for strength of sword-arm. Indeed, the 
populace is required to participate in the arts, philosophy, and music. 
It is also known for its colleges of sages, artists, and wizards. The 
college of sages is always seeking to expand its collection of old (and 
new) tomes, and recently that has brought on a problem.</p>
<p> Adventurers unearthed a collection of old tomes from the days of 
Netheril, and they sold them at a hefty profit to the college of sages. 
The sages, seeing a need for a new "collection" area, opened an old 
storage room that had not been used in hundreds of years. Within, the 
sages had a lot of junk cleared out. Among this junk were a number of 
bones of humans, rats, and dogs.</p>
<p><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p> 01-45 Kleffes is on the up-and-up about everything he says. He 
really does want the problem solved with as little fuss as possible.</p>
<p> 46-70 Kleffes is sincere in wanting to know what is going on, but he
 doesn't care about his fellow sages nearly as much as he says he does. 
There is competition among sages in the same fields, and, should a rival
 die, then Kleffes would become more prominent. Kleffes would never kill
 anyone himself, though.</p>
<p> 71-00 Kleffes doesn't care about the sages. He is actually an agent 
for a sage's college in Soorenar and sees this as a chance to make this 
college look foolish (and thus lose station). He wants all the details 
made as public as possible.</p>

<p><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p> This creepy adventure can work in many campaign worlds, including yours. <i>Libris Mortis</i> might be useful for the shadows. You could also work some shadow magic into the adventure using <i>Tome of Magic</i>.</p>
<p><b>Eberron:</b> This adventure is practically begging to be set in 
the Library of Korranberg, but you might consider Morgrave University or
 a large city in Aundair.</p>
<p><b>Ravenloft:</b> Use a bardic library in Skald, in Kartakass, as the
 setting for this adventure. The shadowy threat contrasts well with the 
general joyfulness of Kartakass.</p>
<p><b>Generic:</b> Any sage college will do, or even a college of 
wizardry or a bardic college. The sages are better because they are less
 likely to have the magical resources to solve the problem themselves.</p>
<p><b>d20 Modern:</b> There are libraries everywhere, and museums work 
just as well. How about the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian, or the
 British Museum?</p>

<p><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p> 01-40 The storeroom contained the bones of some victims of a prior 
warlord of Chessenta, and, when the bones were disturbed, the victims 
returned as shadows. Now they haunt the hallways, striking from stealth 
and trying to remain undetected as they drain the strength away from the
 sages.</p>
<p> 41-60 There is a lot of light for reading throughout the library, 
but the shadows avoid it and strike at those in book storage rooms or 
those going to or from somewhere. The shadows stay in the walls as much 
as possible.</p>
<p> 61-80 Too late! As the PCs begin their investigation, they find a 
dead sage slumped at a table near the old storeroom. He has been dead 
for a few hours, and he has become one more shadow that the PCs will 
have to fight eventually.</p>
<p> 81-90 Should the PCs somehow talk to a shadow or to the corpses that
 were removed from the room, they can learn the (false) information that
 the shadows can be put to rest if the bones are buried honorably with a
 full description of the crimes against them. If anyone does this, the 
shadows take a week off from hunting sages to lull people into thinking 
the problem has gone away.</p>
<p> 91-00 The storeroom contains a <i>portal</i> linking the room to the Plane of Shadow. Other shadow creatures can come through as well should the <i>portal</i> be opened.<br><br><br></p>
