 hits the shelves and gives you a lot of fun information about playing 
heroic championlike characters, along with a boatload of new feats and 
prestige classes. Champions always need things to do, and most of a 
champion's quests fall into one of two main categories: defeat evil and 
help innocents. We'll leave the direct hooks to evil until later, and 
focus on the innocents. This month, three different kinds of innocents 
in trouble seek champions to help them. Bring them into your campaign 
today to see what your players' heroes are made of.</p>

 in the Ride is dangerous, but the barbarian nomads can be avoided if 
one stays on the road between Ilenvur and the Citadel of the Raven. The 
PCs are on that road, for whatever reason, when someone sees a body 
lying in the cold plains north of the road. The body is that of a 
halfling bard named Chanker (for short), and he is almost dead from 
starvation, thirst, and exposure. His clothes are tattered so badly that
 they barely stay on his small body. If revived, he looks with startled 
wonder at the PCs, thanks the gods, and then begins this tale in a sad 
and low voice.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"I am the only one to escape. My friends and comrades 
are all . . . I don't know anymore. Eight of us set out for the Great 
Glacier and crossed a portion of the Tortured Lands. We chose that route
 for directness and because the Tortured Land is unpopulated. Two days 
in, we found a fortress rising from the volcanic plains. Being 
adventurers, we went to investigate, but before we had even entered we 
blacked out and awoke in cells. A tall genie with red skin told us we 
were his slaves and set us to work, but we knew he was trying to fool 
our minds somehow. It turns out that everyone succumbed but me. I 
pretended, instead, and bided my time. My companions accepted their lot.
 Finally, after months, I escaped through a drainage hole and made my 
way across the Tortured Lands, and then into the barbarian lands we now 
occupy. By the time I had come halfway across the steppes, I was 
feverish and delirious due to lack of sustenance. Finally, I could go no
 farther, and I thought I would die in these harsh lands. Praise 
Yondalla that you have found me."</p>

genie, and free his friends. He is worried that they might already be 
dead because of his own escape. He offers all their gear in payment for 
their lives -- gear now held by the genie.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">01-60 Chankar is on the up-and-up.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-75 Chankar is a demon servant of the slavemaster and 
was put here specifically to lure the PCs to the fortress because they 
are carrying something the slavemaster wants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-85 Chankar is making up the whole tale because he is 
afraid the PCs will kill him. He plans to lead them north a few days and
 then disappear on them. There really is a fortress, even though 
Chankar's companions are not there (since he didn't have any).</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 Chankar is a friend or relative of one of the PCs,
 and he tells them the truth even though he was supposed to lie to them 
to lure them to the fortress for reasons of greed. He hopes the PCs can 
slay the slavemaster and free his friends, who serve as insurance that 
Chankar behaves when away from the fortress.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-25 The slavemaster isn't a genie; it's a demon that a
 wizard trapped on this plane. The demon slew the wizard and then moved 
the wizard's fortress to the Tortured Land to be out of the public eye 
while it gained strength and power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">26-45 The other adventurers have become willing slaves 
of the genie (or demon), and they don't want to be freed. They won't 
report the PCs' presence, but they resist being carried away from the 
fortress. This could be the result of charm magic or simply their own 
choice to be enslaved.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-70 The Tortured Land is home to more than just this 
fortress. Its cold, sculpted plains are home to a few monsters that have
 wandered down from the Great Glacier, including ice worms and 
remorhazes. </p>
<p align="LEFT">71-00 The fortress is gone when the PCs reach the site. 
The slavemaster moved the whole thing a few miles farther into the 
Tortured Land because the halfling escaped, and the PCs have to decide 
if they believe the fortress existed and then figure out where it is. 
The slavemaster erased signs of its existence, which means the PCs have 
some intense searching to do to discover them.</p>

 is a dangerous place for anyone not of a monstrous race or of monstrous
 descent. The land is crawling with ogres, medusas, gnolls, hags and 
whatever else, and the humanoids that make up the populations of other 
nations are viewed with some distrust. The weight of the law, such as it
 is, falls more heavily upon humanoids there, just as it falls more 
heavily on the monsters in other lands.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Great Crag is the capitol of this land, and it 
serves as the home of the hags called the Daughters of Sora Kell. Trolls
 and ogres keep the laws that these hags hand down, usually with a lot 
of force and an excess of enjoyment. Prisoners are sometimes sent to the
 gladiatorial arena for a one-time chance to win their freedom. Usually 
they don't, because the gladiators are fierce and well trained. When the
 hags are feeling unusually cruel, a victim might be offered several 
chances to win his (or her) freedom, suffering successive resurrections 
to fight over and over again. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs, visiting the Great Crag for some reason, are 
walking down the street when they see a thin and scrawny half-elf on a 
corner trying to talk to passers-by. Most ignore him, since he is 
chained between two trolls who look intimidating. "Please, I am 
innocent! Is there no one who will stand for me?" This half-elf has been
 accused of a great crime, and instead of a trial he has been sent to 
the arena to fight for his life. He is obviously unfit for this, so the 
magistrates have allowed him to find someone to fight in his place. The 
fighter will not suffer the punishments for the crime, except death if 
he or she cannot win in the arena. All that the probably-doomed man can 
offer is his gratitude.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-60 The half-elf, Ismorath, is innocent of the crime 
but cannot prove it. Since justice against humans and elves works a 
little backwardly here, this is his only chance to "prove his 
innocence." Basically, if he puts on a good show and wins, the 
magistrates don't care if he did it or not and will release him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-70 The half-elf was set up by someone associated with
 the gladiatorial arena, solely for the purpose of getting more people 
to fight there. The half-elf is also not the first person so set up, 
just the first allowed to find a surrogate.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-00 The half-elf knows that the trolls plan to release
 him and hold whoever agrees to fight in his place responsible for the 
crime (that's justice in Droaam), but he is cowardly and tries to 
recruit a PC anyway.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-45 The half-elf is a scapegoat, who is being punished
 so that everyone forgets the crime. Whether the PC wins or loses is 
immaterial (except perhaps to the PC). However, following up on the 
crime could lead to a more interesting adventure full of dark haggish 
intrigue.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-80 The master of the arena has been known to cheat on
 occasion, and he will make something turn out the way it's "supposed 
to." Actions might include releasing extra monsters if the PC is doing 
well, using better gladiators posing as worse ones, and slipping the PC 
faulty equipment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Within the gladiators, there are factions and alliances. The PC perhaps has to navigate a gladiatorial uprising (a la <i>Gladiator </i> ) while discharging his or her mission.</p>

 Theocracy of the Pale is in the cold northwest part of the Flanaess. 
Priests of Pholtus rule the land -- a land of great rural stretches -- 
with their unwavering philosophies. The Rakers Mountains bound the 
country on the east, and the Phostwood bounds it on the west. Within 
this land, people live simply and work hard to make good lives.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs are traveling in the eastern part of the 
country, from Rakervale south to Ogburg, when they find some giant-sized
 tracks crossing the road and heading eastward. A tracker can determine 
that they were hill giants, that there were about eight of them, and 
that they seemed to be carrying something heavy. The tracks lead east 
into the Rakers. Following them westward, the PCs arrive in a farming 
and ranching community where they learn that a number of cattle are 
missing. No one saw what happened to them, and though people have seen 
the large tracks, they don't know what the tracks belong to. This is the
 second time in a month that cattle have disappeared. The first was 
three weeks ago and the community concluded that it was a one-time 
theft. But they were wrong. The people here don't have the skills or 
courage to track the giants, and they beg the PCs in the name of Pholtus
 to help them. They have little to offer, but suggest that the giants 
must have collected some valuables.</p>
