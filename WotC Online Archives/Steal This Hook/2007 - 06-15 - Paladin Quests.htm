<p align="LEFT">With the release of <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/955647200">Complete Champion</a></i><i></i>in
 May, thoughts turn naturally to the heroic, especially the heroic 
fighter. Talk of heroic fighters usually includes paladins, those 
exemplars of goodness and law that fight for higher principles and chase
 evil across the land. This month's hooks involve paladins . . . but not
 exclusively. Any character can be a champion, so any character should 
have the chance to partake of heroic adventures. These hooks involve 
paladins that need the help of other heroic characters.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Several hundred years ago, a paladin of the Silver Flame
 named Sojer Ustel single-handedly defended the small town of Banesia, 
in northwestern Thrane, from a tribe of werewolves that lived in the 
forest northeast of Daskaran. The group of werewolves preyed on the 
smaller towns in the region because the people could not defend 
themselves very well. Eventually, Sojer Ustel came to Banesia and 
rallied the people to make a stand. In the name of the Silver Flame, he 
attacked the werewolves when they next came to Banesia and drove them 
off. That started a war between the paladin and the werewolves that 
lasted for several months -- a war that the werewolves were losing.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the end, the paladin disappeared without a trace. The
 worried people faked his presence when the werewolves next came. The 
tired werewolves, now reduced to only a few, decided that they'd had 
enough and left the area. The people rejoiced and gave the credit to 
Sojer for driving them off. They commissioned a statue of Sojer from 
descriptions of him. The statue was duly erected in the town square, but
 no trace of the man himself was ever found. He simply disappeared into 
history. He has served as an inspiration to generations of paladins ever
 since, and a legend states that he will return when needed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Recently, a sage and historian came through trying to 
piece together the life of Sojer Ustel. In the course of her 
investigations she came to the conclusion that Sojer didn't just 
disappear; he was attacked by a demon and his soul was trapped in the 
statue in the center of Banesia. This sage, named Claristel, wants help 
finding Sojer's remains and somehow restoring him from the dead.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are some suggestions for using this hook in other campaign worlds. <i>Complete Champion</i> can help flesh out the petrified paladin. The <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts </i>could help with any werewolves you need.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> This adventure could work very 
well in the Dalelands, where each Dale (and each town) is more or less 
independent. The werewolves would live in the nearby forest. Daggerdale 
and Deepingdale offer access to the mountains as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A village stalked by werewolves (or were-whatevers -- it doesn't much matter) that is somewhat isolated is all you need.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk:</b> Set this adventure in Veluna or 
Furyondy, on the northern borders with the Vesve Forest and the lands of
 Iuz. Sojer becomes a paladin of Heironeous.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern:</b> In the modern world, Europe seems a good 
locale for a werewolf-themed adventure. Specifically, set this in 
northern Scotland, or even central Scotland. Northern England could 
work, but it is rather populated nowadays. Some places in Wales and 
Germany might fit the bill too.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ravenloft:</b> This adventure could be especially 
well suited to Ravenloft, a land where evil slowly destroys anything 
good. It would have a tragic ending, of course.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-45 Claristel really is a historian, but she seeks Sojer's artifact sword rather than the paladin himself.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-85 Claristel is sincere in what she tells the PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 The descendants of the werewolves that Sojer drove
 off have returned and seek to stop the PCs from restoring their ancient
 enemy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-45 Sojer is indeed needed now, since the descendants 
of the werewolves he fought have returned to the area. Led by a nearly 
indestructible half-fiend werewolf, they cannot be stopped without 
Sojer's artifact holy sword, and that was lost when he disappeared.</p>
<p align="LEFT">46-70 A descendant of Sojer is in the town, since Sojer 
had a liaison with a local woman while there. This descendant wants 
Sojer restored as well so that the descendant can find and claim the 
holy sword.</p>
<p align="LEFT">71-85 Sojer has been driven mad during his centuries of 
imprisonment in the statue. If he is restored, he begins a streak of 
deranged evil acts. He must be stopped so that he can atone for these 
deeds (and be cured) if anyone is to find the sword.</p>
<p align="LEFT">86-00 Sojer's sword is normal. Sojer has the power 
within him (or did in his old body) to make any weapon he holds into a 
bane (shapechangers) weapon. He may or may not realize this. If he does 
not, then he seeks out his old sword when restored. But he needs his 
original body. </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Atonement -- </b><i>Greyhawk</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs are in Rakervale, in the Theocracy of the Pale, 
for whatever reason. Perhaps they are on their way to Ratik, or they 
seek adventure in the Rakers. During the afternoon they witness a female
 warrior in bent and broken full plate armor limp into the town from the
 northwest and then collapse in the street. Her name is Saita Oroda, and
 she is trying to become a paladin of Pholtus. Either when revived right
 then by the PCs, or later, she can relate this story.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Trolls go anywhere, which is cool because as classic 
monsters go, they are hard to beat. Give them barbarian or scout levels 
to make them tougher. You can also use different kinds of trolls from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179210000">Monster Manual III</a></i>. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Try the Shadow Marches. Xen'drik might 
be good too, since the captive parents could have been transported by 
ship or flying ship from Khorvaire.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Forgotten Realms:</b> You could set this adventure near the High Moor. The trolls could live in the Moor or the Misty Forest.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b>You need a place where trolls live. Sounds simple, eh?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern: </b>In the Modern world, trolls might live 
anywhere that is not too dry. These trolls could be members of a crime 
cartel in Japan or Europe. You could also stage them as brutish 
creatures living in the Everglades.</p>

<p align="LEFT">"When I was younger, I betrayed my family out of hatred,
 and I sold them into slavery to some trolls that live in the Troll 
Fens. Now that I have seen the Light of Pholtus and become a paladin, I 
must atone for my past misdeeds and undo as many of them as possible. So
 say the priests of the Blinding Light. I tracked the trolls that have 
my family, and only my younger brother has been killed in all these 
years. The rest still work for the trolls. I tried to free them, but the
 trolls are too much for me to defeat on my own. Unless Pholtus sends 
aid to me, I shall fail and never achieve the blessed state that I 
seek."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Motivations</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-60 Saita is sincere in her desire and reasons. She really wants to be a paladin of Pholtus, poor girl.</p>
<p align="LEFT">61-80 Saita is trying to steal a valuable treasure from 
the trolls, not rescue her family. She wants the treasure either as an 
offering to the priest of Pholtus or for its power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Saita is a shapechanged doppelganger or fiend 
trying to lure the PCs to their deaths at the troll camp. Perhaps she is
 a minion of a recurring villain in your campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>d100 Complications</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">00-30 The trolls work for a black dragon, and their camp is actually the dragon's lair.</p>
<p align="LEFT">31-50 There are actually very few trolls. The whole 
troll camp is on top of an entrance to the Underdark, and the trolls are
 slaves of a group of mind flayers. The trolls did buy people, who have 
been taken underground for dining or slavery.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 The trolls have a well-fortified camp, and they are planning a war against the nearby Theocracy of the Pale.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 The troll camp is deserted when the PCs arrive, 
and it looks like it has not been inhabited in a long time. Careful 
searching reveals the trolls left recently and moved deeper into the 
Troll Fens, and, as the PCs follow, they find troll corpses littering 
the trail. Something really nasty is picking off the trolls and the 
human slaves.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2006-15%20-%20Paladin%20Quests_files/dx20070615_stealhook_troll.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="303" width="240"><b>Resting in Peace -- </b><i>Forgotten Realms</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Traveling in the Dragon Coast region, the PCs come 
across the body of a warrior of good along the roadway between Teziir 
and Easting. He has just died from multiple sword and spear wounds, and 
his blood still flows on the ground. <i>Speak with dead</i> reveals that
 he is Orlon Caraway, a veteran crusader against evil who had just 
recently heard the call of paladinhood. He had not become a paladin yet 
when he was slain by several men and women in a vicious attack. He 
reveals that he is a native of Eversult, and that he would like to be 
buried there. He does not want to be restored to life; he has had a good
 campaign against evil and his time has clearly come.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs take his body to Eversult, the family assumes
 that they are friends of Orlon's and invite them to attend the funeral.
 There, the trouble begins. As the body is being carried in state from 
the church to the plot, a group of men and women (who could be any 
humanoid race, but humans might work best) attack the funeral guests. 
These marauders, all in black with face masks on, slaughter the guests, 
and especially the members of Orlon's family, with gusto. If seriously 
opposed by the PCs, they flee, but try to take out Orlon's family first.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Campaign Adaptation</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A lot of human-ish foes are in this adventure, so when you bring it into your campaign world (assuming you don't run it in the <b>Forgotten Realms</b>), make use of <i>Complete Champion</i>, <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/957277200">Complete Scoundrel</a></i> (especially this one), <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953847200">Complete Mage</a></i>, and Complete anything else you want. <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/news/20070401c">Complete Riding Dog</a></i> could even be useful.

<p align="LEFT"><b>Eberron:</b> Breland has enough intrigue and wealthy 
families for this adventure. Ardev is especially good, because the 
conflict could expand to include Cyran refugees. Hatheril is also 
suitable. If you run your campaign in Shar, you can fit the adventure 
there.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Generic: </b>Set this adventure in any city or town 
where a somewhat wealthy family could have a scion that fights evil and 
wants to become a paladin (or wants to betray his/her family). A lot of 
options are available here. If no pirates operate nearby and you like 
that complication, make them into barge pirates or land-bound smugglers 
or whatever.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greyhawk: </b>Ahlissa is a good place for this 
adventure; Chathold is especially good. The Hold of the Sea Princes, now
 taken over by the Scarlet Brotherhood, would also work well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Modern: </b>Try a small city or town in Asia or 
Australia. Asia may have a better feel, since this seems like a samurai 
adventure, but Australia could work very well in the frontier regions.</p>

<p align="LEFT">00-35 Any surviving members of Orlon's family would like
 the PCs to find out who is behind this attack and make sure that 
another one doesn't happen.</p>
<p align="LEFT">36-65 A remote cousin, who lives in the nearby town of 
Ilipur, hired a thieves' guild to kill the rest of the family so that he
 could inherit all the family property.</p>
<p align="LEFT">66-80 Orlon himself is behind the attacks, even though 
he's dead. He actually does want to be restored to life, but only after 
the rest of the family is killed off. He hired the thieves and 
sacrificed his own life to throw off suspicion. In responding to <i>speak with dead</i> spells, he avoids answering about his own involvement.</p>
<p align="LEFT">81-00 Surviving members of the family want the rogues 
killed (not caught) because the family hired them to kill any 
competitors in business at the funeral and the rogues turned on them. In
 this case, Orlon is an innocent pawn that the family could not let fall
 into "goodness" by becoming a paladin. </p>

Nightmasks, the powerful thieves' guild of Westgate. Crossing them could
 get the PCs in real trouble.</p>
<p align="LEFT">51-75 An old enemy of the family has been nursing 
thoughts of vengeance for decades. Recently turned into a vampire, he or
 she has used newfound powers to dominate some skilled cutthroats to 
enact revenge.</p>
<p align="LEFT">76-00 The family is allied with some pirates from the 
Pirate Isles, while the attackers are other pirates. The whole affair is
 in reality a war between pirate factions, and the PCs are going to have
 to go to the isles and deal with pirates to get to the truth.</p>
