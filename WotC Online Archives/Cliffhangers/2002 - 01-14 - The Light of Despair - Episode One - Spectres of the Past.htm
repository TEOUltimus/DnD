 is a short adventure for four 5th-level characters. The adventure takes
 the characters from the high plateau of a semi-seaside community down a
 steep cliff and to a haunted lighthouse long disused. It is an 
acceptable challenge for characters of levels 4-6. It is not adaptable 
to lower-level characters due to the creatures involved, and 
higher-level characters would find it far too easy. It uses the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/images/mapofweek/Jan_9x4L3c.jpg">Lighthouse map</a> from the January 2001 Map-a-Week feature.</p>

<p class="size2">The one constant throughout all of the episodes is the weather.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Weather:</b> The DM should consider having one of 
two things happen during the story when it comes to weather: drizzle or 
sun. Using the sun makes the storms that the ghost calls forth even more
 impressive. However, setting a more horror-oriented mood with a gray 
day full of drizzle and a hint of chill to the air might be even more 
effective. Gauge it by how your players normally react to situations 
with their characters. You could even start with a sunny, brisk day and 
transition it into more gloomy, threatening weather as the PCs approach 
the lighthouse. Just keep in mind that the ghost has her own ways with 
the weather!</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Adventure Background</b></p><b></b><blockquote>
<p class="size2">The country of Oceanside rests atop a plateau some 300 
feet above the sea. Steep cliffs drop off from the countryside to the 
sea; there are no beaches. Access to the sea is accomplished through the
 neighboring nations. Oceanside therefore has no sea trade of its own, 
as it has no natural harbors. At the foot of the cliffs, jagged reef 
beds prevent ships from approaching. Oceanside built a lighthouse at the
 base of the cliffs, on a small spur at the seaside of the reef beds, to
 warn ships away from the dangerous reefs, which extend almost a mile 
from the cliffs. Many a ship had been lost on the reefs before the 
lighthouse was built.</p>
<p class="size2">Just about one hundred years ago, a band of smugglers 
took over the lighthouse and killed the old keeper. The smugglers put 
one of their own in his place and used the lighthouse to signal their 
comrades. They also doused the light on bad nights when ships laden with
 particularly valuable cargoes sailed past, causing the ships to 
flounder on the reefs and sink. The smugglers then salvaged what they 
could. This went on for some time, until they made a fatal mistake. The 
smugglers believed that the final ship that passed them carried a rich 
load of gold, but in fact it conveyed a family and its possessions. The 
family was journeying to the neighboring country when their ship sailed 
too close to the cliffs, floundered on the reefs, and broke apart. The 
daughter of the house, Ferrina, a bright young girl of nine years, was 
sleeping when the ship wrecked, and she awoke to the terror of drowning.
 This experience caused her to return as a ghost.</p>
<p class="size2"> When she became a ghost, she flew to the lighthouse, 
as it was the closest building. There, she terrorized the smugglers and 
drove them away, realizing that if the light had been lit her family 
would have been safe. The smugglers fled, and most died in the terrible 
storms that she brought down on them. A very few escaped, and one of 
them carried the key to the vault where the smugglers had stored their 
salvaged loot. The lighthouse quickly gained a reputation for being 
haunted, and any ship that approached found itself buffeted by storms 
and dashed to destruction of the reef.</p>
<p class="size2">Now, a hundred years later, one of the descendents of 
the smugglers has returned to the lighthouse to claim the treasure. The 
adventurers encounter him dying on the road, and they may find 
themselves swept into the adventure.</p>
</blockquote><b><p class="size2">Character Hooks</p></b><blockquote>
<p class="size2">The characters could have several reasons for being in the area: </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One of them could include a tale or song that the party's bard hears
 that involves a ghostly lighthouse haunted by a banshee or a storm 
goddess. This particular song could strike a chord with the bard, even 
going so far as to haunt his or her dreams until the bard seeks out the 
source of the tale.<br><br></li>
<li>The heroes could also be asked by local authorities to investigate 
the local lore of the lighthouse and find out why it has been abandoned.<br><br></li>
<li>The nearest town may need a boost to its trade and could ask the PCs
 to figure out the reason why the lighthouse is shunned. (Of course, the
 heroes are armed with some local lore regarding storms before they head
 on out.)<br><br></li>
<li>Finally, the characters could be a victim of the storms that come up
 suddenly as they near the coastline where the lighthouse stands.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Spectres of the Past (EL 6)</b></p><b></b><blockquote>
<p class="size2">The adventurers begin on the road, traveling through 
Oceanside for whatever reason you have given them previously in the 
campaign. They come across this scene:</p>
</blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E9E9E9" width="85%"><tbody><tr><td>You
 see ahead of you some equipment strewn across the road. It looks like 
something threw everything around, but from this distance it is hard to 
make out details.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">When they get closer, go ahead and roll initiative for 
the NPC and the PCs. You can present the rest and then go into rounds 
after you've read it: </p>
</blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E9E9E9" width="85%"><tbody><tr><td>In
 the midst of the strewn traveling gear you see a body. It appears to be
 a male, probably human, with light brown hair, but as it is on its face
 you cannot tell for sure. A gaping wound in his back and the strewn and
 destroyed equipment tell you that he was attacked on the road, possibly
 robbed, and left for dead. Whether he is dead or not, you cannot tell.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">This is Killis, a grandson of one of the smugglers. He 
is just about dead, but not quite. Three others attacked him and tore 
his equipment and clothing apart looking for the key to the lighthouse 
vault, but they did not find it. They are not far away, though.</p>
<p class="size2">When the characters approach Killis, he groans 
slightly. He is at -9 hit points and will die unless he stabilizes by 
himself on his initiative or is healed in some manner before he makes 
his stabilization roll., and he spends that whole time coughing and 
choking. He is coughing because when he was attacked, he swallowed the 
key to the lighthouse when the attackers were not looking. That is why 
they did not find it. If a character turns him over, he points toward 
the lighthouse (which the PCs can't actually see) and groans again 
before expiring.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Killis: </b>Male War1; CR 1/2; Medium-size humanoid 
(Human); HD 1d8+3; hp 7* (-9); Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 14 (touch 12, 
flat-footed 12); Atk +1 melee (1d6/19-20, short sword); AL NG; SV Fort 
+5, Ref +2, Will +0; Str 11, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 17.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Climb +1, Handle Animal +5, Intimidate +5, Jump +1, Listen +2, Ride (horse) +4, Spot +2, Swim +2; Alertness, Run.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Possessions:</i> Padded armor, buckler, short sword, key.</p>
<p class="size2">*Killis normally has up to 7 hp. At this point in time, he has only -9.</p>
<p class="size2">Examining his body, the PCs find that he was choking on
 a pewter key -- one of very old design. The rest of his gear, normal 
stuff for a traveler who also used to be a guard, is torn apart. Pouches
 are slashed beyond use, his backpack is shredded, and his clothing and 
armor is ripped at the seams. Someone was looking for something.</p>
<p class="size2">To get more information, the characters have to use <i>speak with dead</i> spells if he has expired. Either dead or alive, they can learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is Killis, and he was traveling to the old abandoned lighthouse at the base of the cliffs.<br><br></li>
<li>He is the descendant of some people who used the lighthouse to store riches, and he has the only key to the vault.<br><br></li>
<li>He thought he was the only surviving descendant.<br><br></li>
<li>He does not know the full story of the smugglers and the ghost, so 
he cannot relate it. He can only say that his ancestors stopped using 
the lighthouse suddenly, because something came from the sea and killed 
most of them.<br><br></li>
<li>Killis is at the end of his luck, and hoped that the treasure from 
the lighthouse would make him rich (or at least no longer destitute). If
 asked what he did before he decided to come out here, he says nothing 
more than that he was once a guard. </li>
</ul>
<p class="size2">Hopefully, the characters take the hint and go to the 
lighthouse. Should Killis have survived the encounter, he wishes to go 
along and offers part of his "inheritance" if they accept him. Keep in 
mind that the addition of Killis to the group can affect the PCs 
rewards.</p>
<p class="size2">Though they do not know it, the group is about two 
hours' walk from the cliffs, and the road they are on has a branch that 
runs along the cliffs. (If Killis is alive, he can mention the latter 
bit of information.) The cliffs are very scenic, and people like to go 
look at them (or down them). About an hour later, they run into the 
three ruffians who attacked Killis. Read the following if Killis isn't 
with the group:</p>
</blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E9E9E9" width="85%"><tbody><tr><td>Your
 walk on this road is interrupted as a woman steps from the brush and 
blocks your path. "Hold up, strangers. I know you saw a man lying in the
 road a ways back. He had something that belongs to me, and I want it. 
Just hand it over, and I won't have to hurt you." She looks very tough 
and is probably well able to make good on her threat via the greataxe 
she carries.</td>

<p class="size2">This is Marna, and she wants the key. If the characters
 play dumb, she comes out and say so. If they refuse, she raises her 
greataxe and looks menacing. That is the signal for her comrades to 
attack from ambush. See Tactics for more information on how the battle 
begins, and please note the potions that have been consumed just prior 
to the combat. If they attempt to talk to her or use any social-based or
 magical-based actions to get her to back down or calm her, allow them 
to do so. The second Marna suspects something on the part of the PCs

<p class="size2"><i>Possessions: +1 chainmail</i>, masterwork greataxe, <i>potion of cure moderate wounds, *potion of bull's strength</i> (consumed before the encounter starts).</p>

 Weapon Finesse (short sword).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Sneak Attack: </i>If Kurann's target would be denied
 his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether he actually has a bonus or not), or 
when he flanks his target, the rogue's attack deals +2d6 points of extra
 damage. If the attack scores a critical hit, this extra damage is not 
multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target
 is within 30 feet. With a sap or an unarmed strike, Kurann can make a 
sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal damage. He 
cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage to deal subdual damage with
 a sneak attack. Kurann can sneak attack only living creatures with 
discernable anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is 
not vulnerable to sneak attacks. Kurann must be able to see the target 
well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a vital 
spot.He cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment 
or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Evasion (Ex):</i> If exposed to any effect that 
normally allows Kurann to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage,
 he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Half-Elf Traits: </i>Immune to magic sleep spells 
and effects; +2 racial bonus to Will saves against enchantment spells or
 effects; low-light vision (can see twice as far as a human in low-light
 conditions); +1 racial bonus to Listen, Spot, and Search checks 
(already figured into the statistics given above).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Traps: </i>Kurann can use the Search skill to locate
 traps when the task has a DC higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap 
has a DC of at least 20, higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic 
trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Kurann 
can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. Disabling a 
magic trop generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to 
create it. If Kurann beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable 
Device check, he can generally study a trap, figure out how it works, 
and bypass it (with his party) without disarming it.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Temporary Effects: </i>Just prior to this encounter, Kurann consumed his <i>potion of cat's grace. </i>While
 that is in effect, the following changes apply: AC 18 (touch 15,

<p class="size2"><i>Temporary Effects: </i>Just prior to this encounter, Lorden cast <i>expeditious retreat</i> and <i>shield, </i>and consumed his <i>potion of invisibility</i> and <i>potion of sneaking. </i>While these are in effect, the following changes apply: Spd 60 ft.; AC 19 (touch 12, flat-footed 17); SQ <i>Invisibility;</i>

<p class="size2"><b>Tactics:</b> When Marna's companions attack, she 
closes to melee. When possible, she will work with Kurann to flank a PC,
 even if that is not the PC she is fighting. Note her enhanced abilities
 from consuming potions.</p>
<p class="size2">Kurann, the rogue, is hiding in the brush to Marna's 
right, about 25 feet from the PCs and a little behind. Characters 
looking at the brush during the confrontation can make Spot checks 
against. Kurann's Hide skill to see him before he attacks. When he 
attacks, he fires arrows before Marna closes, and he moves into melee 
when she does. He tries to position himself so that he can flank PCs. 
Note his enhanced abilities due to potions.</p>
<p class="size2">Lorden, the sorcerer, is invisible and on Marna's left,
 about 20 feet from the PCs and directly abreast of them. He begins with
 wands, first summoning a monster using <i>summon monster I</i> as Marna
 speaks (so it appears when the combat begins). Then he fires magic 
missiles from his other wand and summons another monster should his 
first one die. Once the PCs close with him, he uses the wands and casts 
spells as the situation warrants. He casts defensively if needed.</p>
<p class="size2">Once these three are defeated, the PCs can question them (or question their corpses if they have <i>speak with dead</i> spells available). They can learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>These three descended from some smugglers that used the lighthouse below the cliffs as a base.<br><br></li>
<li>Something happened, and a monster came from the sea and drove away 
the smugglers. Most were killed, but a few escaped. They were to meet up
 on the shore, but the one with the key to the vaults did not show up. 
The survivors assumed he was killed.<br><br></li>
<li>Just last year, small pieces of information led the descendents to 
believe that the smuggler bearing the key survived, and had descendents 
of his own.<br><br></li>
<li>Marna and Kurann had just tracked Killis when he left for the 
lighthouse. They followed, ambushed him on the road, and searched him 
but did not find the key.<br><br></li>
<li>They saw the PCs leaving the area where Killis' body was left, and thought that they might have found the key.</li>
</ul>

lighthouse. The day is calm, and a little overcast. The scene is
