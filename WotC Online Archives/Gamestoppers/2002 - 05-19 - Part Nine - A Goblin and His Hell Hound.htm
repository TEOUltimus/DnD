<p class="size2">In this installment of Gamestoppers, we take a look at 
the mounted combat rules. Last month, the group defeated a specter that 
was guarding a large door, but not before it bestowed a large number of 
negative levels on the party. The group retreated and rested, gaining 
assistance from a nearby cleric. After returning to the area, the group 
pried the door open and entered the large chamber they found beyond. 
It's a huge temple! Unfortunately for them, the noise they made and time
 they took bashing open the door has given an old nemesis plenty of time
 to prepare. The goblin high priest Torgulbek and his mount Yarkle are 
ready to defend their lair ...</p>

<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Right. The door explodes inward in a shower 
of splinters and rubble, and Krusk staggers into the huge temple chamber
 beyond. You catch a glance at the hideous carvings on the pillars 
supporting the roof and the leering, glowing statue of Maglubiyet 
looming over an altar in the far end of the room before seeing a 
familiar face grinning at you from the other end of the chamber. It's 
the goblin priest you've been chasing! And he's mounted on a hell hound!</p>

<p class="size2"><b>PC (Vadania):</b> Finally! About time we caught up with the blighter...</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk):</b> ROARRRR! KRUSK NOT WASTE ALL OF HIS BARBARIAN RAGE ON STUPID DOOR AFTER ALL!!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> I guess that means it is time to roll initiative.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>[Everyone rolls. Lidda gets a 24, Nebin gets a 17, 
Torgulbek the goblin cleric gets a 14, Vadania gets an 8, and Krusk gets
 a 7. Since Yarkle is Torgulbek's mount, he goes on the same initiative 
rank as his rider.]</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> You're up first, Lidda!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Lidda):</b> Well, the goblin is, what, 80 feet away? That's too far away for a sneak attack. I duck into the room and drink my last <i>potion of invisibility</i>.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> All right. Nebin is next.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Nebin):</b> Well, it won't hurt the hell hound, but it should fry the goblin something good. I lob a <i>fireball</i> into the far end of the temple!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> All right. The blast of fire momentarily 
blinds the group, but when your eyes adjust a second later, you can tell
 that neither the hell hound NOR the goblin seem to have been affected 
by the fire.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Nebin):</b> WHAT! Crud. Well, I'm gonna duck to the side out of his line of sight.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Right; it's the goblin's turn. He whips out a
 potion and gulps it down, and he suddenly moves a LOT faster. With a 
roar, he kicks the hell hound's flanks and runs right at you, Krusk. 
He's guiding his mount with his knees so he can wield his heavy mace (it
 takes both hands for him to do so since he's Small), so he needs to 
make a Ride check against a DC of 5. He can't miss with his +14 modifier
 to the Ride check. He then barrels down on you, Krusk, and tries to 
bean you with the mace. <i>[The DM rolls to hit and gets a 14, plus the 
goblin's +18 attack bonus and +2 from the charge equals a total of 34. 
He cannot make a full attack since his mount moved more than 5 feet to 
reach Krusk.]</i> A hit! Since the goblin has the Spirited Charge feat, he does double damage. <i>[Rolls 1d8+8 twice.] </i>He causes 23 points of damage!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk):</b> Wow. Krusk is almost impressed by the puny soon-to-be-dead goblin.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> He's not done yet. He also has the Ride-By 
Attack, so he continues on by you for another 30 feet. You don't get an 
attack of opportunity on him thanks to the feat. Your turn, Vadania!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Vadania):</b> I step into the room and blast the freak with an <i>ice storm</i>!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Okay, but first, you'll have to penetrate the goblin's spell resistance.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Vadania):</b> Huh? Okay. <i>[Vadania makes a check and gets a result of 20.]</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Not good enough. The goblin doesn't seem to be hurt by the spell. His mount, however, is quite affected. Roll up some damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>[Vadania rolls and gets a result of 6 points of cold
 damage and 13 points of impact damage. Since the hell hound has the 
Fire subtype, it takes double damage from cold, for a total of 25 points
 of damage! This would have been enough to disable the hell hound if it 
weren't for the </i>aid<i> spell Torgulbek had cast upon it earlier.]</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> OOF! You didn't hurt the goblin, but you did
 a number on the hell hound, which yelps in pain as the ice lances into 
it. Okay, next up is Krusk.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk):</b> Krusk not happy with being menaced 
by hell hound cavalry. I run up to the hell hound and chop its legs out 
from under it with my axe!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Okay; you make the 30 feet to the pair with no problem; make your attack!</p>
<p class="size2"><i>[Krusk gets a result of 29 on his attack.]</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Whoa! Well, normally that would be a solid 
hit. But the goblin doesn't fancy you mangling his precious mount, so 
he's going to use his Mounted Combat feat to negate the hit. He needs to
 make a Ride check against a DC of your attack result of 29. <i>[The DM rolls the die and gets an 18, which modifies up to 32 with the goblin's Ride check modifier of +14.]</i> Whew! That was close. The goblin pulls the hell hound back just in time to avoid your attack.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk):</b> GRARRRRGHHH!!!! STUPID GOBLIN WILL PAY FOR MAKING KRUSK LOOK FOOLISH!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Your turn again, Lidda!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Lidda):</b> I make a double move action to get a bit closer to the goblin. Don't want to lose my <i>invisibility</i> on anything but a sneak attack!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Right! You're up, Nebin!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Nebin):</b> I cast <i>haste</i> on myself, and then I cast <i>displacement</i>
 with my hasted action. I'm not going up against that guy without some 
defenses! Who knows what tricks a goblin with spell resistance might 
have up his sleeve?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> So now it's the goblin's turn. First, he 
directs the hell hound to attack Krusk. Since the hell hound is trained 
for battle, he needs to make only a Ride check against DC 10 to fight 
with his hell hound. The hell hound tries to bite you <i>[DM rolls a die]</i> and misses, but you do take 3 points of fire damage from its breath. <i>[Krusk makes a Reflex save to halve the damage.]</i> Now, the goblin himself takes a swing at you with his weapon. <i>[Since
 the mount has not moved more than 5 feet, the goblin could have taken a
 full attack action against Krusk, but he chooses not to do so in case 
he needs to get away from the barbarian.]</i> He hits for 14 points of 
damage. Luckily, he wasn't charging and he can't use his Spirited Charge
 feat as a result. He also reaches down to touch the hell hound and 
casts a <i>cure critical wounds</i> on it. <i>[The DM rolls 4d8+10 to determine damage healed and gets a 29.] </i>With a flash of red light, all of the monster's wounds vanish!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk): </b>Not for long . . .</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Okay; it's your turn Vadania.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Vadania):</b> We have to get that goblin off that monster. I guess I'll hit it with a <i>flame strike</i>. At least half the damage will get through, and it might hurt the goblin, too! <i>[Vadania rolls spell resistance.]</i> Woot! A 34! Better than last time, at least.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Okay; the blast of fire shoots down to hit 
both of them. Shockingly, the goblin doesn't seem to suffer any damage 
at all from the spell. The hell hound, of course, is immune to the fire 
damage, but <i>flame strike</i> deals holy damage as well, so you can go ahead and roll half your damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>[The DM makes a Reflex save for the hell hound and fails miserably. It takes 18 points of damage from the portion of the </i>flame strike<i> that deals holy damage.]</i></p>

<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk):</b> Stupid gobo uses Mounted Combat against Krusk's attack again?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Yep. Let's see. <i>[The DM rolls a die.]</i> Made the Ride check!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Krusk):</b> ARRRRRGHHH! No more hitting fire dog for Krusk!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Okay. You're up again, Lidda!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Lidda):</b> Great! Looks like the guy is within 
30 feet, so I'm gonna take a shot at the hell hound with my bow. I'm 
still invisible so it'll get the sneak attack damage, right?</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> Yep.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Lidda):</b> But, it's a new round, and seeing Krusk miss due to some fancy riding . . . crud. Oh well, I'll shoot the goblin instead. <i>[Lidda
 rolls her two bow attacks and hits once, doing a total of 21 points of 
damage with the ranged sneak attack to the goblin cleric.]</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> That got his attention! Your turn, Nebin!</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Nebin):</b> Okay, enough with the hell hound. I step into the room and blast it with a <i>magic missile</i> spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM:</b> That should do it. The poor hell hound doesn't have much in the way of defenses there. Roll your damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>[Nebin rolls and does 13 points of damage.]</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>DM: </b>BANG! The hell hound yelps one last time and
 keels over on its side. The goblin curses as he goes down, but he still
 gets to make a Ride check against DC 15 to make a soft fall. <i>[The DM gets a result of 19.] </i>The
 goblin falls clear of the saddle just as the hell hound crashes to the 
ground. Still, he's starting to look a little nervous, what with Krusk 
standing over him . . .</p>
<p class="size2"><b>PC (Nebin):</b> Ha! Not so tough without your hell hound, are you?</p>

<p class="size2">As the combat continues, Krusk goes after the goblin 
and inflicts a lucky critical hit with his axe, doing much damage to 
Torgulbek. Krusk does enough damage that the priest has become desperate
 enough to call in reinforcements.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Where to Look:</b> The rules for the Ride skill are given on pages 72-73 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. Additional rules for mounted combat appear on page 138. </p>
