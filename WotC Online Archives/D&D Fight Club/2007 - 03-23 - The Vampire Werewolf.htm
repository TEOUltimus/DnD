<p align="LEFT">Many people on the Wizards Message Boards expressed 
interest in a vampire werewolf, and some even suggested it was an 
impossible creature. Humanoid werewolf vampires are allowed, even if 
both are acquired templates. They were not in v. 3.0 because werewolves 
had the shapechanger type, but now that shapechanger is a subtype it 
does not prevent vampirism.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#F2F2F2" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The only objection to this creature is not that it can 
or cannot exist, but whether all the lycanthropic forms are available to
 it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This objection is rooted in the concept that undead 
cannot use the wild shape ability, as stated in the description of the 
Corrupt Wildshape feat from <i>Libris Mortis</i> , which says: "You have
 learned to use the necromantic energy that powers your undead form to 
overcome the inability of undead creatures to wild shape. You can assume
 the form of an undead, rotten creature with the use of your wild shape 
ability."</p>
<p align="LEFT">One could claim, therefore, that undead creatures in 
general cannot use the alternate form ability (upon which wild shape is 
based) to assume other forms. However, vampires can use the alternate 
form ability; the template says so specifically. Thus, you could also 
argue that vampires are an exception to the general principle that 
undead cannot use the alternate form ability, and allow vampires to 
change into anything that the base creature could have changed into.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's really up to you, but it makes sense to this author
 to allow it. If you don't want to, however, then eliminate the hybrid 
form statistics below and go with the orc and dire wolf form (since 
vampires can assume dire wolf form) and reduce the physical ability 
scores on the dire wolf form to normal for a standard dire wolf.</p>

<p align="LEFT">As with all lycanthropes, there are three stat blocks 
for each version. This one prefers hybrid form because it has the most 
advantages, but is comfortable in orc form as well. She rarely chooses 
dire wolf form. The second and third stat blocks present only changes to
 the first one, to save space. In all cases, it is assumed that the 
creature was born a werewolf and became a vampire after acquiring all 
class levels.</p>

 the colony of orc werewolves, Nadezda wasn't that special or even 
noticed. As one among many in the pack, she took her place like everyone
 else. She trained as a scout and hunted food for the tribe. On her last
 hunt, lycanthrope-hating paladins and clerics wiped out her whole tribe
 while she was away, and she returned to a burned village and piles of 
charred corpses. As she grieved and buried her kin that night, a vampire
 attacked her.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Nadezda prefers hybrid form, and always has, but her new
 vampiric powers make it even more preferable. She likes using all her 
powers and her weapons, and hybrid is the only form in which she can. 
She still fights like a scout, moving to gain her skirmish damage and AC
 bonus when she can. If she can catch a meal (er . . . foe) alone, even 
briefly, she tries to dominate it before attacking, and she has kept 
dominated minions around for a while to help her kill other prey.</p>

 Nadezda relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her 
defense. She deals an extra 2d6 points of damage on all attacks she 
makes during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet away from 
where she was at the start of her turn. The extra damage applies only to
 attacks made after Nadezda has moved at least 10 feet. The skirmish 
ability cannot be used while mounted. The extra damage applies only 
against living creatures that have a discernible anatomy. Undead, 
constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune 
to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional
 damage. Nadezda must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a
 vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Nadezda can apply 
this extra damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if 
the target is within 30 feet. Additionally, Nadezda gains a +1 
competence bonus (not included above) to Armor Class during any round in
 which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the 
scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blood Drain (Ex)</b> Nadezda can suck blood from a 
living victim with her fangs by making a successful grapple check. If 
she pins the foe, she drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution 
drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, 
Nadezda gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Children of the Night (Su)</b> Nadezda commands the 
lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat 
swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. 
These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve Nadezda for up to 1 hour.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Create Spawn (Su) </b> A humanoid or monstrous 
humanoid slain by Nadezda 's energy drain rises as a vampire spawn 1d4 
days after burial. If Nadezda instead drains the victim's Constitution 
to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and 
was a humanoid or monstrous humanoid, and as a monstrous vampire if it 
had 5 or more HD and was an aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, 
humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or vermin. In either case, 
the new monstrous vampire or vampire spawn is under the command of 
Nadezda and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any 
given time Nadezda may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice 
her own Hit Dice; any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit are
 created as free-willed monstrous vampires or vampire spawn. A monstrous
 vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a 
master monstrous vampire can control a number of lesser monstrous 
vampires in this fashion. Nadezda may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn
 in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a monstrous vampire or
 vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) </b> Any humanoid or giant 
hit by this creature's bite attack (while it's in animal or hybrid form)
 must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dominate (Su)</b> Nadezda can crush an opponent's 
will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze 
attack, except that Nadezda must use a standard action, and those merely
 looking at Nadezda are not affected. Anyone Nadezda targets must 
succeed on a Will save (DC 16) or fall instantly under Nadezda 's 
influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> Living creatures hit by Nadezda
 's slam attack (or any other natural weapon Nadezda possesses) gain two
 negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, Nadezda gains 5 
temporary hit points. Nadezda can use her energy drain ability once per 
round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alternate Form (Su) </b> Nadezda can shift into dire 
wolf form. She does not assume the ability scores of the animal, but 
instead adds the animal's physical ability score modifiers to her own 
ability scores. Nadezda also can assume a bipedal hybrid form with 
prehensile hands and animalistic features. Nadezda can also assume the 
shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. While
 in her alternate form, Nadezda loses her natural slam attack and 
dominate ability, but she gains the natural weapons and extraordinary 
special attacks of her new form. She can remain in that form until she 
assumes another or until the next sunrise.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gaseous Form (Su)</b> As a standard action, Nadezda 
can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but she
 can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with 
perfect maneuverability.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)</b> In any form, Nadezda 
can communicate and empathize with normal or dire wolves. This gives her
 a +4 racial bonus on checks when influencing the animal's attitude and 
allows the communication of simple concepts and (if the animal is 
friendly) commands, such as "friend," "foe," "flee," and "attack."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spider Climb (Ex)</b> Nadezda can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trip (Ex)</b> If Nadezda hits with a bite attack, she
 can attempt to trip her opponent (+19 check modifier) as a free action 
without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If 
the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip Nadezda .</p>

 years of serving a temple of Gruumsh as a pious templar, Nadezda became
 disillusioned with religion and wandered the world again. Along the way
 she met a druid and learned much from him about shapechanging and 
controlling her body. But wanderlust called again, and she was on the 
verge of departing when a vampire attacked them both.</p>
<p align="left">Now she feels pretty much immune to everything, and 
fights with more recklessness than she did in the past. She also feels 
more like a parent, and she uses her dominate ability to dominate those 
foes she has defeated and infected with lycanthropy. Slowly she is 
building a new tribe for herself, and as some of her charges grow fully 
into their new abilities, she turns them into vampires as well. Thus, 
her new tribe is a mix of werewolves and vampire werewolves. They are a 
terror to the surrounding countryside, but they have a good den that is 
well hidden, and they take care not to prey too much on the surrounding 
people.</p>

 If a pious templar makes a successful Will or Fortitude saving throw 
that would normally reduce the spell's effect, she suffers no effect 
from the spell at all. Only those spells with a Saving Throw entry of 
"Will partial," "Fortitude half," or similar entries can be negated 
through this ability.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Skirmish (Ex)</b> Nadezda relies on mobility to deal 
extra damage and improve her defense. She deals an extra 2d6 points of 
damage on all attacks she makes during any round in which she moves at 
least 10 feet away from where she was at the start of her turn. The 
extra damage applies only to attacks made after Nadezda has moved at 
least 10 feet. The skirmish ability cannot be used while mounted. The 
extra damage applies only against living creatures that have a 
discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal 
creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are 
not vulnerable to this additional damage. Nadezda must be able to see 
the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to 
reach such a spot. Nadezda can apply this extra damage to ranged attacks
 made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet. 
Additionally, Nadezda gains a +1 competence bonus (not included above) 
to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The
 bonus applies as soon as the scout has moved 10 feet, and lasts until 
the start of her next turn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Smite (Ex)</b> Once per day, Nadezda may make a 
single melee attack with a +4 attack bonus and a +4 damage bonus. She 
must declare the smite before making the attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blood Drain (Ex)</b> Nadezda can suck blood from a 
living victim with her fangs by making a successful grapple check. If 
she pins the foe, she drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution 
drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, 
Nadezda gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Children of the Night (Su)</b> Nadezda commands the 
lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat 
swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. 
These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve Nadezda for up to 1 hour.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Create Spawn (Su) </b> A humanoid or monstrous 
humanoid slain by Nadezda 's energy drain rises as a vampire spawn 1d4 
days after burial. If Nadezda instead drains the victim's Constitution 
to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and 
was a humanoid or monstrous humanoid, and as a monstrous vampire if it 
had 5 or more HD and was an aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, 
humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, or vermin. In either case, 
the new monstrous vampire or vampire spawn is under the command of 
Nadezda and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. At any 
given time Nadezda may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice 
her own Hit Dice; any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit are
 created as free-willed monstrous vampires or vampire spawn. A monstrous
 vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a 
master monstrous vampire can control a number of lesser monstrous 
vampires in this fashion. Nadezda may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn
 in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a monstrous vampire or
 vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) </b> Any humanoid or giant 
hit by this creature's bite attack (while it's in animal or hybrid form)
 must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dominate (Su)</b> Nadezda can crush an opponent's 
will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze 
attack, except that Nadezda must use a standard action, and those merely
 looking at Nadezda are not affected. Anyone Nadezda targets must 
succeed on a Will save (DC 21) or fall instantly under Nadezda 's 
influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Energy Drain (Su)</b> Living creatures hit by Nadezda
 's slam attack (or any other natural weapon Nadezda possesses) gain two
 negative levels. For each negative level bestowed, Nadezda gains 5 
temporary hit points. Nadezda can use her energy drain ability once per 
round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Alternate Form (Su) </b> Nadezda can shift into dire 
wolf form. She does not assume the ability scores of the animal, but 
instead adds the animal's physical ability score modifiers to her own 
ability scores. Nadezda also can assume a bipedal hybrid form with 
prehensile hands and animalistic features. Nadezda can also assume the 
shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. While
 in her alternate form, Nadezda loses her natural slam attack and 
dominate ability, but she gains the natural weapons and extraordinary 
special attacks of her new form. She can remain in that form until she 
assumes another or until the next sunrise.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gaseous Form (Su)</b> As a standard action, Nadezda 
can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but she
 can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with 
perfect maneuverability.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)</b> In any form, Nadezda 
can communicate and empathize with normal or dire wolves. This gives her
 a +4 racial bonus on checks when influencing the animal's attitude and 
allows the communication of simple concepts and (if the animal is 
friendly) commands, such as "friend," "foe," "flee," and "attack."</p>
<p align="left"><b>Morphic Body (Su)</b> Nadezda can use her precise 
control over her form to make herself stronger. When in any form except 
her orc form, she gains +4 to Strength (included above).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Morphic Reach (Su)</b> Nadezda can suddenly stretch 
her limbs, neck, or other appendages outward, giving her 5 more feet of 
reach than the creature she's emulating (included above). Unlike most 
creatures, warshapers don't appear to have a longer reach until they 
actually use it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Morphic Weapons (Su)</b> As a move action, Nadezda 
can grow natural weapons such as claws or fangs, allowing a natural 
attack that deals the appropriate amount of damage according to the size
 of the new form (see Table 5-1 on page 296 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 ). These morphic weapons need not be natural weapons that the creature 
already possesses. She can also grow her claws or bite so that they deal
 damage as if they were one category larger (not included). She can 
change morphic weapons as often as she likes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spider Climb (Ex)</b> Nadezda can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trip (Ex)</b> If Nadezda hits with a bite attack, she
 can attempt to trip her opponent (+29 check modifier) as a free action 
without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If 
the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip Nadezda.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Additional Feats </b></p>
<p align="left">These feats are not presented in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> or <i>Monster Manual</i> , so here are a few summaries about each one.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elusive Target (from <i>Complete Warrior</i> ):</b> The Elusive Target feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Negate Power Attack: </i> To use this maneuver, you 
must designate a specific foe to be affected by your Dodge feat. If that
 foe uses the Power Attack feat against you, the foe gains no bonus on 
the damage roll but still takes the corresponding penalty on the attack 
roll.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Diverting Defense: </i> To use this maneuver, you 
must be flanked and you must designate one of the flanking attackers to 
be affected by your Dodge feat. The first attack of the round from the 
designated attacker automatically misses you and may strike the other 
flanking foe instead; the attacking creature makes an attack roll 
normally, and its ally is considered flat-footed. If the designated 
attacker is making a full attack against you, its second and subsequent 
attacks function normally.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Cause Overreach: </i> To use this maneuver, you must 
provoke an attack of opportunity from a foe by moving out of a 
threatened square. If the foe misses you, you can make a free trip 
attempt against this foe, and the foe does not get a chance to trip you 
if your attempt fails.</p>
<p align="left"><b>True Believer (from <i>Complete Divine</i> ):</b> 
Once per day when you are about to make a saving throw you may declare 
that you are using this feat to gain a +2 insight bonus on that saving 
throw. This feat also allows you to use a relic of the deity you 
worship.</p>
