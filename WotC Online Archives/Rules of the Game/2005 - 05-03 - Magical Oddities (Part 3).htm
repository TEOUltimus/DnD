<p align="left">Last week, we completed our look at spell preparation 
and considered spells that are cast without preparation. We also 
explored what a spellcaster knows when a spell's subject makes a 
successful saving throw. This week, we'll consider other kinds of spell 
failure. We'll also consider the effects of metamagic.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>When Spells Fail </b></p>
<p align="left">A successful saving throw isn't the only thing that 
foils a spell. Sometimes, a spellcaster knows when one of these other 
circumstances has prevailed and other times he does not. Here's an 
overview:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Antimagic:</b> A spell's magical effects become nonfunctional within an area of antimagic, such as an <i>antimagic field</i>.
 When a spell is aimed into an area of antimagic from somewhere outside 
the area, the antimagic blocks line of effect for the spell and the 
spell most likely fails. If the spell doesn't produce any sort of 
visible display or manifestation that the caster (or other witness to 
the event) can perceive, then there's no clue as to why the spell failed
 or even that it has failed. If the blocked spell has a target entry, 
however, the caster will not note any failed or successful saving throws
 in response to the spell (see Part Two) and that in itself might alert 
the caster to something amiss.</p>
<p align="left">If the spell's effects are visible (for example, a <i>lightning bolt</i> or <i>magic missile </i>spell
 -- at least when I'm the DM), the spell's visible effects stop where 
they meet the area of antimagic. Anyone who sees the spell being blocked
 can attempt a DC 26 Spellcraft check to realize that antimagic has 
blocked the spell.</p>
<p align="left">When a spellcaster is inside an antimagic area, any 
spells she casts are suppressed. Such spells don't actually fail unless 
their durations are instantaneous. Spells with longer durations are 
suppressed until the caster somehow leaves the antimagic area (though 
time spent within the antimagic area counts against the spell's 
duration). If the caster isn't aware she's in an antimagic area, handle 
the situation in the same way you'd handle it if the caster has aimed a 
spell into the antimagic area from outside.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Arcane Spell Failure: </b>Wearing armor or using a 
shield can interfere with an arcane spell that has a somatic component. 
Arcane spells that don't have somatic components, and divine spells of 
all kinds, are not subject to arcane spell failure.</p>
<p align="left">When an arcane spellcaster fails an arcane spell failure
 roll, the spell fails and is completely wasted. Any material or XP 
components used in the spell also are wasted. No outwardly obvious sign 
indicates that the spell has failed due to an arcane spell failure roll 
(though the DM can create one as a house rule), but I recommend that the
 caster be aware of the failure immediately. The character realizes she 
has miscast the spell and probably feels the spell's power uselessly 
draining away.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lapse in Concentration:</b> A spell is completely 
ruined when any character has to make a Concentration check while 
casting a spell and fails the check. The spell is lost along with any 
material and XP component used in the spell. In most cases, the caster 
is aware of the failed check, though in some instances a character might
 not notice. For example, a character must make a Concentration check 
whenever she fails a saving throw while casting a spell. If the saving 
throw was from a spell that has no obvious physical effects (see Part 
Two), then the affected character is not aware that a hostile spell has 
affected her. The DM should secretly make the required Concentration 
check (the DC is equal to the hostile spell's saving throw DC; see the 
Concentration skill description). If the Concentration check fails, the 
spell is ruined.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Misaimed Spell:</b> A spell aimed at the wrong 
subject or place usually fails utterly. When a spell has a target entry,
 the caster must aim the spell at a target that can receive the spell. 
For example, a <i>magic missile</i> spell works only on creatures. If the caster aims a <i>magic missile</i>
 spell at an object (that is, anything that lacks a Charisma score and a
 Wisdom score), the spell fails. I recommend that DMs give the players 
no special clues about what's going on when a character misaims a spell.
 If something else is going on that might give a clue that a spell has 
failed, however, the caster still gets that clue. For example, a <i>charm person</i> spell works only when aimed at a humanoid. If someone aims a <i>charm person</i> effect at a giant, the spell fails. Because <i>charm person</i>
 also is a spell with a target entry, the caster will know if the target
 made a successful saving throw or not (see Part Two). In this example, 
the caster notes neither a successful nor a failed save.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Resistance:</b> When a subject has spell 
resistance, the caster must make a caster level check to overcome the 
resistance before the spell has any chance to take effect. I recommend 
that you handle the effects of spell resistance in the same way you 
handle saving throws. That is, when a targeted spell fails to overcome 
spell resistance, the caster knows what has happened.</p>
<p align="left">When a spell has an effect or area entry and no obvious 
physical effects, the caster cannot tell if the spell overcame a 
subject's spell resistance (if any).</p>
<p align="left">If a spell has an obvious physical effect, but has an 
effect or area entry, the caster might notice the spell's failure to 
overcome spell resistance by noting the absence of those effects. In 
some cases, the absence of such effects is fairly easy to notice. For 
example, the <i>burning hands</i> spell works at fairly short range and 
burns everything within the spell's area. It's fairly easy to notice 
when a foe has completely avoided all effects from the flames. In other 
cases, a DC 15 Spot check might be in order (remember that a -1 penalty 
applies to a Spot check for each 10 feet of distance between the 
observer and the subject).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Subject Immune to the Spell:</b> Immunity to spells 
works just like spell resistance that the spell cannot defeat. Follow 
the guidelines for spell resistance when a spell fails due to the 
subject's immunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Metamagic </b></p>
<p align="left">The various metamagic feats allow spellcasters to adjust their spells in various ways. In earlier versions of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, metamagic was available in the form of spells that altered other spells. The current game uses feats instead.</p>
<p align="left">The rules governing metamagic feats are detailed on see page 88 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> Several aspects of metamagic can prove troublesome in play. Here's an overview, along with some commentary.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can use most metamagic feats on spells you instinctively or spontaneously cast.<br><br>
 Applying a metamagic feat to such a spell increases the spell's casting
 time to a full-round action (or adds a full-round action to the casting
 time if it's normally longer than a standard action). The casting time 
increase makes applying the Quicken Spell feat a waste of effort (and a 
waste of a higher-level spell slot.<br><br> As noted in the<i> Player's Handbook, </i>casting
 a spell as a full-round action is not the same as casting a spell with a
 casting time of 1 full round. For example, a sorcerer applies the 
Silent Spell feat to <i>charm person</i> spell. The spell's casting time
 increases from a standard action to a full-round action. The spell 
takes effect during the same turn that the sorcerer cast the spell. If 
the same sorcerer casts a <i>summon monster I </i>spell, that spell 
doesn't take effect until the turn after the sorcerer casts the spell 
(just prior to the sorcerer's next turn). If our example sorcerer 
applies the Silent Spell feat to her <i>summon monster I </i>spell, the 
spell's casting time would be 1 full round plus a full-round action. The
 spell takes effect on the round after the sorcerer first cast the 
spell, but not until the sorcerer uses a full-round action to complete 
it.<br><br></li>
<li>You can apply several metamagic feats to a single spell.<br><br> You cannot, however, apply the same metamagic feat to a single spell more than once.<br><br>
 When adding several different metamagic feats to a single spell, add up
 the required level increases to determine what level spell slot is 
required for the enhanced spell. The <i>Player's Handbook</i> uses an example of a <i>charm person</i>
 spell modified with Still Spell and Silent Spell. Each of the example 
feats requires a spell slot one level higher than normal, so the 
modified spell requires a 3rd-level spell slot.<br><br></li>
<li>A spell modified with metamagic functions at its normal spell level,
 even though it requires a spell slot of higher level than normal.<br><br> Using our previous example of a <i>charm person</i>
 spell placed into 3rd-level spell slot because of metamagic, the spell 
functions as a 1st-level spell in all respects. If a wizard with an 
Intelligence score of 11 casts the spell, the saving throw DC is 11 (10 +
 1 [spell level] + 0 [Intelligence modifier]). The wizard can cast the 
modified spell even though his Intelligence score is only 11, which is 
sufficient for a 1st-level spell but not for a 3rd-level spell. All 
other variables or characteristics that depend on the example spell's 
level, such as its ability to penetrate a <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i> effect, function at the spell's original level (1st).<br><br>
 The Heighten Spell feat is an exception to the foregoing. When 
increasing a spell with the Heighten Spell feat, the spell functions at 
its increased level. For example a <i>charm person</i> spell heightened 
to 3rd level has a base save DC of 13, requires a relevant ability score
 of at least 13, and functions as a 3rd-level spell in all other 
respects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>

Next week, we'll conclude the series by considering a perennial 
troublesome magical effect: polymorphing.</p>
