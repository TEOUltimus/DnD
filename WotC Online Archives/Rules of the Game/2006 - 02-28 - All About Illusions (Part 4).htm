<p align="left">Last week, we explored what it means to interact with an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_illusionsubschool')">illusion</a>
 and we also considered a few instances where interacting with an 
illusion isn't strictly necessary to disbelieve the illusion. This week,
 we'll wrap up our study of illusions with a few odds and ends related 
to the topic.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Figments Well</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, spellcasters often make the mistake of trying to use <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_figmentsubschool')">figment</a> spells (such as <i>silent image, minor image,</i> and <i>major image</i>) to make something look like something else. Figment spells don't do that -- you need a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_glamersubschool')">glamer</a> spell for the task. You can craft a figment to fit in with its surroundings or to conceal something. Consider these situations:</p>
<ul>
<li> A party wishes to hide in a dungeon room just beyond an archway.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You cannot use a figment to make the archway look like 
an unbroken wall. You can, however, use a figment to make the archway 
look like it has been bricked up; the edges of the bricked area will 
conform to the archway. You also could use a figment to create an 
illusory door that fills the doorway. You could even include hinges for 
the door (set atop the frame of the arch) and a big lock.</p>
<ul>
<li> You wish to draw some bad guys into an ambush by creating a false oasis in the desert.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You cannot use a figment to make empty sand look like an
 oasis. You still can create an illusory oasis with one or more figment 
effects. You can create an illusory pool of water to fill a depression 
in the sand, and you can sprinkle the area with illusory palm trees and 
undergrowth.</p>
<p align="left">If the area is very flat, you won't be able to create a 
believable figment pool of water, but you might get away with a spring 
where water bubbles to the surface and soaks back into the sand.</p>
<ul>
<li> A party caught in the open wants to hide from an airborne foe.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">A figment can't make the party look like they aren't 
there. It can, however, make them a place to hide. You could use a 
figment spell to make an illusory house, a grove of trees (with leafy 
branches for concealment), or even a hill or big rock. The party will be
 concealed so long as the characters stay underneath the illusion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>A Few Additional Notes on Figments</b></p>
<p align="left">The foregoing examples also serve to illustrate concepts from Parts Two and Three:</p>
<p align="left">Characters hiding behind or under the illusions here need to make <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throws</a>
 to successfully disbelieve them (assuming they want to do so). The 
caster, however, knows the illusions aren't real. If the caster points 
out the illusions, the characters get a +4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> on their saves; in this case, the DM might want to waive the saving throws and assume disbelief to save time.</p>
<p align="left">In any case, a successful saving throw against a figment
 spell reveals the figment to be unreal, but still visible (if it's a 
visible figment) as a see-through outline. This is helpful to characters
 using a figment for concealment because they can see right through the 
figment and also know exactly where the figment is so that they can 
remain concealed.</p>
<p align="left">In many cases, creatures who are unaware that illusion 
magic is at work probably will not gain saving throws to disbelieve the 
figments in these examples. A creature in the vicinity of one of these 
figments probably would pass right by without taking any action to study
 or interact with the figment and gain a saving throw. This, however, 
applies only to creatures passing casually though the area. A creature 
that is deliberately searching for the party that the figments in these 
examples conceal probably will poke around long enough to gain a saving 
throw through study or interaction (or might simply stumble through the 
figment). Likewise, a creature that is very familiar with the locale 
where the figments have been placed probably will note the sudden 
appearance of a new feature and gain an immediate saving throw (because 
doors, oases, and hills don't just spring up in a matter of minutes or 
hours usually).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Illusions and Mindless Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">Unraveling an illusion is partly a matter of intellect, 
but mostly a matter of analysis and perception. Any creature can attempt
 to disbelieve an illusion because every creature has a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Wisdom')">Wisdom</a>
 score. A mindless creature, however, is much less likely to find 
something just plainly unbelievable (and thus gain a saving throw to 
disbelieve with no study or interaction) than a creature with an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a>
 score would be. A mindless creature lacks an internal catalog of 
memories and expectations that can generate the level of incredulity 
required to evoke instant disbelief.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Illusions and Objects </b></p>
<p align="left">Objects have no senses and no Wisdom scores. They cannot disbelieve an illusion, but they can't perceive it either.</p>
<p align="left">Shadows are a special case. A shadow is partly real and can affect an object just as anything real can. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_shadowsubschool')">Shadow</a>
 spells that have a reduced effect when disbelieved generally have 
reduced effects against objects because objects can't believe them. 
Check the description of the shadow spell in question to be sure. For 
example, objects automatically are assumed to make their saving throws 
against the various shadow conjuration and shadow evocation spells 
presented in the <i>Player's Handbook. </i>In other cases, follow the 
rules for object saving throws against spells (in most cases an 
unattended, nonmagical object doesn't get a saving throw against a 
spell).</p>
<p align="left"><b>More Fun With Shadows</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-28%20-%20All%20About%20Illusions%20%28Part%204%29_files/dx0207rg_rulesgame_shadow2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="184" width="270">In
 most cases, what applies to a figment spell also applies to a shadow 
spell, with one important exception: A shadow is partially real. A 
shadow can have real effects, even when a subject disbelieves the 
shadow.</p>
<p align="left">A shadow's quasi-real nature can pose some problems in play. Here are a few tips and reminders for handling shadows:</p>
<ul>
<li> A shadow is only partially real whether a subject believes it is 
real or not. A shadow's degree of reality is expressed as a percentage 
given in the spell description. For example, a creature conjured with a <i>shadow conjuration</i> spell is only 20% real.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Certain aspects of a shadow always depend on its degree of reality. These aspects include <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Other aspects of a shadow remain fixed, no matter what 
its degree of reality. These include gross dimensions (height, width, 
thickness), superficial details (color, shape, anatomical features), <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a> bonus (but see below), saving throw bonuses, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skill')">skill</a> scores, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilityscore')">ability scores</a>. For example, a shadow ogre mage (page 200 in the <i>Monster Manual</i>) that is 20% real has 5 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDice')">Hit Dice</a>, but only 7 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a> (20% of 37, rounded down to the nearest whole number). Its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a> ratings are unchanged. Its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>
 depends on whether its attacker believes it is real. The rest of the 
monster's statistics are unchanged, though some of its combat results 
will be reduced against foes who have successfully disbelieved it. </p>
<ul>
<li> When a creature believes a shadow is real, the shadow interacts 
with that creature exactly like the real creature or object it depicts, 
except as noted previously.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">A shadow creature strikes in combat for full damage if 
the other creature believes it is real. It likewise has its full Armor 
Class bonus if the creature attacking it believes it is real. 
Nevertheless, the shadow has only part of its real counterpart's hit 
points.</p>
<p align="left">When a creature successfully disbelieves a shadow, the shadow has a partially real effect when interacting with that creature.</p>
<p align="left">When dealing with a partially real effect from a shadow,
 first attempt to reduce the effect according to the shadow's degree of 
reality. If the aspect can be expressed as a number, you simply reduce 
it accordingly. Be sure, however, that you apply the reduction only once
 to any particular number. For instance the shadow ogre mage from the 
previous example normally strikes with its greatsword for 3d6+7 points 
of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>.
 Against a foe who has successfully disbelieved it, the shadow ogre mage
 uses its normal attack bonus of +7, but deals only 20% of its usual 
damage with a successful hit. Roll damage normally, but apply only 20% 
of the resulting damage. For example, the shadow ogre mage hits and 
rolls 3d6+7 points of damage for a total of 19 points. It deals only 3 
points (20% of 19, rounded down to the nearest whole number). When the 
disbelieving foe attacks the shadow ogre mage, its Armor Class is 
calculated as follows: base 10 (unchanged), -1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a> (unchanged), +1 additional bonus (+5 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalarmorbonus')">natural</a>,
 +4 chain shirt; that is an unadjusted total +9; 20% of that is 1.8, 
rounded down to the nearest whole number). The disbelieving foe has to 
contend with AC 11, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_touchattack')">touch</a> 9, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flatfooted')">flat-footed</a> 11. If the shadow ogre mage had a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> bonus, that, too, would be added into the pool of AC bonuses that would be reduced.</p>
<p align="left">The shadow ogre mage still occupies 10 feet of space on the battlefield, and it has a reach of 10 feet. It conducts combat as a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Large')">Large</a> creature.</p>
<p align="left">You might wonder why the size modifier wasn't altered 
for the shadow ogre mage's Armor Class. The shadow ogre mage is still 
tall and broad enough to present a big target, so size still has its 
full effect (as it would if the shadow combatant were small enough to 
gain an Armor Class bonus).</p>
<p align="left">Being only part real cannot make a creature a more 
capable foe. Do not reduce Dexterity penalties when calculating a 
shadow's Armor Class.</p>
<p align="left">The shadow ogre mage has its full suite of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spelllikeability')">spell-like abilities</a>. Its damage-dealing ability, <i>cone of cold, </i>works normally against a disbeliever, except that the damage dealt is only 20% of normal. Its other abilities (<i>darkness, invisibility, charm person,</i>
 flight, and regeneration) aren't so easy to handle. I recommend that 
any ability that affects only the shadow creature work normally (in this
 case, <i>invisibility ,</i> flight, and regeneration). Powers that can affect others or the creature's surroundings (<i>darkness </i>and <i>charm person</i>) have only a 20% chance to work when the<i></i>shadow
 ogre mage uses them. Roll percentile dice, and on a roll of 81 or 
higher, the power in question has its full effect. Otherwise, it has no 
effects at all.</p>
<p align="left">You can use this method to deal with any ability a 
shadow creature has. First look to a numerical damage value or AC bonus 
you can reduce. If there is none, roll to determine if the ability takes
 effect.</p>
<p align="left"><b>In Conclusion </b></p>
