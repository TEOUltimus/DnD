<p align="left">Whether your roleplaying style leans toward kicking in 
doors and hacking up everything that moves or more toward detailed 
storytelling, chances are you expect your character to do a few things 
every adventure. Fortunately, the <b>D&amp;D</b> game has plenty of 
rules governing how characters act. At the core of those rules lies the 
game's system of actions. When you understand the terminology and basic 
rules governing actions, you can avoid many errors and misunderstandings
 -- and head off many arguments.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Language of Actions </b></p>
<p align="left">Here are a few terms you'll encounter in this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
 PH pg 304: "Action: A character activity. Actions are divided into the 
following categories, according to the time required to perform them 
(from most time to least): full-round actions, standard actions, move 
actions, and free actions." </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><b>Action:</b> The <i>Player's Handbook</i> glossary 
defines an action as a character activity, which doesn't tell the whole 
story. In practical terms, an action is something you do during your own
 turn that uses up time (usually) and changes (or has the potential to 
change) something in the game world. As a general rule, you can use an 
action only during your own turn. You sometimes can <i>act</i> during 
someone else's turn, but when you do so that's usually an extra activity
 for you, and it doesn't affect the actions available to you during your
 next turn.<br><br> The basic kinds of actions in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game include standard actions, move actions, full-round actions, free actions, and nonactions.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Free Action:</b> A free action is an activity that takes only a 
minor amount of time. You can take any number of free actions during 
your turn, subject to your DM's approval. Taking one or more free 
actions doesn't affect the other actions available to you during your 
turn.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Full-Round Action:</b> A full-round action is an activity that 
effectively consumes all of your time during your turn. Consequently, 
you cannot use either a standard or a move action (see below) during a 
turn when you use a full-round action. You can, however, use a 5-foot 
step during a turn when you use a full-round action (see the nonaction 
entry). You also can use free actions during a turn when you use a 
full-round action.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Move Action:</b> A move action is an activity that allows you to 
move your speed across the battlefield or perform some other activity 
that takes a similar amount of time. You're allowed one move action 
during your turn. You can take a second move action during your turn in 
place of the standard action you're also allowed (see below). You 
cannot, however, take a second standard action in place of a move 
action.<br><br></li>
<li>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
 PH pg 139: "Not an Action: Some activities are so minor that they are 
not even considered free actions. They literally don't take any time at 
all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing something else. 
For instance, using the Use Magic Device skill (page 85) while trying to
 activate a device is not an action, it is part of the standard action 
to activate a magic item." </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table><b>Nonaction:</b> A nonaction is an activity that 
effectively takes no time at all (as opposed to a free action, which 
takes an insignificant amount of time), but it nevertheless involves 
some effort on your part. Often, a nonaction is something that you do as
 part of another action, such as making a Use Magic Device skill check 
while trying to activate a magic wand. Activating the wand is a standard
 action and making the check is not an action at all. Some activities 
that are described in the rules as free actions are actually nonactions;
 one example is trying to establish a hold on a foe after a successful 
grab in a grapple attack. (Readers may remember the entry for "Not an 
Action" on page 139 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.) <br><br> A 5-foot step is a nonaction you can use to move a short distance when you don't otherwise move during your turn; see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i>.<br><br>
 Many nonactions are things you can do when it's not your turn, such as 
making opposed checks to avoid being disarmed or tripped or making an 
attack of opportunity.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Standard Action:</b> A standard action is a kind of action that 
covers any activity you can perform and still have time left to move 
your speed during the same turn (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i>). You are allowed only one standard action each turn, and sometimes you can't perform any standard actions at all.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b> Using Actions </b></p>
<p align="left"> In most cases, you have the following three options available to you during your turn (choose one):</p>
<ul>
<li> One standard action plus one move action.</li>
<li>Two move actions.</li>
<li>One full-round action.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You can add any number of nonactions or a reasonable 
number of free actions (your DM decides what's reasonable) to the option
 you choose. Some of these extras impose their own limits on what you 
can do; for example, you can take only one 5-foot step during your turn.
 Various expansions to the <b>D&amp;D</b> rules introduce more ways to 
sneak in little extras while you act during your turn. An example is the
 immediate action from the <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i>. We'll take a look at those in Part Two.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot combine your action options. For example, if 
you use the Multi-Shot feat, which allows you to fire multiple arrows as
 a standard action, you cannot also use the full attack action, which is
 a full-round action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Action Restrictions </b></p>
<p align="left">
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
 PH pg 137: "The Surprise Round: If some but not all of the combatants 
are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular 
rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can act in the 
surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative order 
(highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their 
opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round (see 
Standard Actions, page 139). You can also take free actions during the 
surprise round, at the DM's discretion. If no one or everyone is 
surprised, no surprise round occurs." </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>Circumstances often reduce your options for acting. 
Sometimes, you simply don't have a complete round in which to act. Other
 times, you find yourself unable to act quickly or decisively.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Surprise Rounds: </b>Whenever some combatants in a 
battle are aware of their opponents and some are not, the battle begins 
with a surprise round (see page 137 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). 
Combatants who begin the combat aware of the opposition can act during a
 surprise round, but can use only a standard action during their turns 
(plus any free actions the DM allows and nonactions as appropriate). 
Remember that when you have a standard action available, you can use a 
move action instead (but not vice versa).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Character Conditions </b></p>
<p align="left">Many conditions also restrict the actions you can perform. See page 300 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for a complete list of character conditions. </p>

</tr>
</tbody></table><b>Ability Damaged or Drained:</b> You become unable to 
act when any ability score is reduced to 0. When your Constitution score
 falls to 0 you die (see dead below). When your Strength score falls to 0
 you collapse, limp as a rag doll. When your Dexterity falls to 0, 
you're paralyzed, unable to move a muscle. These latter two situations 
generally rule out any action or nonaction unless you have a way to 
affect yourself or your surroundings purely through mental activity. For
 example, moving with a <i>fly</i> or <i>levitate</i> spell doesn't 
require any physical activity, and either spell would allow you to use a
 move action to move at the speed the spell in question allows. 
Likewise, a <i>mage hand</i> or <i>telekinesis</i> spell would allow 
some move actions (such as picking up an item), some standard actions 
(such as lighting a torch with a tindertwig), or some full-round actions
 (such as lighting a torch with flint and steel). Some actions, such as 
concentrating to maintain an active spell, also are purely mental.</p>
<p align="left">You can use free actions and nonactions while your 
Dexterity or Strength score is reduced to 0, provided such actions are 
purely mental.</p>
<p align="left">It's reasonable for a DM to limit exactly what you can 
accomplish when your Strength or Dexterity is reduced to 0. After all, 
your field of vision and other faculties are likely to be restricted.</p>
<p align="left">When your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma falls to 0, 
parts of your brain shuts down and you lose consciousness. While 
unconscious, you cannot act at all.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cowering: </b>You cannot act when cowering.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dazed: </b>You cannot act when dazed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dead:</b> When you're dead, your spirit departs and 
your body becomes a mere object. Neither your departed spirit nor your 
lifeless body can act. Of course, either your spirit or your body may 
regain some semblance of life, such as becoming an undead creature, but 
then you're no longer truly dead.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Disabled: </b>You're limited to one move action or 
one standard action (you can't use both) when disabled. You cannot use a
 full-round action when disabled. If you use a standard action (or 
anything strenuous) while disabled, you take 1 point of damage after 
completing the action. See Part Two for more notes on the disabled 
condition.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dying: </b>When you're dying, you're unconscious and unable to act; see the notes under ability damage and ability drain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fascinated: </b>When fascinated, you must stand or 
sit quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the source
 of your fascination. In effect, you use a standard action during your 
turn to focus on the source of your fascination, and you cannot move, or
 even take a 5-foot step, while fascinated.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fatigued:</b> When fatigued, you can neither run nor charge, but your actions aren't otherwise restricted.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightened:</b> If you're frightened, you must use 
two move actions each round to flee from the source of your fright. If 
unable to flee, you can fight; you take a -2 penalty on all attack 
rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.</p>

who started the grapple), you can perform any of the following actions. 
Some of these actions take the place of an attack (rather than being a 
standard action or a move action). If your base attack bonus allows you 
multiple attacks, you can attempt one of these actions in place of each 
of your attacks, but at successfully lower base attack bonuses: activate
 a magic item, attack your opponent, cast a spell, damage your opponent,
 draw a light weapon, escape from grapple, move, retrieve a spell 
component, pin your opponent, break another's pin, use opponent's 
weapon." </td>

<p align="left"><b>Grappling:</b> When engaged in a grapple (either 
holding onto a foe or in a foe's grasp) you can undertake only a limited
 number of actions, as noted on page 156 of the <i>Player's Handbook. </i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Helpless:</b> You cannot act when helpless.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nauseated:</b> When nauseated, you're limited to a single move action during your turn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Panicked:</b> If you're panicked, you must use two

grapple check in place of an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check

grappling.."</p>

<p align="left"><b>Pinned:</b> Being pinned is just like being held in a grapple, except you have even fewer options. See page 156 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details<i>.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Prone:</b> You cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow) when prone. You actions aren't otherwise limited.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stable:</b> When you're stable you're also unconscious; see the notes under ability damage and ability drain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Staggered:</b> When staggered, you can use a single 
move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can you use
 a full-round action).</p>
