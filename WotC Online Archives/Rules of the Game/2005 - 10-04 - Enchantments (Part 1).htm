<p align="left">The ability to magically force others to do your bidding
 is one of the more exciting -- and terrifying -- aspects of magic. In 
the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> of the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_enchantment')">enchantment</a>
 school provide the primary means of controlling others. Enchantment 
spells can prove extremely powerful in play because of their potential 
to immediately remove a foe from a combat or even turn it against its 
allies. This short series takes a quick look at enchantments and offers 
some tips for handling the more troublesome spells in the school.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Language of Enchantments</b></p>

<p align="left"><b>Enchantment</b></p>
<p align="left">Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Representative spells include <i>charm person</i> and <i>suggestion. </i>All enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two types of enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Charm:</b> A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compulsion:</b> A compulsion spell forces the subject
 to act in some manner or changes the way her mind works. Some 
compulsion spells determine the subject's actions or the effects on the 
subject, some compulsion spells allow you to determine the subject's 
actions when you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control 
over the subject.</p>

<p align="left">Here are a few terms you'll encounter in this article.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_charmsubschool')">Charm</a> Spell:</b>
 One of two subschools of the enchantment school. A charm spell changes 
the subject's perception so that the subject thinks of the spell's 
caster (or possibly some other <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creature</a>
 the caster designates) as a valued friend or ally. A charm spell 
differs from a compulsion spell in that it does not force the subject to
 do anything. Instead, the spell prompts a change in thinking in the 
subject that in turn affects how the subject behaves.</p>
<p align="left"><b><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_compulsionsubschool')">Compulsion</a> Spell:</b>
 One of the two subschools of the enchantment school. A compulsion spell
 forces the subject to act as the spell's caster dictates. Some 
compulsion spells short circuit the subject's mind and prevent the 
subject from acting. Other compulsions force a limited set of 
instructions in the subject's mind and the subject then follows those 
instructions to the best of its ability. Still other compulsions allow 
the user to seize control over the subject's mind and consequently 
dictate the subject's actions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Enchantment:</b> One of the eight schools of magic in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game. As Rules of the Game pointed out in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Reading Spell Descriptions</a>, "enchantment" has a fairly restricted meaning in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game. Fantasy literature often uses the term "enchantment" as a catchall for any magical effect. In the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, however, enchantment spells affect the mind and cause the 
recipient to think and act in ways that the subject would not do 
otherwise. Spells from this school always have the mind-affecting 
descriptor. Consequently, enchantment spells affect only creatures (and 
not all creatures).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Language-Dependent:</b> A spell descriptor (see <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Reading Spell Descriptions</a>)
 indicating a spell that depends on some kind of intelligible speech 
between the spell caster and the subject. That is, the caster must speak
 to the recipient in a language that the recipient understands. One 
could use a magical means, such as the <i>tongues</i> spell, to provide the necessary means of communication.</p>
<p align="left">You can use some means of nonverbal "speech" (such as a <i>helm of telepathy</i>) when verbal communications aren't possible or desirable.</p>
<p align="left">Many enchantment spells have the language-dependent 
descriptor, but not all of them do. Even when an enchantment spell does 
not have the language-dependent descriptor, a subject cannot obey a 
spellcaster's orders unless the caster finds some way to communicate 
with the subject (see the discussion of the <i>charm person</i> spell in Part Two for an example).</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the Sense Motive skill description on page 81 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>SENSE MOTIVE (WIS)</b></p>
<p align="left">Use this skill to tell when someone is bluffing you, to 
discern hidden messages in conversations, or to sense when someone is 
being magically influenced. This skill represents sensitivity to the 
body language, speech habits, and mannerisms of others.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Check:</b> A successful check lets you avoid being 
bluffed (see the Bluff skill, page 67). You can also use this skill to 
determine when "something is up" (that is, something odd is going on) or
 to assess someone's trustworthiness. Your DM may decide to make your 
Sense Motive check secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether 
you were successful.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Task Sense Motive DC</b></p>
<p align="left">Hunch 20<br> Sense enchantment 25 or 15<br> Discern secret message Varies</p>
<p align="left"><i>Sense Enchantment:</i> You can tell that someone's 
behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition, a 
mind-affecting effect), such as <i>charm person,</i> even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see <i>dominate person</i> in Chapter 11: Spells), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Action:</b> Trying to gain information with Sense 
Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole 
evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Try Again: </b>No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special:</b> A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy (see page 47).</p>
<p align="left">If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Synergy:</b> If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Mind-Affecting:</b> A spell descriptor (see <i>Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</i>)
 indicating a spell that alters the subject's thoughts, emotions, and 
perceptions. In the latter case, the subject's senses aren't affected, 
but the subject's mental responses to her senses are changed.</p>
<p align="left">Mind-affecting effects include charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, fear effects, and morale effects.</p>
<p align="left">Mind-affecting spells don't work on creatures that lack <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a> scores (such creatures literally do not have minds), nor do they affect constructs, oozes, plants, undead, and vermin.</p>
<p align="left">If a mind-affecting special attack from a creature also 
has the sonic descriptor, you can become immune to the attack by 
stopping your ears, but only if you do so before you're subjected to the
 attack (see page 314 in the <i>Monster Manual</i>). As noted in the glossary entry (see the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_sonicattack')">sonic attack</a> entry for more information), stopping one's ears ahead of time allows opponents to avoid having to make <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throws</a> against mind-affecting sonic attacks, but not other kinds of sonic attacks (such as those that deal damage).</p>

 You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against
 the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the 
object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's 
caster level.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, all enchantment spells are 
mind-affecting spells. Enchantments don't work on mindless creatures, 
nor do they work on certain other kinds of creatures, such as undead 
(see the previous section). A few other basics follow:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Detecting Enchantments</b></p>
<p align="left">When you suspect that an ally has been enchanted, you can confirm your suspicion using the <i>detect magic</i> spell or the Sense Motive skill on page 81 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i></p>
<p align="left">Anyone who has received an enchantment spell has an aura of enchantment magic that a <i>detect magic</i> spell can detect. The aura's power depends on the spell level, as shown in the <i>detect magic</i>
 spell description. If the subject has received multiple spells, 
stronger auras might mask weaker ones, making it more difficult or 
impossible to identify the enchantment aura, also as noted in the spell 
description.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="290"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the <i>binding</i> spell text on page 205 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left">You can't dispel a <i>binding </i>spell with <i>dispel magic </i>or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field </i>or <i>Mordenkainen's disjunction </i>affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to <i>dismissal, banishment, </i>or a similar effect.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">An enchanted creature does not act entirely under its 
own volition, and its speech, movements, posture, and expressions can 
betray the enchantment to a careful observer. If you study or interact 
with a subject for 1 minute, you can make a Sense Motive check to 
determine if the subject is enchanted. The task isn't easy, and the 
usual Sense Motive <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyCheck')">DC</a> for noting an enchantment is 25. A domination effect (such as <i>dominate person</i> or <i>dominate monster</i>) brings the subject under such firm control that the DC to note the enchantment is only 15. The rules don't say so, but <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DMs</a> should feel free to allow a Sense Motive <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> of +2 to +4 when the character using the skill knows the subject well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Negating Enchantments</b></p>
<p align="left">Characters who receive enchantment spells tend to 
attract additional spells as the subject's allies try to intervene and 
get the character acting normally again.</p>
<p align="left">The tried and true <i>dispel magic</i> spell can end most enchantments; a few, such as <i>binding</i>, aren't subject to dispelling, so always check the spell description to learn if a spell cannot be dispelled. You can cast <i>dispel magic</i>
 several different ways. When trying to remove an unwanted enchantment 
from an ally, a targeted dispel usually is the best bet. See the spell 
description and <i>Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/rg">More Magical Oddities</a></i> for details.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="290"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the <i>dispel evil</i> spell text on page 222 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left">Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. <i>Exception: </i>Spells that can't be dispelled by <i>dispel magic </i>also can't be dispelled by <i>dispel evil</i>. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">You can use <i>dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel good,</i> or <i>dispel law</i>
 to remove one enchantment spell from a creature you touch. The spell 
you remove must have been cast by a character with the appropriate <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_alignment')">alignment</a>. For example, a <i>dispel chaos</i>
 spell removes enchantments that a chaotic character has cast. No roll 
is required to dispel the enchantment; you need only touch the creature 
that has received the enchantment.</p>
<p align="left">Removing an enchantment discharges and ends the <i>dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel good,</i> or <i>dispel law</i>
 spell, as noted in the spell description. The rules don't say what 
happens when the creature you touch has received more than one 
enchantment. The DM can allow the <i>dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel good,</i> or <i>dispel law</i> user to specify the spell to be removed (see <i>Rules of the Game: More Magical Oddities</i>
 for some suggestions about how a character might do that). Or, you can 
assume the spell removes the highest level enchantment (that is subject 
to dispelling) that the subject has received.</p>
<p align="left">Many enchantment spells allow the subject a chance to 
throw off the spell when ordered to do something contrary to its 
interests or nature. Exactly what sort of orders prompt a new saving 
throw vary with the spell and are noted in the spell description. Not 
all enchantments allow new saving throws.</p>
<p align="left">When a subject gains a new saving throw, the effects of a
 successful save usually negate the spell (at least for that recipient).
 Check the saving throw entry in the spell description for the effects 
of any successful saving throw against the spell.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the Aiming a Spell section on page 175 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Target or Targets: </b>Some spells, such as <i>charm person, </i>have
 a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures or objects, as 
defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch the 
target, and you must specifically choose that target. For example, you 
can't fire a <i>magic missile </i>spell (which always hits its target) 
into a group of bandits with the instruction to strike "the leader." To 
strike the leader, you must be able to identify and see the leader (or 
guess which is the leader and get lucky). However, you do not have to 
select your target until you finish casting the spell.</p>
<p align="left">If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell 
description has a line that reads Target: You), you do not receive a 
saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply. The Saving Throw and 
Spell Resistance lines are omitted from such spells.</p>
<p align="left">Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. 
Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at 
any time (even if you're flat-footed or it isn't your turn). Unconscious
 creatures are automatically considered willing, but a character who is 
conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound, cowering, 
grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing. 
Some spells, such as <i>flaming sphere </i>and <i>spiritual weapon, </i>allow
 you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the 
spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action that does not provoke 
attacks of opportunity.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Aiming Enchantments</b></p>
<p align="left">Most (but not all) enchantment spells have target 
entries. That means the caster must see or touch the recipient to aim 
the spell. See <i>Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</i> for 
details. If the spell affects multiple targets, the caster must be able 
to see or touch all of them to affect them with the spell.</p>
<p align="left">When an enchantment doesn't have a target entry, you 
usually don't have to see or touch the recipient. Instead, you can aim 
the spell at some location you can see or specify; see Aiming a Spell on
 page 175 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and <i>Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</i> for details.</p>

<p align="left">When an enchantment spell (or any spell) has a target 
entry, you usually know when the spell works and when it does not. When 
an enchantment's target fails a saving throw against a spell, you may 
know promptly that the spell worked because the target's behavior may 
change abruptly. However, trying to feign being enchanted by a targeted 
spell after a successful save does not work because the caster will note
 the successful saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">When an enchantment spell (or any spell) has an area or 
effect entry, the caster does not note successful saves against the 
spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stacking Enchantment Spells</b></p>
<p align="left">When a creature receives more than one enchantment spell, refer to the rules on pages 171-172 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 As a rule of thumb, all enchantment spells a creature receives continue
 to function when the creature receives additional enchantment spells. 
The spells' effects might stack, overlap, or override each other, as 
noted below:</p>

<p align="left">Spells or magical effects usually work as described, no 
matter how many other spells or magical effects happen to be operating 
in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a 
spell does not affect the way another spell operates. Whenever a spell 
has a specific effect on other spells, the spell description explains 
that effect. Several other general rules apply when spells or magical 
effects operate in the same place:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stacking Effects:</b> Spells that provide bonuses or 
penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other 
attributes usually do not stack with themselves. For example, two <i>bless </i>spells don't give twice the benefit of one <i>bless</i>. Both <i>bless </i>spells,
 however, continue to act simultaneously, and if one ends first, the 
other one continues to operate for the remainder of its duration. 
Likewise, two <i>haste </i>spells do not make a creature doubly fast. 
More generally, two bonuses of the same type don't stack even if they 
come from different spells (or from effects other than spells; see Bonus
 Types, above). For example, the enhancement bonus to Strength from a <i>bull's strength </i>spell and the enhancement bonus to Strength from a <i>divine power </i>spell don't stack. You use whichever bonus gives you the better Strength score. In the same way, a <i>belt of giant Strength </i>gives you an enhancement bonus to Strength, which does not stack with the bonus you get from a <i>bull's strength </i>spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Different Bonus Names: </i>The bonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the modifiers are of different types. For example, <i>bless </i>provides a +1 morale bonus on saves against fear effects, and <i>protection from evil </i>provides
 a +2 resistance bonus on saves against spells cast by evil creatures. A
 character under the influence of spells gets a +1 bonus against fear 
effects, a +2 bonus against spells cast by evil beings, and a +3 bonus 
against <i>fear </i>spells cast by evil creatures.</p>
<p align="left">A bonus that isn't named (just a "+2 bonus" rather than a "+2 resistance bonus") stacks with any bonus.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: </i>In
 cases when two or more identical spells are operating in the same area 
or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one 
applies. For example, if a character takes a -4 penalty to Strength from
 a <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>spell and then receives a second <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>spell
 that applies a -6 penalty, he or she takes only the -6 penalty. Both 
spells are still operating on the character, however. If one <i>ray of enfeeblement </i>spell is dispelled or its duration runs out, the other spell remains in effect, assuming that its duration has not yet expired.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Same Effect with Differing Results: </i>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. For example, a series of <i>polymorph </i>spells
 might turn a creature into a mouse, a lion, and then a snail. In this 
case, the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the 
previous spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects 
become irrelevant while the final spell in the series lasts.</p>
<p align="left"><i>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </i>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. For example, if a wizard is using a <i>shapechange </i>spell to take the shape of an eagle, a <i>polymorph </i>spell could change her into a goldfish. The <i>shapechange </i>spell is not negated, however, and since the <i>polymorph </i>spell has no effect on the recipient's special abilities, the wizard could use the <i>shapechange </i>effect to take any form the spell allows whenever she desires. If a creature using a <i>shapechange </i>effect becomes petrified by a <i>flesh to stone </i>spell, however, it turns into a mindless, inert statue, and the <i>shapechange </i>effect cannot help it escape.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Multiple Mental Control Effects: </i>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each other irrelevant. For example, a <i>hold person </i>effect
 renders any other form of mental control irrelevant because it robs the
 subject of the ability to move. Mental controls that don't remove the 
recipient's ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. For
 example, a person who has received a <i>geas/quest </i>spell can also be subjected to a <i>charm person </i>spell. The <i>charmed </i>person
 remains committed to fulfilling the quest, however, and resists any 
order that interferes with that goal. In this case, the <i>geas/quest </i>spell doesn't negate <i>charm person, </i>but
 it does reduce its effectiveness, just as nonmagical devotion to a 
quest would. If a creature is under the mental control of two or more 
creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the 
extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature 
receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers 
must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature 
obeys.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spells with Opposite Effects:</b> Spells with 
opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes
 accruing in the order that they apply. Some spells negate or counter 
each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a spell's 
description.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Instantaneous Effects:</b> Two or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same target. For example, when two <i>fireballs </i>strike a same creature, the target must attempt a saving throw against each <i>fireball </i>and takes damage from each according to the saving throws' results. If a creature receives two <i>cure light wounds </i>spells in a single round, both work normally.</p>

<p align="left">&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Enchantments That Provide Bonuses:</b><i></i>When any
 spell produces a bonus with a name, that bonus usually doesn't stack 
with bonuses that have the same name (see page 21 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> and <i>Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040120a">Does it Stack</a>?</i>), so the two effects overlap. For example, the +1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moralebonus')">morale bonus</a> on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack rolls</a> and saves against <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_feareffect')">fear effects</a> from an <i>aid</i> spell won't stack with the +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects from a <i>bless</i> spell. The <i>aid</i> and <i>bless</i> spells don't negate each other, however. If the <i>aid</i> spell lasts longer that the <i>bless</i> spell (or vice versa), the target still gets the benefits of the remaining spell.</p>
<p align="left">When two or more spells provide bonuses with different 
names, their effects stack. For example, the +1 morale bonus on attack 
rolls and saves against fear effects from an <i>aid</i> spell stacks with the +1 luck bonus on attack rolls and all saves from a <i>prayer</i> spell. <i>Prayer's</i>
 luck bonus applies to more than just attack rolls and saves (see the 
spell description), but only the portion of the spell that stacks with <i>aid</i> concerns us here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Enchantments That Render Other Enchantments Irrelevant: </b>In many cases, one enchantment spell renders another spell irrelevant. For example, a <i>hold person</i>
 spell effectively paralyzes the target, rendering just about every 
other enchantment spell the target might receive (either before or after
 the <i>hold person</i> spell) irrelevant while the <i>hold person</i> lasts. For example, you might use a spell such as <i>charm person, suggestion, confusion,</i> or <i>dominate person</i> spell to control or influence a creature's actions. A creature that also receives a <i>hold person</i> spell freezes in place, making that creature unable to act as the <i>charm person, suggestion, confusion,</i> or <i>dominate person</i> spell dictates (or allows the caster to dictate) while the <i>hold person</i> lasts.</p>
<p align="left">When one enchantment spell makes another enchantment 
spell (or any other spell) irrelevant, the irrelevant spell does not 
end. When the overriding spell ends, any spells it has rendered 
irrelevant reassert themselves if their durations haven't expired.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Multiple Enchantments That Provide Control:</b> Two 
enchantments that don't remove the recipient's ability to act usually do
 not interfere with each other. If a creature has received enchantments 
that make it obey orders from two or more creatures, it tends to obey 
each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each 
enchantment allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting 
orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Charisma')">Charisma</a> checks to determine which one the creature obeys. Making the opposed check isn't an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a> for either caster.</p>
<p align="left">For example, a creature receives a <i>dominate person</i> spell from one caster and a<i> charm person</i>
 spell from another. Both spells work, and the creature must obey both 
casters. If the creature simultaneously receives orders and cannot obey 
both casters (for example, when the casters each orders the subject to 
approach a different location), the casters make opposed Charisma checks
 and the subject obeys the caster who wins the check. See Part Two for 
additional notes on <i>charm person </i>and <i>dominate person.</i></p>
<p align="left">This rule applies only when a creature receives 
simultaneous orders, or orders that override each other. If only one 
caster gives orders, the subject obeys that caster.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That pretty well covers the basics of enchantment 
spells. Next week, we'll look at a few specific enchantment spells and 
see how the basics affect play.</p>
