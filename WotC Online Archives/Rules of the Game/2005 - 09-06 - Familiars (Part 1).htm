<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Familiar Basics </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The sidebar on pages 52-54 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 details a familiar's abilities and the advantages it brings to the 
master. Here's an overview, along with a few comments and 
clarifications. All the following traits and features apply to a 
familiar for as long as it remains a familiar -- that is, for as long as
 the familiar and the master are both alive and the master has not 
chosen to dismiss the familiar.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>FAMILIARS</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Familiars are magically linked to their masters. In some
 sense, the familiar and the master are practically one being. That's 
why, for example, the master can cast a personal range spell on a 
familiar even though he can normally cast such a spell only on himself. A
 familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical
 beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the 
appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and 
feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical 
beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on
 its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. Thus,
 a druid/sorcerer can't use her animal companion as a familiar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A familiar also grants special abilities to its master 
(a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special 
abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of 
each other.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Levels of different classes that are entitled to 
familiars (such as sorcerer and wizard) stack for the purpose of 
determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Familiar Basics: </b>Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, as given in the <i>Monster Manual</i>, but make the following changes:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Hit Dice: </i>For the purpose of effects related to 
number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's 
normal HD total, whichever is higher.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Hit Points: </i>The familiar has one-half the 
master's total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded 
down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice. For example, at 2nd level, 
Hennet has 9 hit points, so his familiar has 4.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Attacks: </i>Use the master's base attack bonus, as 
calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's Dexterity or 
Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar's melee 
attack bonus with natural weapons. Damage equals that of a normal 
creature of the familiar's kind.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Saving Throws: </i>For each saving throw, use either 
the familiar's base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the
 master's (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The
 familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share 
any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves (from magic
 items or feats, for example).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills: </i>For each skill in which either the master
 or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an 
animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever are better. 
In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless 
of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills (such as Craft) may 
remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Familiar Ability Descriptions: </b>All familiars have
 special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on 
the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on
 the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Natural Armor Adj.: </i>The number noted here is an 
improvement to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus. It 
represents the preternatural toughness of a spellcaster's familiar. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Int: </i>The familiar's Intelligence score. Familiars are as smart as people, though not necessarily as smart as smart people.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Alertness (Ex): </i>The presence of the familiar 
sharpens its master's senses. While a familiar is within arm's reach, 
the master gains the Alertness feat (page 89).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Improved Evasion (Ex): </i>When subjected to an 
attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a 
familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half 
damage even if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Share Spells: </i>At the master's option, he may have
 any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also 
affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of 
casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration 
other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves 
farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if 
it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the 
master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on his familiar (as a 
touch range spell) instead of on himself. A master and his familiar can 
share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the 
familiar's type (magical beast).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Empathic Link (Su): </i>The master has an empathic 
link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master 
cannot see through the familiar's eyes, but they can communicate 
empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general 
emotional content (such as fear, hunger, happiness, curiosity) can be 
communicated. Note that the low Intelligence of a low-level master's 
familiar limits what the creature is able to communicate or understand, 
and even intelligent familiars see the world differently from humans, so
 misunderstandings are always possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because of this empathic link, the master has the same 
connection to an item or place that his familiar does. For instance, if 
his familiar has seen a room, the master can teleport into that room as 
if he has seen it too.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Deliver Touch Spells (Su): </i>If the master is 3rd 
level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the 
master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a 
touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The 
familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As 
usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, 
the touch spell dissipates.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Speak with Master (Ex): </i>If the master is 5th 
level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as 
if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand 
the communication without magical help.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex): </i>If the 
master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals 
of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): 
bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and
 ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with 
amphibians, weasels with similar creatures of the family Mustelidae 
(weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). 
Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing 
creatures.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Spell Resistance (Ex): </i>If the master is 11th 
level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's
 level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster 
must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level; see 
Spell Resistance, page 177) that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell 
resistance.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Scry on Familiar (Sp): </i>If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the <i>scrying </i>spell) once per day.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>From the Sorcerer Entry (page 54):</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Familiar:</b> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing
 so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A 
familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is 
unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and 
servant.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, 
the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means 
he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the 
loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point 
total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or 
dismissal. For example, suppose that Hennet is a 3rd-level sorcerer with
 3,230 XP when his owl familiar is killed by a bugbear. Hennet makes a 
successful saving throw, so he loses 300 XP, dropping him below 3,000 XP
 and back to 2nd level (see the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>for rules 
for losing levels). A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for
 a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a 
character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point 
when this happy event occurs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From the Wizard Entry (page 57):</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Familiar:</b> A wizard can obtain a familiar in 
exactly the same manner as a sorcerer can. See the sorcerer description 
and the accompanying Familiars sidebar for details.</p>

<ul>
<li>For purposes of resolving <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> and other effects, a familiar has <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDie')">Hit Dice</a> equal to its own or equal to the master's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_characterlevel')">character level</a>, whichever is higher.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This effective Hit Dice total applies only when the 
familiar is subjected to some effect whose resolution depends on Hit 
Dice, such as <i>sleep, holy word, circle of death,</i> and the frightful presence special attack. The familiar does not gain any skills, improved <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilityscore')">ability scores</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_basesavebonus')">base saving throw bonus</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack bonus,</a> feats, or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>
 from its effective Hit Dice (though being a familiar improves most of 
these things -- read on), nor does the familiar increase in <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, a cat normally has 1/2 a Hit Die, and a <i>sleep</i> spell could normally affect eight cats (because <i>sleep</i>
 affects up to 4 Hit Dice worth of creatures). If a cat familiar has a 
5th-level master, however, it effectively has 5 Hit Dice for purposes of
 how spells affect it and it is not subject to a <i>sleep</i> spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Temporary Hit Dice increases that the master gains (such as from a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bard')">bard's</a><i>inspire greatness</i> power) don't increase a familiar's effective Hit Dice.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar's hit points are equal to one-half the master's hit points, rounded down.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The rules don't say so, but you can reasonably assume 
that a familiar uses its own hit points if they're higher than half the 
master's hit points.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Use the master's permanent hit point total when 
calculating the familiar's hit points. Include hit points from all the 
master's Hit Dice, including race and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_class')">class</a> Hit Dice. Include <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> hit points from the Toughness feat and from the master's permanent <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_%20')">Constitution</a>
 score. Do not add or subtract hit points from temporary changes to the 
master's Constitution score or temporary hit point boosts from spells 
such as <i>aid</i> or from effects that increase Hit Dice, such as the bard's <i>inspire greatness</i> power.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar's base attack bonus is the same as the master's.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">As with hit points, use the master's base attack bonus from all classes and racial Hit Dice.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When attacking, a familiar uses the master's base attack bonus, its own relevant <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitymodifier')">ability modifier</a> (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> as appropriate for the attack), plus the familiar's size modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar uses its own <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillrank')">skill ranks</a> or the master's, whichever are higher.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">A familiar is considered trained in any skill for which 
it has at least one rank. It also is trained in any skill for which the 
master has at least one rank. When both the master and the familiar have
 ranks in a skill, use only the highest number of ranks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When making a skill check, a familiar uses its effective
 skill ranks, its own relevant ability modifier (as appropriate for the 
skill), plus the familiar's size modifier (if applicable), any 
applicable feats the familiar has, its racial modifier, and any synergy 
bonuses the familiar has from its effective skill ranks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, a cat making a Hide check has a +4 racial 
modifier (+8 in areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth), a +8 size 
modifier, and a +2 Dexterity modifier. A standard cat has no Hide ranks,
 giving it a +14 Hide bonus. If the cat is a familiar whose master has 2
 ranks in the Hide skill, the cat gets the benefit of those ranks and 
its Hide bonus becomes +16 (+20 in tall grass or heavy undergrowth).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Traits and Features</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Familiars have several abilities and traits that 
function only when the familiar is in fairly close proximity to the 
master, and a few more that function more or less all the time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Many of a familiar's special abilities depend on the 
master's level. In this case, "level" is the master's class level in a 
class that can have a familiar. If the master has two classes that can 
have familiars, add the class levels together. For example, a human 
10th-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_wizard')">wizard</a>, 5th-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fighter')">fighter</a>
 has 10 levels for purposes of determining familiar's special abilities 
(because fighter is not a class that can have a familiar). The example 
familiar still has 15 effective Hit Dice for resolving effects that 
depend on Hit Dice, and the familiar's hit points, base attack bonus, 
base saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks still are derived from the 
master's total Hit Dice (15).</p>
<p align="LEFT">A 5th-level wizard/5th-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_sorcerer')">sorcerer</a>
 also is level 10 (because both classes can have familiars). Such a 
familiar, however, has only 10 effective Hit Dice for resolving effects 
that depend on Hit Dice, and the familiar's hit points, base attack 
bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks are derived from their
 10 Hit Dice master.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some prestige classes grant spellcasters extra spells or
 extra levels of spellcasting. Such classes do not increase a familiar's
 abilities unless they also include an ability to have a familiar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Any <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_negativelevel')">negative levels</a>
 the master accrues have no effect on the familiar. If the master 
actually loses a level, however, the familiar's abilities are reduced 
accordingly. A master does not lose an improved familiar (from the 
Improved Familiar feat) if the character's level drops below the minimum
 requirement to obtain the improved familiar, but the improved familiar 
still suffers the effects of the level loss on its familiar abilities.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Here's an overview of familiar abilities that are affected by proximity to the master or the master's level, or both.</p>
<ul>
<li> The familiar's natural armor bonus improves.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The table on page 53 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> 
shows the increase. Add the value shown on the table to the familiar's 
normal natural armor bonus. For example, a standard cat's natural armor 
bonus is +0. A cat familiar with a 1st- or 2nd-level master has a 
natural armor bonus of +1.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This trait doesn't simply provide an extra <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalarmorbonus')">natural armor bonus</a>,
 it actually improves the familiar's racial natural armor bonus. 
Additional natural armor bonuses from items or spells, such as <i>amulets of natural armor </i>or <i>barkskin</i> spells stack with the natural armor bonus from this trait, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The natural armor bonus from this trait increases with 
the master's level, as shown on the table. The familiar gets the benefit
 of this trait for as long as it remains a familiar; distance between 
the master and familiar is not a factor.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a> score improves.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">A familiar has an Intelligence score of at least 6, or 
higher if the master's level is 3rd or higher, as shown on page 53 of 
the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. The threshold for humanlike intelligence is 3 (see page 9 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>),
 so a familiar is as smart as a person, but not necessarily as smart as a
 brilliant person or even an average person. A familiar's minimum 
Intelligence score of 6 makes it smart enough to understand at least one
 language, usually Common (though it doesn't gain the power of speech 
until the master reaches 5th level). This allows the familiar to respond
 to fairly elaborate commands and undertake fairly complex tasks. As 
rule of thumb, a 1st-level master's familiar is capable of doing 
anything a preadolescent human child can do. As the master's level 
increases, so does the familiar's ability to follow orders and perform 
tasks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A familiar does not learn new languages as its Intelligence increases along with its master's level.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A familiar uses its own Intelligence score if it is 
higher than what its master's level allows. A familiar can benefit from 
spells and effects that boost Intelligence, such as the <i>fox's cunning</i>
 spell. As with any temporary Intelligence increase, the Intelligence 
enhancement does not give the familiar any extra skill points or 
languages, but the familiar uses its new, higher, Intelligence modifier 
for Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks.</p>
