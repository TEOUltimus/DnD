<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">Last week, we took a look at actions in general and at 
circumstances that prevent you from acting. This week, we'll consider 
nonactions and the specifics of the disabled condition. We'll also 
consider free actions.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Kinds of Nonactions</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, a nonaction is something that 
effectively takes you no time at all, but still requires some attention 
or effort. The rules don't go into any detail about the kinds of 
nonactions in the game, but for our purposes they fall into three 
categories:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aggressive Nonactions:</b> There's only one activity 
that falls into this category: the attack of opportunity. An attack of 
opportunity is similar to the attack action. In general, if you cannot 
use a standard action during your turn, you also cannot make an attack 
of opportunity during someone else's turn. When the notes on conditions 
in Part One say that you cannot act (for example, when stunned), you 
cannot make an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">It's worth noting here that to threaten a space on the 
battlefield you must be able to make an armed attack into that space 
(see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20041026a">Rules of the Game: All About Attacks of Opportunity</a></i>). If you cannot use at least a standard action you cannot make an armed attack into any space.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't say so, but making an attack of 
opportunity should be considered strenuous; if you make an attack of 
opportunity while disabled, you take 1 point of damage after completing 
the attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nonactions with Other Actions:</b> When you can't 
perform the main action, you can't perform any nonactions that might 
accompany it. For example, if you can't use a standard action, you 
cannot activate most magic items and you also cannot make a Use Magic 
Device check to activate an item that requires a standard action to 
activate.</p>
<p align="left">You can take a 5-foot step anytime you don't otherwise 
move across the battlefield. You usually take a 5-foot step before, 
after, or during another action. The rules don't say so, but it's best 
to assume that you cannot take a 5-foot step unless you can take at 
least a move action during your turn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Reactive Nonactions: </b>It's usually best to allow 
characters to use nonactions, such as making opposed checks to resist 
being tripped or grappled, unless they're helpless (any ability score 
reduced to 0, paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious). It's worth noting, 
however, that even a helpless character can make a Reflex save (albeit 
with a -5 penalty for an effective Dexterity score of 0). That's because
 the game generally favors at least some involvement from the player -- 
and a chance for a miraculous escape -- whenever a character is in 
danger.</p>
<p align="left">A player reasonably can expect to make opposed checks 
that have a basically defensive nature, such as resisting a trip or 
grapple, even when a character is helpless. In such cases, the opposed 
check really represents fate intervening to foil the attacker rather 
than any determined resistance on the defender's part. No matter what 
kind of opposed check a helpless character makes, its best to apply a -5
 penalty on the check for a relevant ability score that's effectively 0 
when the action is basically physical (such as avoiding being tripped or
 grappled).</p>
<p align="left">All that said, a character cannot make or succeed at 
some opposed checks. For example, a blind character cannot make a Spot 
check to see a hidden foe, nor can a deaf character make a Listen check 
to hear someone sneaking up on her.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Disabled Condition</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, you're limited to one standard 
action or one move action (but not both) when you're disabled. You 
cannot use a full-round action while disabled.</p>
<p align="left">If you use a standard action or do anything strenuous 
while disabled, you take 1 point of damage after completing the action. 
The rules leave it to the DM to decide what's "strenuous." Since a 
standard action deals you damage when you're disabled, however, you can 
use the list of standard actions shown on Table 8-2 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 as a guide. Anything that resembles one of the standard actions shown 
there probably is sufficiently strenuous to hurt you when you're 
disabled. For example, making an attack of opportunity (as noted 
earlier) resembles the attack action and you take 1 point of damage if 
you make an attack of opportunity while disabled. Likewise, casting a 
quickened spell (a free action) also deals you damage because it's 
similar to casting a spell as a standard action.</p>
<p align="left">Some options you have when disabled aren't obvious. For 
example, the charge action is a full-round action; however, you can 
charge as a standard action when you're limited to standard actions 
(such as during a surprise round). You also can charge as a standard 
action when disabled; you take 1 point of damage when you do so. You 
also can withdraw as a standard action when disabled, but you also take 1
 point of damage when you do so.</p>
<p align="left">When an action you take when disabled deals you damage, 
you complete the action first, then take the damage. Since you have 0 
hit points when disabled, you usually collapse and immediately begin 
dying. If the action you use gains you hit points, you still take 1 
point of damage for using a standard or strenuous action while disabled,
 but your condition after taking that damage depends on your current hit
 point total. For example, you have 0 hit points and are disabled. You 
cast a <i>cure light wounds</i> spell that gives you 5 hit points. After
 casting the spell, you take 1 point of damage, leaving you with 4 hit 
points. Because you have a positive hit point total, you are not dying 
or disabled after taking the damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Free Action and Its Relatives</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
 PH pg 144: "Free Actions: Free actions don't take any time at all, 
though your DM may limit the number of free actions you can perform in a
 turn. Free actions rarely incur attacks of opportunity. Some common 
free actions are as follows: Drop an Item, Drop Prone, Speak, Cease 
Concentration on Spell, Cast a Quickened Spell." </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, a free action is something you do 
during your turn that takes hardly any time at all. Many people believe 
that a free action never provokes an attack of opportunity, but that is 
not a feature of free actions. It is true, however, that free actions 
rarely provoke attacks of opportunity. For example, none of the free 
actions noted on page 144 of the <i>Player's Handbook </i>provokes attacks of opportunity.<b></b><b></b></p>
<p align="left">You usually can perform a free action before, after, or 
during another action, circumstances permitting. For example, dropping 
an item is a free action. If you also move during your turn, you could 
drop an item at any point during the move. On the other hand, speaking a
 few words also is a free action. If you move, you could speak at any 
point during your move, but you could not speak while simultaneously 
casting a spell with a verbal component. If you tried to do so, you'd 
interrupt your own spell. You could, however, speak a few words before 
or after casting the spell. Likewise, you can cast only one spell at a 
time. You can't cast a quickened spell while casting another spell. When
 in doubt about when a free action can occur, the player and DM should 
discuss the matter.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot use a free action during another creature's 
turn. Speaking is an exception; you can speak during another creature's 
turn (see page 144 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Remember, however, 
that you're limited to just a few sentences. If you know where an 
invisible creature lurks, you can't tell a colleague where the creature 
is the moment your colleague acts (you could ready such an action, 
however -- see <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050705a">Part Four</a> -- and you'd really be using a variant of the Aid Another action).</p>
<p align="left"><b>It's Like a Free Action but It Isn't</b></p>
<p align="left">The<i> Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> introduced two new
 kinds of actions that are very similar to free actions. Like free 
actions, these actions take little or no time. Unlike free actions, 
there are strict limits on how many of these actions you can use in a 
single turn and when you can use them. Here's an overview:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swift Actions: </b>You can perform one (and only one) swift action during your turn. A swift action is otherwise just like a free action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Immediate Actions:</b> You can use an immediate 
action any time, even during another creature's turn. If you use an 
immediate action during your turn, you cannot use a swift action during 
your next turn. You cannot use another swift or immediate action until 
after your next turn.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next?</b></p>
<p align="left">That wraps up our look at nonactions and the disabled condition<i>. </i>Next week, we'll examine a few specific actions and how they function in play.</p>
