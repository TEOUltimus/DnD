<p align="left">From the player's or DM's point of view, a magic item is
 an object that provides the user with some paranormal ability that is 
stored or channeled within the object itself. Nothing puts a sparkle in a
 player's eye quite like a magic item. It represents power in the game 
world and serves as a badge of success among other players. Most of us 
just can't get enough magic items. Unfortunately, a magic item that 
looks cool on a character sheet can cause trouble in play, especially 
when the DM and the player can't quite agree on exactly how the thing 
works, as is often the case when the course of an adventure hangs in the
 balance.</p>
<p align="left">This article focuses on magic items and how they work. For an overview of the rules that govern magic in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, check out Chapter 10 in the <i>Player's Handbook. </i>Also see The Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Reading Spell Descriptions</a>. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Some Key Terms </b></p>
<p align="left">Here are a few terms you'll encounter in this article and in the rules when they discuss magic items.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Activation:</b> To make use of a magic item's powers,
 you must activate the item. In most cases, activating an item requires 
the activate magic item action, which is a standard action (see pages 
138 and 139 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for more on standard actions) that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">All magic items in the core <b>D&amp;D</b> game use one 
of four activation methods: Spell completion, spell trigger, command 
word, and use-activated. All of these are discussed on page 213 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> and in Part Two.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aura: </b>Most magic items have magical auras that <i>detect magic</i> spells can reveal. The power and school of an item's aura is shown in the item's description. See the <i>detect magic</i> spell description for details.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Caster Level:</b> Every magic item has a caster 
level, which the item's description shows. An item's caster level 
determines the item's own saving throw bonuses when the item must make a
 saving throw. If an item can produce a spell effect, its caster level 
determines any level-based variables the spell effect might have (such 
as range and damage). An item's caster level also determines how 
susceptible the item or the spell effects it produces are to <i>dispel magic</i> effects.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Charge:</b> A discrete unit of an item's power that 
is used up when someone activates the item. For example, a newly created
 wand has 50 charges. An item becomes nonmagical when all its charges 
are used up.</p>
<p align="left">In general, a charged item cannot be recharged.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Item Slot:</b> A specific part of the user's body where an item must be worn before it can function. Sometimes it is simply called a slot.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Market Price: </b>The cost, in gold pieces, that an 
item brings on the open market. Sometimes this is simply called price. 
An item's market price is a retail price (or the price a character must 
pay when buying the item). Characters who sell used items can expect to 
get only half the market price.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Kinds of Magic Items </b></p>
<p align="left">The <b>D&amp;D</b> game divides magic items into nine broad categories, which are described in Chapter 7 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.
 Individual magic item descriptions tend to be very brief, and many 
details that determine how an item works in play are contained in the 
notes for the item's category. Here's an overview:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Armor and Shields:</b> These protective magic items work just like their nonmagical counterparts (see Chapter 7 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).
 That is, a magic heavy shield works pretty much just like a nonmagical 
heavy shield in addition to any magical properties it has.</p>
<p align="left">Though the rules don't come right out and say so, you 
must wear magic armor to use any of its abilities. Likewise, you must 
pick up a magic shield and either hold it in your hand or strap it to 
your arm (or what passes for an arm if you're not humanoid), or both as 
appropriate for the kind the shield, to get any benefit from the shield.
 </p>
<p align="left">Most purely defensive properties that a set of magic 
armor or a magic shield has (such as enhancement bonus to Armor Class, 
resistance to energy, or the like) work continuously once you don the 
armor or have the shield ready on your arm. Most other special abilities
 (such as attacking foes or magical travel) require you to both wear the
 armor (or properly wield the shield) and speak a command word.</p>
<p align="left">All magic armor and shields are masterwork items, and 
any armor check penalties they impose on you are reduced by one point, 
to a minimum of 0. (Just in case you're wondering, arcane spell failure 
chances aren't reduced unless the item description specifically says so 
or the item is made from a special material that reduces them, such as 
mithral.)</p>
<p align="left">Prices given for armor assumes armor made for Medium 
humanoids. Armor for most other creatures entails an additional cost, as
 noted on pages 123 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> When armor is made 
for an unusual creature, subtract the armor cost for a Medium humanoid 
and then add the armor cost for the unusual creature. </p>
<p align="left">For example, a suit of <i>+1 half-plate armor</i> 
usually costs 1,750 gp, which includes 1,000 gp for the +1 enhancement, 
600 gp for a suit of half-plate armor, and 150 gp for masterwork armor. A
 suit of <i>+1 half-plate barding</i> for a war horse would cost 3,550 
gp, which includes 1,000 gp for the +1 enhancement, 2,400 gp for a suit 
of half-plate armor for a large nonhumanoid wearer, and 150 gp for 
masterwork armor.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weapons:</b> Like magic armor and shields, magic 
weapons function just like normal weapons, and they're masterwork items,
 too. Even if a magic weapon's magical properties are suppressed (as 
they would be in an <i>antimagic field</i>), the weapon still provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls thanks to its masterwork quality.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't say so, but you must hold a magic weapon
 in one or two hands (as appropriate for the weapon) to use any of its 
magical properties. You cannot, for example, use a sword's spell-like 
abilities while you have the sword put away in its scabbard.</p>
<p align="left">You get any enhancement bonus on attack rolls that the 
weapon provides simply by attacking with the weapon. Most other powers, 
however, require you to hold the weapon and speak a command word.</p>
<p align="left">Most magic ranged weapons that use ammunition impart 
some of their magical properties to ammunition fired from them. The 
ranged weapon's enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls applies to 
the ranged attack, even if the ammunition isn't magical, and the 
ammunition overcomes damage reduction just as if it were a magic weapon 
itself. If both the ammunition and the weapon have enhancement bonuses, 
however, they do not stack under the <b>D&amp;D</b> 3.5 rules (they did stack in <b>D&amp;D</b>
 3.0), only the highest enhancement bonus applies. If the weapon has an 
alignment, it imparts that alignment to the ammunition, and the 
ammunition overcomes damage reduction accordingly. If the ammunition 
already has an alignment, it has both its own alignment and the weapon's
 alignment when fired, even if those two alignments are opposed to each 
other. (The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> uses the example of anarchic 
ammunition fired from an axiomatic weapon, making the ammunition both 
lawful and chaotic when fired; see page 221.)</p>
<p align="left">When a ranged weapon has another magical property that 
can affect things the weapon hits in combat, the weapon might also 
impart that property to ammunition fired from it; see the descriptions 
for the various weapon powers on pages 223-226. For example, a <i>flaming</i> bow imparts the <i>flaming</i> property to arrows fired from it.</p>
<p align="left">If the ammunition already has one or more magical 
properties, add the weapon's properties to the ammunition's properties. 
DMs can, and probably should, place some limits on what properties 
ammunition can receive. For example, it probably wouldn't do for 
ammunition to receive the same property twice; that is, you'd get no 
extra effect from firing arrows with the <i>flaming</i> property from a bow with the <i>flaming</i> property.</p>
<p align="left">Like armor, weapon costs assume a Medium wielder; adjust the cost for bigger or smaller wielders as noted for armor.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Potions and Oils:</b> These items are essentially 
precast spells in liquid form. You trigger the spell by drinking the 
potion or smearing on the oil; this is a standard action that provokes 
attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">If an attack hits you while you're drinking a potion or 
applying an oil, you must make a Concentration check. The check DC is 10
 + the damage dealt. The rules say that you make the check exactly as if
 you were casting a spell, which would make the check DC 10 + spell 
level + the damage dealt; however, you aren't really casting a spell 
when you're drinking a potion or applying an oil, so the spell level 
isn't relevant. Using a potion or oil on yourself is always a standard 
action, no matter what casting time the stored spell normally requires 
(see Part Two)</p>
<p align="left">If you fail a Concentration check while drinking a 
potion or applying an oil, you can't use the potion or oil, but the item
 isn't wasted. You foes, however, can direct their attacks (even attacks
 of opportunity) at the vial containing the potion or oil and could 
break the container and effectively destroy the potion or oil.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rings:</b> To use a ring, you must wear it on your 
hand (or on what passes for a hand). Most rings are activated with a 
command word, but some work continuously once you put them on, and some 
work automatically whenever you do something that the ring affects. In 
general, when a ring produces a spell effect, you must use a command 
word to activate it. Rings that give you some kind of bonus (such as a 
skill bonus or an Armor Class bonus) work continuously or work 
automatically when you need them. Rings with defensive abilities usually
 work continuously, and rings that allow some kind of attack (such as 
shooting stars or ramming) require a command word. In most cases, the 
ring's description will at least give you a hint about how the ring is 
activated -- look for words and phrases such as "on command," 
"continuously," or "as a free action." Note that even when you can 
activate an item as a free action, you usually can do so only during 
your turn. Beware of rings that produce spell effects with unusual 
casting times, however. For example, a <i>ring of</i><i>feather falling</i>
 requires a free action to activate because you cast the spell as a free
 action. You also can activate the ring when it's not your turn, just as
 you can cast the spell when it isn't your turn.</p>
<p align="left">Rings generally fit any corporeal creature, regardless of the creature's size. If you don't have a <i>detect magic</i>
 spell handy, you could try to put on a ring you've found. If it just 
happens to fit, it could be a magic ring. (Though a crafty DM might 
decide that a magic ring won't resize itself unless you know it's 
magical before you put it on.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rods: </b>Rods look like short sticks or scepters, and some of them are heavy and sturdy enough to function as clubs or maces.</p>
<p align="left">Many rods are activated by command word, though a few 
require some specific action, such as pressing a catch in the rod or 
planting the rod in the ground, and some rods work automatically. Most 
of the comments on activating rings also apply to rods, but it always 
pays to check the rod's description for the activation method. Some rods
 have different activation methods for different functions. For example,
 you can configure a <i>rod of lordly might</i> to serve as various 
kinds of weapons, and you do so by pressing catches on the rod. 
Manipulating a catch works just like drawing a weapon (see the first 
paragraph in the rod's description). That means you can operate a catch 
as a move action, or as part of a move action if your base attack bonus 
is at least +1. Presumably, you can operate a catch as free action if 
you have the Quick Draw feat. A <i>rod of lordly might</i> also has 
spell-like abilities that require a command word (and thus a standard 
action) to activate, though some of those work by touch, so your 
standard action to activate the spell-like ability also includes the 
touch attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Scrolls:</b> A scroll is essentially a precast spell 
in written form. Scrolls can be tricky to use because you must first 
decipher the writing on them and then read the scroll. The whole process
 is detailed on page 238 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. Also see the Spell Completion section in Part Two for notes on activating scrolls.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Staffs:</b> A staff holds several different spell 
effects that you trigger with the spell trigger activation method (see 
Part Two). A staff has charges, and you expend one or more charges 
whenever you use the staff.</p>
<p align="left">To activate a staff, you must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand) and speak a single word.</p>
<p align="left">A staff is about the size of a quarterstaff made for a 
Medium creature, and you could assume that a staff can function as a 
Medium masterwork quarterstaff. In fact, Table 7-32 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 says that the cost to create a staff includes 300 gp for a masterwork 
quarterstaff (though this is not mentioned in the notes for staff 
creation on page 287).</p>
<p align="left">Staffs also are unusual because the user's caster level 
and spell save DC modifiers can be used instead of the staff's (see Part
 Three).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wands: </b>A wand is a fairly flimsy stick that holds
 a single spell. Wands have charges; activating a wand releases the 
spell in it and consumes a charge.</p>
<p align="left">Wands use the spell trigger activation method (see Part 
Two). To activate a wand, you must hold it one hand (or whatever passes 
for a hand) and speak a single word.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wondrous Items:</b> This is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups.</p>
<p align="left">Using a wondrous item usually requires you to wear the 
item (if it's something that's usually worn, such as a cloak, boot, or 
gauntlet), or held in the hand (if it's something that's usually held, 
such as a tool or musical instrument). A few wondrous items work 
whenever you carry the item with you, for example, a <i>pearl of power.</i>
 Bigger items, such as magic mirrors, have to be propped up or attached 
to a wall. And a couple of wondrous items are just plain weird. For 
example, you have to toss an <i>ioun stone</i> into the air so that it can orbit your head. As always, check the item's description to find out how it's used.</p>
<p align="left">The notes on activating rings generally also apply to wondrous items.</p>
<p align="left">Also like rings, wondrous items that have to be worn adjust their sizes to fit any user.</p>
