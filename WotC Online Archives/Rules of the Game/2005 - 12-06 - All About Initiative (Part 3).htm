<p align="left">Last week, we considered the ins and outs beginning an 
encounter. This week, we'll tackle an even more difficult topic -- 
deciding when an encounter is over. After that, we'll wrap up our look 
at initiative by considering a few related topics.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>When Does an Encounter End?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The rules don't give much guidance about deciding when an encounter is over. Nevertheless, the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DM</a>
 is obliged to declare an end to one encounter before the party can move
 on to the next encounter. As noted in Part One, declaring an 
encounter's end also can speed play by allowing <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a>
 a chance to recover and reorganize without the burden of working though
 the initiative order over and over again. Also, there's at least one 
effect in the game that lasts for the duration of an encounter. A <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a> (usually a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_barbarian')">barbarian</a>) who has used the rage class feature remains <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fatigued')">fatigued</a>
 for the duration of an encounter. Because the fatigue resulting from 
barbarian rage ends when the encounter ends, determining exactly when 
the encounter ends can prove crucial.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In Part One, I suggested that characters should remain 
in initiative order until all danger the encounter poses to them is 
past. That also is a pretty good rule of thumb for marking an 
encounter's end. Any or all of the following conditions might signal an 
encounter's end:</p>
<ul>
<li> All foes the party faces in an encounter are defeated.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Foes are defeated when they're dead, dying, or otherwise unable to function offensively. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">Creatures</a> that have fled the encounter or surrendered should be considered defeated for purposes of marking an encounter's end.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes, a foe might withdraw for a short time and 
then return to mount a new attack. If the returning foe has been away 
for significant time (say a full minute, or 10 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">rounds</a>)
 and the party either has not bothered to locate the foe or hasn't made 
any effective efforts to do so, it's probably best to treat the return 
as a new encounter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a foe flees and the party pursues closely enough so 
that the foe must keep moving to avoid being attacked, the encounter 
isn't over until the party breaks off the pursuit. Likewise, if the 
party can pursue and attack (perhaps with spells or ranged weaponry), 
the encounter isn't over.</p>
<ul>
<li> All members of the party are defeated.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Use the same criteria for defeat noted above.</p>
<ul>
<li> Both sides agree to cease hostilities.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This could be a plainly stated agreement to stop 
fighting, or both sides might choose to withdraw from the battlefield 
(or at least put some space between each other).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Combatants could possibly effectively enter a truce 
simply by ceasing all hostile actions, but stand their ground. If an 
encounter enters a phase where nobody is attacking a foe and the two 
groups simply talk or observe each other, you might wish to declare the 
encounter over. You can use the same criteria suggested above for 
dealing with a foe that leaves the scene of a battle and returns to 
fight later. If the truce has held for about a minute and it seems 
nobody is inclined to fight, go ahead and declare the encounter over. 
You can do that even if you've got one or two suspicious holdouts on 
either (or both sides). Such characters might ready actions to resume 
combat if anyone makes a false move. It's perfectly okay to allow the 
diehards in a group to stand there, tense and scowling, while everyone 
else relaxes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Of course, hostilities might break out again, marking 
the beginning of a new encounter. A group that finds itself in a bad 
situation might want to feign a truce just to get the chance to jump the
 foe again. If you're in doubt about whether to start a new encounter 
with a new initiative order or to simply resume the action with the old 
initiative order, use an appropriate skill check to determine if the 
"previous" encounter ever really came to an end. A Diplomacy check that 
moves a foe's attitude from hostile to unfriendly (or more favorable) 
would do the trick (decisively ending hostilities). A Bluff check to put
 a foe at least temporarily at ease also would do the trick.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you decide to continue using an old initiative order,
 simply pick up the action starting with whichever combatant has decided
 to resume hostilities (adjusting for any readied actions left over from
 the previous encounter).</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you decide to use a new initiative order, place 
anyone who has a readied action at the beginning of the order (to 
reflect the character's state of wariness). If several characters have 
readied actions, place them in order of their initiative modifiers, and 
use <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a>
 checks to break any ties). Creature that don't have readied actions 
check initiative normally, except that they're placed in the order after
 creatures with readied actions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's usually best to skip the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_surprise')">surprise</a>
 round when the action resumes after a break in hostilities. If someone 
has really managed to hoodwink the opposition and has made them lower 
their guard, however, a surprise round might be in order. In such a 
case, the deceitful character (and any allies who are in on the ruse) 
should be the only character (or characters) who act during the surprise
 round, even though many other characters at the scene are aware of 
their foes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Some Initiative Miscellany</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A few other aspects of initiative can cause trouble from
 time to time. Usually a careful look at the rules -- or a little common
 sense -- will solve the problem.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Delaying and Readying</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in Part One, both of these options can change 
the initiative order during a battle. The ready and delay actions are 
discussed in detail on page 160 in the <i>Player's Handbook, </i>and in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050614a">Rules of the Game: All About Actions</a></i>. Here are a few more notes:</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the page 160 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Initiative Actions</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are ways to change when you act during combat by altering your place in the initiative order.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Delay</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act 
normally on whatever initiative count you decide to act. When you delay,
 you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the 
combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same
 round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative result
 or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, thus 
fixing your new initiative count at that point.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Delaying is useful if you need to see what your friends 
or opponents are going to do before deciding what to do yourself. The 
price you pay is lost initiative. You never get back the time you spend 
waiting to see what's going to happen. You can't, however, interrupt 
anyone else's action (as you can with a readied action).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Initiative Consequences of Delaying:</b> Your 
initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed 
action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an 
action, you don't get to take a delayed action (though you can delay 
again). If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your 
regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in 
the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ready</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The ready action lets you prepare to take an action 
later, after your turn is over but before your next one has begun. 
Readying is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of 
opportunity (though the action that you ready might do so).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Readying an Action:</b> You can ready a standard 
action, a move action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action 
you will take and the conditions under which you will take it. For 
example, you might specify that you will shoot an arrow at anyone coming
 through a nearby doorway. Then, any time before your next action, you 
may take the readied action in response to that condition. The action 
occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action 
is part of another character's activities, you interrupt the other 
character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his 
actions once you complete your readied action.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Your initiative result changes. For the rest of the 
encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the 
readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose 
action triggered your readied action.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied 
action, but only if you don't otherwise move any distance during the 
round. For instance, if you move up to an open door and then ready an 
action to swing your sword at whatever comes near, you can't take a 
5-foot step along with the readied action (since you've already moved in
 this round). Initiative <b>Consequences of Readying:</b> Your 
initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied 
action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your 
readied action, you don't get to take the readied action (though you can
 ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the 
next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count 
rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your 
regular action that round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Distracting Spellcasters:</b> You can ready an attack
 against a spellcaster with the trigger "if she starts casting a spell."
 If you damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to
 cast (as determined by her Concentration check result).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Readying to Counterspell:</b> You may ready a 
counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger "if she 
starts casting a spell"). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a 
spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + 
spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able 
to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast 
the spell as a counterspell and automatically ruin the other 
spellcaster's spell. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine 
and the other arcane.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A spellcaster can use <i>dispel magic </i>(page 223) to counterspell another spellcaster, but it doesn't always work.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Readying a Weapon against a Charge:</b> You can ready
 certain piercing weapons, setting them to receive charges (see Table 
7-5: Weapons, page 116). A readied weapon of this type deals double 
damage if you score a hit with it against a charging character.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Delay:</b> Delay is a nonaction. That is, it doesn't 
use up any of your time in a round. When delaying, you can specify a 
point in a round when you want to act (for example, right after a 
particular ally acts, or any other point you can manage to specify). Or 
you can simply wait until the time seems right and take your turn.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When you act, you assume that turn in the initiative 
order for the remainder of the encounter (unless you ready or delay 
again). For example, you act first in a round, with an initiative result
 of 20. An ally acts next with an initiative result 18, followed by foes
 with initiative results of 13, 11, and 8, and a final ally with an 
initiative result of 2. If you delay until your first foe acts, you take
 your turn after that foe, and than means you act between initiative 
counts 13 and 11 (effectively at count 12). You cannot interrupt the 
action your foe takes at count 13, but you have a full round's worth of 
actions (that is a standard action plus a move action, or a full-round 
action) to use during your delayed turn.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can use a delay to act <i>earlier</i> in the 
initiative order. To do so, you must delay and then wait to act until 
the next round begins (as noted in Part One, a new round begins after 
the last combatant in the previous round has acted).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Let's say the combat in the previous example continues. 
Thanks to your earlier delay, you're now the third combatant to act in 
the initiative order (the new order is now 18, 13, 12, 11, 8, 2). If you
 delay until after the round ends (after the combatant with the 
initiative result of 2 acts), you can choose to act before anyone else 
acts in the following round. Once you do so, you'll keep your new 
position in the initiative order until you (or another combatant) 
changes the initiative order again.</p>
<p align="LEFT">So, what happens if two combatants delay and decide to 
act in the same place in the round? I recommend resolving the situation 
the same way you resolve tied initiative checks. The combatant with the 
highest initiative modifier goes first and if the two combatants have 
the same initiative modifier, they make initiative checks to break the 
tie.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ready:</b> Ready is a standard action that allows you
 to prepare another standard action or a move action at some later point
 in the round. You must specify some condition that triggers your 
readied action.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ready has advantages and disadvantages when compared to 
delay. The main advantage ready has over delay is that you resolve your 
readied action before the event that triggers it and you sometimes can 
disrupt a foe's action, such as when you ready an action to distract a 
spellcaster.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The main disadvantage ready has versus delay is that you
 can ready only a standard or move action -- you don't get a full 
round's worth of actions when you ready.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The other big disadvantage to readying is that you're 
pretty well stuck if things don't go according to plan. For example, 
suppose you ready an attack against the first enemy that comes through a
 door and a 20-ton boulder rolls out instead. You're pretty much obliged
 to stand there and get crushed (though one hopes you'll be allowed a 
Reflex save to avoid the worst effects) even though you theoretically 
have an action available to you when the boulder makes its entrance. 
Encounters in the game are just too fast-moving and confusing to allow 
you to change plans between your turns in the initiative order.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When you use your readied action, you move to that place
 in the initiative order, and you stay at your new place until the order
 changes again. The change in the initiative order works pretty much as 
described in the section on delay, except that you act before the event 
that triggers your readied action.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Inactive Characters</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Characters who have been rendered inactive (for example, by being <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_paralyzed')">paralyzed</a> or reduced to negative <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>) can become active again after whatever ails them is removed. According to the <i>Player's Handbook,</i>
 these characters retain their places in the initiative order and can 
act again when their next turns come. The rules don't say so, but it's 
best to assume that these characters are not flat-footed when they 
reenter the fray (because they never really left).</p>
<p align="LEFT">This rule, while easy to use and remember, can produce 
some odd results from time to time. For example, if you return to the 
action just before your next turn, you get to act right away. If you 
return just after your turn comes up, however, you must wait an entire 
round to act. To make a character's return to activity a little more 
predictable, try this completely unofficial rule: Allow a character who 
has missed at least one turn due involuntary inactivity to act 
immediately after being revived. The effect on the character's 
initiative is exactly the same as it would be if the revived character 
had delayed for a round or more.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>In Conclusion </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That wraps up our look at initiative. I've attempted to cover a few gaps in the initiative rules. The <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game being what it is, you'll probably encounter a few more tricky 
areas. When you deal with these, remember that the key decision you have
 to make is whether an encounter has already begun or is merely about to
 begin. Once you've made that determination, the rest of your task 
should prove fairly simple.</p>
