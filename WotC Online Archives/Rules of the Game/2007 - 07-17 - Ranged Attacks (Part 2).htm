<p align="LEFT">Last week, we considered the basics of ranged combat. This week, we'll consider the ins and outs of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_thrownweapon')">thrown weapons</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using Thrown Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in Part One, a thrown weapon is something that you launch at a target yourself. Also as noted in Part One, your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> modifier affects your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack roll</a> with a thrown weapon and your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> modifier affects your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damageroll')">damage roll</a> if your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a> hits (except for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_splashweapon')">splash weapons</a>; see below).</p>
<p align="LEFT"> Because you're throwing the weapon itself, you must draw it before you can attack with it. Drawing a weapon requires a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moveaction')">move action</a>, leaving you with only a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_standardaction')">standard action</a> for the attack. Because you're attacking with a standard action, you can make only a single attack. If you have a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack bonus</a> of at least +1 you can draw a weapon as part of a regular move (see page 141 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). See <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i>
 for a discussion of exactly what a regular move is. In this case, 
you're still using a move action for the regular move, and you're still 
limited to attacking as a standard action.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> If you can draw your thrown weapon without using an action, or as a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_freeaction')">free action</a>, you can throw as a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fullroundaction')">full-round action</a>
 and make iterative attacks with several thrown weapons (one per attack)
 if your base attack bonus allows. One easy way to manage this trick is 
by taking the Quick Draw feat, which lets you draw weapons as free 
action. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Thrown weapons tend to be fairly sturdy and usually 
aren't destroyed when you throw them. Splash weapons, however, are 
expended when you use them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Throwing Melee Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can throw any melee weapon whose statistics don't include a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangeincrement')">range increment</a>,
 provided you can wield it in one or two hands. You can hurl such a 
weapon up to 50 feet; it effectively has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You always take a -4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalty</a>
 for nonproficiency when you throw a weapon that's not meant to be 
thrown -- it just doesn't work well in that role. Throwing a melee 
weapon that's not suitable for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attacks</a>
 requires a standard action if you can wield it in one hand. If you must
 use two hands to wield the weapon, throwing it requires a full-round 
action. Because you need a standard or full-round action to throw such a
 weapon once, you cannot make iterative attacks when doing so.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Some Selected Thrown Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are a few thrown weapons worth discussing, either 
because they're a little strange or just because doing so will allow us 
to cover a few points we haven't examined yet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dagger:</b> A dagger is one of several thrown weapons that you can use in melee or at range. It works just like a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeweapon')">melee weapon</a>
 when you use it in a melee attack. When you chuck the dagger at a 
target, you treat it as a thrown weapon. Use your Dexterity modifier for
 the attack roll when you throw it, and then use your Strength modifier 
for the damage roll if your attack hits. When you make a ranged attack 
by throwing a dagger, the act provokes <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackofopportunity')">attacks of opportunity</a>, as noted in Part One, even though you can make melee attacks with the dagger that do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because a dagger has a range increment of only 10 feet, you almost always take a range penalty when throwing it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Javelin:</b> These lightweight spears are cheap and 
have a fairly decent range increment of 30 feet, which makes their 
maximum range 150 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A javelin is one of several ranged weapons that you can 
use in melee even though they're not really suited for the job. When you
 make a melee attack with a javelin, you resolve the action just like 
any other melee attack, except that you always have a nonproficiency 
penalty (-4) on your attack roll.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shuriken:</b> These little throwing stars work just 
like ammunition (see Part Three). On the plus side, you don't need to 
use an action to draw a shuriken, which means you can throw more than 
one of them if you use the full attack action and if your base attack 
bonus allows multiple attacks. On the negative side, you tend to use up 
shuriken as you throw them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Shuriken are on the list of special <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_monk')">monk</a>
 weapons, so a monk character can use the flurry of blows class feature 
to throw extra shuriken when using the full attack action.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Splash Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">These thrown weapons break on impact, scattering their contents, which usually are liquid.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 158 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>THROW SPLASH WEAPON</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on 
impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby 
creatures or objects. Most splash weapons consist of liquids, such as 
acid or holy water, in breakable vials such as glass flasks. (See 
Special Substances and Items, page 128, for particulars about several 
different splash weapons.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch 
attack against the target. Thrown weapons require no weapon proficiency,
 so you don't take the -4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit
 damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet 
of the target.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can instead target a specific grid intersection. 
Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a 
grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the 
splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. 
(You can't target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a 
Large or larger creature; in this case, you're aiming at the creature.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a
 grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the 
throw, with 1 being straight back at you and 2 through 8 counting 
clockwise around the grid intersection or target creature. Then, count a
 number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range 
increment of the throw. So, if you miss on a throw out to two range 
increments and roll a 1 to determine the misdirection of the throw, the 
splash weapon lands on the intersection that is 2 squares away from the 
target in the direction toward you. See the accompanying diagram.</p>
<p align="LEFT">After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Because most splash weapons' damage is derived from the 
properties inherent in their contents (for example fire damage from a 
flask of alchemist's fire), your Strength modifier usually doesn't apply
 to a splash weapon's damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When you throw a splash weapon, you either aim the 
weapon directly at a target or at a grid intersection. In the former 
case, you make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedtouchattack')">ranged touch attack</a> against your target. In the latter case, you make a ranged attack against <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a> 5. A splash weapon has a range increment of 10 feet unless another is specified in the weapon description.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="285"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2007-17%20-%20Ranged%20Attacks%20%28Part%202%29_files/dx20070710_splashmiss.jpg" border="1" height="285" width="285"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Lidda (L) and Tordek (T) face two wights (W) at an 
intersection of corridors in a dungeon. While Tordek attacks one wight 
with his battleaxe, Lidda tosses a vial of holy water at the second 
wight, which is 20 feet away. Lidda makes a ranged touch attack against 
the wight. Lidda has a -8 penalty on the attack: -4 nonproficiency 
(which applies to all splash weapon attacks) and another -4 for 
attacking a target two range increments away (a splash weapon has a 
range increment of 10 feet). Lidda's attack misses, and Lidda's player 
must roll 1d8 to determine where the flask actually lands. The roll is a
 3, indicating a miss to the left. The vial lands 10 feet to the left (5
 feet per range increment; see page 158 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Lidda, however, could not toss anything into the 
indicated space from where she stands, thanks to the wall on her left. 
To determine where the vial really lands, the DM traces a line from one 
corner of Lidda's space to a corner of the indicated landing space. The 
flask strikes where the line intersects the wall, splashing Tordek and 
the first wight with holy water (because they're both within 5 feet of 
the square where the vial actually landed).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">When you hit a target with a splash weapon, the contents
 sprays out over the target and everything within 5 feet of that target.
 The target struck takes damage for a direct hit; other targets take 
splash damage. The splash weapon's direct and splash damage ratings are 
given in the weapon's description.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though the rules aren't entirely clear on the matter, I 
suggest that you apply splash damage to all adjacent targets only when 
the primary target fills one 5-foot space or less -- that is, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a> or smaller targets. Against a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Large')">Large</a>
 or bigger target, apply splash damage only against secondary targets 
that are within 5 feet of the point of impact. To determine the point of
 impact, just have the attacker choose one of the squares the target 
occupies. The attacker must have <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofeffect')">line of effect</a> to the square chosen.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If an attacker hits a grid intersection with a splash 
weapon, everything in the squares adjacent to the intersection takes 
splash damage from the weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the attacker using a splash weapon misses (either 
against a target attacked directly or against a grid intersection), use 
the procedure on page 158 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> to determine 
where the weapon lands. Creatures and objects within 5 feet of the place
 where the weapon lands take splash damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When tossing splash weapons in a restricted area, it's 
possible that the rules will indicate that a miss puts a splash weapon 
someplace where the attacker couldn't possibly have thrown it. In such 
cases, determine the place where the splash weapon normally would land 
according to the rules on page 158. Then, trace a line from one corner 
of the attacker's space to the landing spot. To select the corner, you 
can allow the attacker to choose or simply select the corner that's 
nearest to the landing spot or the corner that seems most appropriate to
 the situation. Trace a line from the selected corner to the landing 
spot. The splash weapon actually lands at the first point where the line
 strikes a solid barrier. The accompanying diagram illustrates the 
process.</p>
