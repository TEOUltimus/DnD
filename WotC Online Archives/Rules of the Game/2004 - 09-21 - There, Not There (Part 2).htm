<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="LEFT">The section on invisibility in Chapter 8 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> contains a great deal of information about invisibility's ramifications in combat. Take a look at the highlights.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Dealing With Invisibility in Combat</b></p>
<ul>
<li> When you can't see a creature (for whatever reason), you still can 
attack it, but first you must determine or guess at its location on the 
battlefield.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Several special qualities, such as blindsense, 
tremorsense, and scent, allow you to locate unseen creatures (though you
 must be fairly close to the creature to locate it with scent).</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can use a Spot or Listen check to locate a creature 
you cannot see, though doing so is very difficult indeed (see Spotting, 
Listening, and Pinpointing).</p>
<ul>
<li> If you locate an unseen creature (or you're just guessing where it 
is), you can direct a melee or ranged attack into that location.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> Because you cannot see the creature, your attack has a 50% miss chance. The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 says the DM can waive or reduce the miss chance when the target is 
particularly large and slow. As a rule of thumb, you can reduce the miss
 chance by 5% for every size category the target is beyond Large. If the
 target is size Huge or bigger, also reduce the miss chance 5% for every
 5 feet that the creature's current speed is below 30 feet. Also, reduce
 the miss chance by 20% if the attack is aimed more or less at the 
creature's center, or if the creature is using the squeezing rules (see 
page 29 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>) to move into a locale 
narrower than its space. Finally, reduce the miss chance another 10% if 
the creature is particularly blocky or massive for its size category. 
All the reductions stack, but a miss chance cannot be less than 0. For 
example, a black pudding is a Huge creature with a speed of 20 feet. As 
an ooze, it's just a big blob, and both exceptionally blocky and massive
 for its size category. Attacking an unseen black pudding entails a miss
 chance of only 20% (base 50% -10% for size Huge, -10 for speed, -10 for
 mass). The example black pudding has a space listing of 15 feet (three 
squares by three squares). If the attack is aimed at the pudding's 
center square, the miss chance is 0%.</p>
<ul>
<li> Unseen creatures are immune to certain kinds of special attacks and spells.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Any attack that depends on hitting a foe in a particular
 place or in a particular way doesn't work against an unseen foe. Sneak 
attacks and bonus damage from the favored enemy class feature falls into
 this category. The DM might decide to include others as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a spell has a target or targets entry, you must see 
or touch your target to aim the spell at it. Even if you know where your
 unseen target is, you still can't aim a targeted spell at it if you 
don't see or touch it.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spotting, Listening, and Pinpointing</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted earlier, you can use a Spot or Listen check to locate something that's invisible.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spotting</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you can't discern an invisible thing visually, how on
 earth do you spot it? Well, the rules aren't clear on that point. 
However, invisible things often leave visible clues to their presence. 
Exactly what forms these clues take depend largely on what the invisible
 thing is and what its surroundings might be like. For example, an 
invisible creature walking around in a dungeon might leave the 
occasional footprint or set dust motes swirling in the air. A creature 
that has been invisible for a long time might even pick up enough dust 
and debris that it develops a faint outline. Also, some invisibility 
effects aren't perfect. Perhaps an invisible thing creates the faintest 
shimmer or distortion in the air, or casts a really feeble shadow. Such 
phenomena might prove very difficult to detect, but perceptive 
individuals might see them and recognize them for what they are.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spot Check DCs </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Considerable confusion often arises regarding how 
difficult a Spot check to notice or locate an invisible thing is; the 
latter is much harder than most people realize. That's because the basic
 Spot DCs noted in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> are for merely 
noticing that there's something unseen somewhere within 30 feet. The DC 
for actually pinpointing an invisible thing's location so that you know 
where to aim an attack is 20 points higher. The table below shows the 
Spot DCs for various kinds of invisible things. The DCs given here are 
higher than those shown in the <i>Player's Handbook's </i>glossary (pages 309-310), and they match the numbers given in the<i> Dungeon Master's Guide</i> glossary (page 295).</p>
<p align="LEFT">According to the Spot skill description, it doesn't take
 an action to make a check to notice or locate an invisible thing when 
you first have a chance to do so. After that, however, it takes a move 
action to spot something you failed to see earlier. In this case, 
however, I recommend that you make spotting an invisible creature a free
 action each round, at least when there's an active invisible creature 
(see below) involved.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a Spot check result is too low to locate an 
invisible creature, but high enough to notice that it's within 30 feet, 
the character making the check notices the creature (see below). It's 
best to make the Spot check secretly so that players cannot be sure if 
they're actually dealing with invisible foes.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spot DC to Notice:</b> If the check is successful, 
you merely know there's something unseen within 30 feet of you. If the 
invisible thing is more than 30 feet away, you cannot notice it with a 
Spot check. According to the rules, any time you make a Spot check you 
take a -1 penalty on the check for every 10 feet of distance between you
 and what you're spotting.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You must repeat the check each turn to keep track of the unseen thing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spot DC to Locate:</b> If the check is successful, 
you know exactly where the invisible thing is (you have pinpointed its 
location), including what square or squares on the battlefield it 
occupies. Apply the penalty for distance to this check (-1 per 10 feet).</p>
<p align="LEFT">You must repeat the check each turn to keep track of the unseen thing. I recommend you make this a free action each round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Active Creature:</b> For purposes of spotting an 
invisible creature, it is "active" when it has moved (that is, gone from
 one place on the battlefield to another) during its last turn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Living Creature Holding Still:</b> A living creature 
has Constitution, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. A creature is holding 
still if it has not moved during its last turn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inanimate Object:</b> An object that's sitting by 
itself. If an object is in motion but staying in place (such as a 
swinging pendulum or a spinning wheel), use the Spot DC for a living 
creature holding still. If the object is actually moving across the 
battlefield (such as an iron ball rolling along or a pendulum swing 
across two or more squares) use the DC for an active creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unliving Creature Holding Still:</b> An unliving 
creature has Wisdom and Charisma scores, but no Constitution score. It 
is holding still when it is not moving, as noted above under Living 
Creature Holding Still.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Completely Immobile Creature:</b> In this case, 
complete immobility refers to a creature that is being careful not to 
move a muscle. It can be a creature that is under paralysis, a hold 
spell, or some other effect that utterly prevents it from acting, so 
that it just sits in place like an inanimate object. A sleeping creature
 might be considered completely immobile if its slumber is deep and 
untroubled (as it would be if the creature is under a magical sleep 
effect). A creature sleeping fitfully should be considered holding 
still.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Invisibility and Hiding</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in the description for the Hide skill, you gain
 a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving and +40 on Hide checks if 
you're not moving.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To make a Hide check at all, you need some sort of 
concealment or cover, and that applies even when you're invisible and 
the creatures trying to spot you can't see invisible things. 
Invisibility gives you total concealment, but spotting something 
invisible carries its own Spot DCs and you can't make yourself harder to
 see without a little extra help from your surroundings.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When making your Hide check, apply all the modifiers 
that normally apply to the check (such as Armor Check penalties and 
penalties for your movement). Perceptive readers will note that you're 
effectively paying a double penalty for moving here because the bonus 
for being invisible is lower and you take a Hide check penalty for that 
movement as well. That, however, is the nature of invisibility in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Any movement makes you easier to spot while you're invisible, 
whereas your speed makes it harder for you to hide and the effect gets 
worse the faster you go.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Listening</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide, </i>you can use hearing to notice an invisible creature (inanimate objects don't make any noise).</p>
<p align="LEFT">To resolve an attempt to hear an invisible creature, 
have the listener make a Listen check opposed by the invisible 
creature's Move Silently check (if the invisible creature has no Move 
Silently ranks it makes an untrained check).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The table below is a modified version of the one included on page 295 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i>
 It includes Move Silently penalties for creature's movement (taken from
 the Move Silently skill description), and modifiers for barriers. Other
 Move Silently modifiers (such as the armor check penalties and 
modifiers for the surface the invisible creatures moves across) are not 
included.</p>
<p align="LEFT">According to the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide,</i> a Listen check to notice or locate an invisible creature is a free action each round.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Listen DC to Notice:</b> If the check is successful, 
you merely know there's something unseen somewhere near you, but you 
don't know where or what direction.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You must repeat the check each turn to keep track of the invisible creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Listen DC to Locate:</b> If the check is successful, 
you know exactly where the invisible thing is (you have pinpointed its 
location), including what square or squares on the battlefield it 
occupies.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You must repeat the check each turn to keep track of the invisible creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Moving at Half Speed:</b> Use this modifier if the 
invisible creature is moving at all and if the distance it moved during 
any single action during its last turn was equal to or less than half 
its current speed. If surface conditions limit its movement, use this 
modifier only if the creature moves no more than half the distance in 
speed that the conditions allow. For example, if the creature has a 
speed of 40, it's moving half speed if it moves 20 feet or less during 
any single action. If the creature is moving over terrain that hampers 
its movement, however, it can move only 20 feet with a single action and
 is considered moving at half speed only if it moves 10 feet or less 
during one of those actions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Moving at Full Speed:</b> Use this modifier if the invisible creature moves at more than half speed, as defined above.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Behind a Door:</b> Use this modifier for any fairly thin barrier that's no thicker or stronger than an iron door.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Behind a Stone Wall:</b> Use this modifier for barriers thicker or stronger than an iron door.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Ways to Deal With Invisible Foes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You don't have to rely on Spot or Listen checks, or on 
magic, to locate and attack an invisible foe. Here are some other 
options.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Probing an Area:</b> You can grope or probe about to 
find an invisible creature as a standard action. To do so, pick two 
5-foot squares that are both adjacent to each other and within your 
melee reach; if you have a natural reach of more than 5 feet, or a reach
 weapon, you can probe squares that aren't adjacent to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> If the squares you probe contain anything you can't 
see, you make a melee touch attack (or attacks if there is more than one
 thing you can't see). There is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. 
If an attack succeeds, you deal no damage but you have successfully 
pinpointed the invisible thing's current location. (If the invisible 
thing moves, you don't know where it is anymore.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because you have to use a standard action to probe for 
unseen things, you usually can't do anything about unseen foes you 
locate (unless they're foolish enough to stay put until your next turn),
 but you can use a free action to relay the foe's location to your 
allies. One effective tactic for a group is to have one member probe 
while everyone else readies actions to attack whatever you find. They 
can also simply delay until the probing character finds something. See 
page 160 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for information on readying and delaying.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Attacked by an Unseen Foe:</b> If a foe you cannot 
see hits you with a melee attack and is adjacent to you at the time, you
 know the foe's location. For this reason, smart foes move right after 
they attack; even a foe that has made a full attack can move after 
attacking by taking 5-foot step (provided it has not already moved 
during its turn).</p>
<p align="LEFT">When an unseen foe hits you with a melee attack from 
more than 5 feet away, you know the general direction from which the 
attack came and that the attack came from more than 5 feet away, but you
 do not know the attacker's location.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Looking For Tracks:</b> Unseen creatures leave 
tracks, and you can track them using the normal tracking rules. 
Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces can give clues to an 
invisible creature's location.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the tracks are very clear and the surface that 
carries them is fairly smooth and unsullied by debris or other tracks, 
you can locate a creature you cannot see by looking at its visible 
tracks; tracks aren't visible, however, unless you can see the surface 
that holds them. For example, it's no good looking for an unseen 
creature's tracks if the battle is taking place during a blizzard and 
you're not entirely sure where the ground ends and sky begins. If the 
battle is taking place in a bright morning when the whole battlefield is
 covered in fresh snow, however, an unseen creature's tracks probably 
will betray its location, at least during the first few rounds of a 
fight (before all the snow becomes thoroughly trampled).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Surfaces or conditions that don't leave clear tracks 
still might give you a bonus (the DM can decide how big) in Spot checks 
to notice or locate unseen creatures. You might get a Spot bonus in 
areas covered with tall grass, undergrowth, dust, or running water 
(assuming the unseen creature is wading and not submerged; see next 
section).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Underwater: </b>An invisible thing underwater 
displaces water, and that creates a visible space that reveals the 
invisible thing's location. The DM might apply this effect under other 
circumstances as well, such as areas of heavy smoke, areas draped with 
lots of dangling things (such as vines, cloth, skeins of rope), heavy 
precipitation, or the like.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Marking an Invisible Creature: </b>Since a visible 
object stays visible when an invisible creature picks it up (at least 
until the invisible creature tucks the object into its clothing), you 
may make an invisible thing visible (or at least reveal its location) by
 dousing it with something visible. My own favorite device for doing 
this is a bag packed with about a pound of flour. You could just as 
easily use ink or paint.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Toss the bag of flour just like a splash weapon. A 
direct hit leaves an invisible creature smeared with flour, which 
reveals the creature's location. An invisible creature caught in the 
flour's splash effect can attempt a Reflex save (DC 20) to avoid getting
 covered with flour. A creature can shed its outer clothing (at least a 
full-round action) and be rid of the flour. Otherwise, it must bathe or 
wait for the flour to wear off on its own (which takes an hour or two in
 dry conditions).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Qualities and Feats Against Unseen Foes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Creatures with the scent ability can sniff out unseen creatures, as noted in the scent description in the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 glossary. The blindsense ability reveals unseen things' locations only.
 Tremorsense reveals unseen creatures' locations, provided that they are
 in contact with the ground.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The blindsight ability effectively negates invisibility.
 (The user can deal with unseen things just as though they were 
visible.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Anyone with the Blind-Fight feat has an improved chance
