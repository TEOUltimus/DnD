<p align="left">Some strange things can happen when corporeal creatures 
attack incorporeal creatures. When incorporeal creatures make full use 
of their incorporeality, even stranger things can happen.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Attacking Incorporeal Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part Three, a corporeal creature has a 50% 
chance to fail when it attacks an incorporeal creature, and it must use a
 magic weapon or some kind of magical attack to have any chance to harm 
the incorporeal creature at all. The failure chance arises from an 
incorporeal creature's intangible nature -- there's simply no telling if
 the attack will prove effective. The failure chance applies even to 
attacks that normally require no attack roll, such as spells and 
supernatural abilities. For example, a <i>lightning bolt</i> or a 
dragon's fiery breath both have a 50% chance to fail when aimed at 
incorporeal creatures. If an attack affects an area that contains 
multiple incorporeal creatures or otherwise affects multiple incorporeal
 creatures, check the failure chance separately for each creature. One 
attack may fail against some incorporeal creatures and succeed against 
others.</p>
<p align="left">The failure chance doesn't apply to nondamaging effects, such as <i>halt undead</i> spells. A nondamaging effect that creates some kind of physical restraint, such as a <i>web</i> or <i>entangle</i> spell, isn't effective against an incorporeal creature. (Force barriers, such as <i>wall of force,</i> still work, though.) Spells or effects that require corporeal targets or subjects, such as <i>implosion</i>, also don't work against incorporeal creatures.</p>
<p align="left">Normally, miss chances do not stack (a <i>blur</i> 
spell's 20% miss chance doesn't stack with the 50% miss chance for being
 completely unseen, for example). In this case, however, you could 
combine the incorporeal miss chance with a miss chance for attacking a 
concealed target because one involves uncertainty about exactly where 
the target is and the other involves an immaterial target that might not
 vulnerable to the attack at all. To stack the miss chances, check the 
miss chance for concealment first, then check the incorporeal miss 
chance; if the attacker fails either miss chance, the attack misses (to 
save time, you might want to check the highest miss chance first, or 
just roll both of them at the same time).</p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part Three, some attacks ignore the incorporeal miss chance. The list includes the following:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Force:</b> Anything with the force descriptor has no miss chance against incorporeal subjects. This includes attacks (such as <i>magic missile</i>) and force barriers (such as <i>wall of force</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Positive Energy: </b>Unfortunately, the game has no 
positive energy descriptor, so you have to study a spell or effect's 
description to find out if it involves positive energy. The cleric's 
ability to turn undead creatures is a positive energy effect. The 
various <i>cure</i> spells also involve positive energy; however, to deliver a <i>cure</i>
 spell you must touch a creature and your touch is not a positive energy
 effect. If you're corporeal, your touch attack has a 50% miss chance 
and if you fail that chance, your touch attack misses and you don't 
deliver the spell (but you're still holding the charge as noted on page 
176 of the<i> Player's Handbook)</i>. If you pass the miss chance, you 
make a melee touch attack against the incorporeal creature and, if you 
hit, you deliver the spell. The rules don't say so, but you use the same
 procedure for any other touch range spell. If your touch attack avoids 
the miss chance, a successful hit delivers the spell to an incorporeal 
recipient, even if the spell is not a positive energy effect.</p>
<p align="left">Mass versions of <i>cure</i> spells, such as <i>mass cure light wounds,</i> that deliver positive energy over a distance, don't have a miss chance against incorporeal creatures. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Negative Energy: </b>The notes for positive energy apply equally to negative energy.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghost Touch Weapons:</b> Weapons with the ghost touch property ignore the incorporeal miss chance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Incorporeal Attackers:</b> Any attack or effect that an incorporeal creature launches ignores the incorporeal miss chance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Holy Water</b></p>
<p align="left">You can splash an incorporeal undead creature with holy water to damage it, but the attack has a 50% miss chance. The <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 says you must be adjacent to an incorporeal creature to use holy water 
against it. There's no reason, however, why you couldn't use the rules 
for splash weapons. Just aim the holy water at a grid intersection near 
the creature as noted on page 158 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. This 
trick works only if the incorporeal creature is adjacent to the grid 
intersection you choose and if it is not getting total cover from a 
corporeal creature or object (see Combat Tactics for Incorporeal 
Creatures).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special Attacks</b></p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature's lack of a physical body makes 
certain special attacks moot. For example, a corporeal creature can't 
bull rush or overrun an incorporeal creature (but it could try to move 
into its space; see Using Creatures as Cover). A corporeal creature also
 cannot trip an incorporeal creature.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Armor Classes for Incorporeal Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature has a base Armor Class of 10, 
just as any other creature does. The creature's size and Dexterity score
 also affects an incorporeal creature's Armor Class in the usual way. An
 incorporeal creature also has a deflection bonus to Armor Class, which 
is equal to its Charisma modifier, but is always at least +1. This 
represents the effect that the incorporeal creature's real but 
nonphysical presence has on the battlefield.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghost Touch Armor </b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Ghost touch</i> armor provides a corporeal creature 
with its full armor bonus (armor bonus from the armor's kind plus the 
armor's enhancement bonus) against incorporeal touch attacks (but not 
regular touch attacks). For example, a dwarf wearing <i>+2 ghost touch half-plate</i>
 gains the +2 enhancement bonus from the armor and the +7 armor bonus 
from the half-plate against a spectre's incorporeal touch attack.</p>
<p align="left">When an incorporeal creature wears ghost touch armor, 
things are little different. Only the armor's enhancement bonus applies 
to the creature's Armor Class; the basic armor bonus from the armor does
 not apply. For example, a spectre wearing <i>+2 ghost touch half-plate</i>
 gains only the +2 enhancement bonus from the armor and does not benefit
 from the armor +7 armor bonus. The +2 enhancement bonus from the ghost 
touch<i></i>armor is an armor bonus. It applies against incorporeal 
touch attacks, but not against other kinds of touch attacks (such as 
rays or touch-range spells).</p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature wearing ghost touch armor 
remains incorporeal and the normal miss chance applies to most attacks 
made against it. An attack with a<i></i>ghost touch weapon must contend with the ghost touch armor's enhancement bonus, but not with the base armor, as noted above.</p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature wearing<i></i>ghost touch<i></i>armor
 isn't actually carrying the armor around -- it just floats along with 
the creature. The armor is effectively weightless when an incorporeal 
creature wears it. The armor does not encumber the incorporeal creature,
 and the armor's Dexterity cap does not apply. The spectre wearing <i>+2 ghost touch half-plate</i> from our previous example has an Armor Class of 17 (+3 Dex, +2 deflection, +2 armor).</p>
<p align="left">If you're uncomfortable with the foregoing text and you 
would like the ghost touch armor to work pretty much the same way no 
matter who wears it, you need to figure out how a creature with no 
physical body and no Strength score wears armor and you also need to 
figure out its encumbrance. A fairly easy way to handle this is to use 
the incorporeal creature's Charisma score as its Strength score for 
purposes of determining the creature's load. The rules say that a 
creature cannot fly when carrying more than a light load, but you may 
want to waive that rule for incorporeal creatures (which often have only
 a flying speed). You also may want to give an incorporeal wearer the 
full benefit of the base armor's armor bonus and apply the appropriate 
speed reductions and Dexterity cap for the base armor.</p>
<p align="left">No matter what rules you use for an incorporeal wearer, 
an incorporeal creature wearing ghost touch armor retains its ability to
 pass though solid objects and all the special defenses that go along 
with being incorporeal.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Combat Tactics for Incorporeal Creatures </b></p>
<p align="left">Even a dull-witted incorporeal creature should know 
enough to use these combat tricks when fighting corporeal creatures. The
 notes in this section were drawn in part from the upcoming <i>Libris Mortis</i> tome from Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Staying Mobile: </b>Thanks to their flying speeds and
 ability to pass through (or at least enter) corporeal objects or 
creatures, incorporeal creatures enjoy unmatched mobility no matter what
 conditions prevail on battlefield. In fact, the more cramped or choked 
with obstacles a battle proves, the greater an incorporeal creature's 
advantage in mobility over a corporeal foe. An incorporeal creature 
should move around frequently. When it does so, it should take the 
shortest available route between two points, which might take it through
 solid objects. Even when an incorporeal creature cannot move straight 
through an object because the object is thicker than the creature's 
face, it usually can cut corners by entering the object briefly.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Objects as Cover:</b> An incorporeal creature's
 ability to pass through (or at least enter) corporeal objects or 
creatures can prove most exasperating to corporeal foes. In general, an 
incorporeal creature can claim cover whenever it enters an object that's
 the same size category that it is or one size category larger. If the 
incorporeal creature enters an object at least two size categories 
larger than itself, it has total cover. If, however, the incorporeal 
creature makes a melee attack outside the larger object's space, it only
 has cover unless it can retreat back into the object after the attack. 
For example, if an incorporeal creatures makes a melee attack, then uses
 a 5-foot step to enter an object at least two sizes bigger than it is, 
the incorporeal creature has total cover. If the incorporeal creature 
instead leaves or reaches out of the same object and then attacks, it 
cannot take a 5-foot step and gains only cover from the object. In 
either case, the incorporeal creature only has cover while it makes the 
melee attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Using Creatures as Cover:</b> An incorporeal creature
 can move through corporeal creatures as well as objects. Likewise, a 
corporeal can move through an incorporeal creature.</p>
<p align="left">When trying to move through a creature, you provoke an 
attack of opportunity from that creature when you enter its space. To 
actually enter the other creature's body, you must make a successful 
touch attack (or incorporeal touch attack) against the other creature. 
This represents the difficulties involved in actually slipping into the 
other creature's body. If the attack fails, you must go back to the last
 space you left. Attempting to move into the other creature's space 
counts against your movement for the turn, but going back a space does 
not.</p>
<p align="left">A creature threatens its own space, so you provoke an attack of opportunity when leaving its space.</p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature inside a corporeal creature 
gains cover as noted above. When an incorporeal creature uses a 
corporeal creature for cover, that cover lasts only so long as the two 
creatures share the same space. If either the incorporeal creature or 
the corporeal creature moves away from the shared space, there's no more
 cover.</p>
<p align="left">When an incorporeal creature is the same size or one 
size larger than a corporeal creature whose space it shares, the 
corporeal creature gains concealment. If the incorporeal creature is two
 or more sizes larger, the corporeal creature has total concealment. 
However, if the corporeal creature reaches outside the incorporeal 
creature's space to make a melee attack, it has only concealment unless 
it can retreat back into the incorporeal creature's space afterward as 
noted above.</p>
<p align="left">You normally could enter the other creature's space due to a difference in size (see page 149 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>);
 no touch attack is required. No touch attack is required to simply move
 through an ally's space or a helpless creature's space. If you don't 
make the touch attack and succeed, however, you don't get concealment or
 cover from the other creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Force Effects: </b>A force effect that completely surrounds the user's body, such as the <i>mage armor</i> spell or <i>bracers of armor</i>,
 prevents an incorporeal creature from occupying the user's space and 
vice versa, though two creatures' relative sizes might still allow them 
to share the same space, as noted above.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Incorporeal Combat Miscellany </b></p>
<p align="left">Remember that incorporeal creatures cannot see through 
solid objects. When an incorporeal creature claims total cover from an 
object (or creature), it cannot see anything and is effectively blinded.</p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature can make a Listen check to 
locate corporeal creatures it cannot see (see Part Two). It gains a +2 
bonus on Listen checks when inside a solid object.</p>
<p align="left">If you're playing an incorporeal creature in combat 
against corporeal foes, make sure you don't act on information that the 
incorporeal creature doesn't have. It's pretty difficult, for example, 
for an incorporeal creature hiding inside a wall or floor to emerge in 
exactly the right spot to attack round after round (unless the corporeal
 foes are foolish enough to stay in one place, or are compelled to do 
so). In most cases, the incorporeal creature will make a Listen check 
and determine a corporeal creature's location. After that, the 
incorporeal creature will have to emerge at least partly from the object
 where it is hiding to make an attack.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Incorporeal Against Incorporeal </b></p>
<p align="left">Incorporeal creatures can interact physically with each 
other -- at least as much as that is possible for creatures that lack 
physical bodies. They can attack each other without an incorporeal miss 
chance and they can attempt certain special attacks against each other, 
as noted here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Grappling:</b> You can resolve grapple attempts using the rules on pages 155-157 of the <i>Player's Handbook,</i>
 except that an incorporeal creature uses its Charisma modifier instead 
of its Strength modifier when it makes a grapple check. Remember that 
grappling combat begins with an initial grab attempt, not a grapple 
check. When one incorporeal creature tries to grab another, it makes a 
melee touch attack and uses its Dexterity modifier for the attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Overrun:</b> When one incorporeal creature tries to 
overrun another, use the attacker's Charisma modifier for the opposed 
check. The defender can use its Charisma modifier or its Dexterity 
modifier. Incorporeal creatures can't fall, so it's best to assume that 
they can't be knocked prone if they fail an opposed check. Instead, just
 assume that the loser is moved 5 feet in a direction of the winner's 
choosing; this doesn't count as part of the loser's movement. If a 
barrier that is impassable to an incorporeal creature prevents movement 
in the direction the winner chose, it must choose a different direction.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trip:</b> Although one incorporeal creature can grab 
another, you can't make an incorporeal creature fall down, even if 
you're incorporeal yourself.</p>
