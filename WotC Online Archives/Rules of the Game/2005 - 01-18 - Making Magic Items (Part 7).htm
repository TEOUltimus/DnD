<p align="left">Okay, you've finally written out a description for your 
item. Now it's time to figure out what the item costs. This week, we'll 
consider that problem and conclude this particular subject!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Base Price and Market Price </b></p>
<p align="left">The rules offer you some help in this endeavor, but ultimately your own good judgment will prove the best guide.</p>
<p align="left">Assigning a market price to a magic item is covered in detail in Chapter 7 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide. </i>See Table 7-33. Items that provide simple <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonuses</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attacks</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throws</a>, or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_check')">checks</a> are fairly easy to evaluate.</p>
<p align="left">If your item doesn't provide any bonuses and has no 
clear spell analogy, try comparing it against similar items. If that's 
not helpful, consider the question of when you think it would be 
appropriate for a PC to have one of your items. Should he have it at 7th
 level? According to Table 5-1: Character Wealth by Level in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>,
 a 7th-level PC is assumed to have 19,000 gp of gear. A reasonable cost 
for a single item that such a character might own would be somewhere 
between 10% and 40% of the character's total wealth. In this case, 
that's 1,900 gp to 7,600 gp.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weapons, Armor, and Shields: </b>Many weapon or armor
 qualities are not assigned a market price in cash, but they are instead
 priced as "+1 bonus", "+2 bonus," and so on. This was discussed in Part
 Four.</p>
<p align="left">You can use this system when the property directly affects the offense (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hit')">hit</a> chance or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>
 dealt) of a weapon, or the defense (likelihood of a hit or damage 
received) of an armor. Otherwise, your new weapon property should be 
priced as a no-slot item. For example, <i>armor of Strength +4 </i>shouldn't
 be priced as a +2 or +3 armor bonus; instead it should be priced as a 
+4 ability enhancement (+16,000 gp), doubled to +32,000 gp because it 
doesn't use up any item slots (see Table 7-33).</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Some Things to Avoid </b></p>
<p align="left">Keep in mind that the rules and advice in Chapter 7 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 are intended to help a reasonable person estimate what an item is worth
 in play. It's always a mistake to try to create the most powerful item 
possible for the lowest possible price or vice versa.</p>
<p align="left"><b>When the Formulas Fail: </b>Table 7-33 provides the 
basic tool for determining item prices and costs, but many items don't 
fit the table. Many spells in the game work fine as spells, but spells 
come with built-in limits on their power, and chief among those is the 
simple fact that a spell is used up when cast and a character has only 
so many spells available each day. Many spells become world beaters when
 they're placed in items that work continuously or in items that can be 
reused over and over again. For example, a <i>ring of invisibility</i> 
is a command-activated item that duplicates a 2nd-level spell, and its 
caster level is 3rd (the minimum to cast the spell). According to Table 
7-33, such an item has a cost of 2 x 3 x 1,800 gp (spell level x caster x
 1,800 gp). So, a <i>ring of invisibility</i> costs 10,800 gp, right? Wrong, it costs nearly twice that much (20,000 gp) because an endless supply of <i>invisibility</i> spells are worth something extra.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Use the Correct Formula:</b> One item people frequently ask me about is a <i>ring of</i><i>true strike.</i> The spell provides a whopping +20 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_insightbonus')">insight bonus</a> on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack rolls</a> and negates <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_misschance')">miss chances</a>
 arising from concealed targets. It's only 1st level, however, because 
it is a personal range spell with a duration of 1 round. That means you 
can normally manage one attack every 2 rounds when using the spell. 
Also, you can't bestow it on an ally (except for a familiar or animal 
companion) because of its personal range.</p>
<p align="left">Assuming such a ring worked whenever it was needed and 
has a caster level of 1st, it would cost a mere 2,000 gp by the formula 
for a use-activated spell effect (in this case, 1 x 1 x 2,000 gp). 
Sharp-eyed readers will note that any continuously functioning item has a
 cost adjustment of x4 (see the footnotes to Table 7-33), which bumps up
 the ring's cost to 8,000 gp. That's a real bargain for an item that 
provides so much boost to a user's combat power. Much too great a 
bargain.</p>
<p align="left">So, what would our example <i>ring of true strike</i> be
 worth? Insight bonuses aren't included on Table 7-33, but a weapon 
bonus has a cost equal to the bonus squared x 2,000 gp, so a +20 weapon 
would cost 800,000 gp. One can argue that the ring isn't quite as good 
as a +20 weapon because it doesn't provide a damage bonus. That, 
however, ignores the very potent ability to negate most miss chances. 
Also, the ring's insight bonus works with any sort of attack the wearer 
makes. On top of all that, the insight bonus stacks with any enhancement
 bonus from a magic weapon the wearer might wield. Still, 800,000 gp is a
 lot of cash and the lack of a damage bonus is significant, so some 
price reduction is in order. A 50% reduction might be in order, or 
400,000 gp for the ring.</p>
<p align="left">Would you pay 400,000 gp for a <i>ring of true striking?</i> I would if I could afford it. At a price of 400,000 gp, our mythical <i>ring of true strike</i> is something only an epic-level character could afford. That's fine, because epic play is where the ring belongs.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Items With Multiple Powers </b></p>
<p align="left">The sidebar on page 282 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> causes a great deal of trouble. Here are a few tips to make the advice in the sidebar work for you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Multiple Similar Abilities Versus Multiple Different Abilities:</b>
 An item with multiple similar abilities costs much less than an item 
with multiple different abilities, so what's the difference? In this 
case, "similar" abilities are functions that draw from the same pool of 
charges, or that can't be used at the same time (or at least don't 
provide a great deal of extra benefit if they are used together), or all
 of the above. Sometimes, an item has powers that receive this similar 
abilities price reduction when the item's multiple powers work together 
to produce an overall effect, or when an item's powers must be activated
 separately, but that's fairly rare.</p>
<p align="left">A staff is a great example of an item whose multiple 
powers are priced as "similar" abilities. Refer to Part Three for notes 
on pricing staffs. Remember, however, that all a staff's powers must 
have the same caster level; for an item that has a different caster 
level for different powers, be sure to charge full price for the most 
expensive power, 75% for the next most expensive power, and 50% for all 
other powers.</p>
<p align="left">An item has multiple different abilities when they do 
not draw from the same pool of charges or otherwise don't interfere with
 each other. Usually, such powers must be activated separately. Most 
rods are good examples of this kind of item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Slotless Powers:</b> According to Table 7-33, an item
 that doesn't take up space on the user's body has double the normal 
price. In many cases, it's appropriate to levy this extra cost when an 
item has multiple powers, especially when one power works continuously 
or the item's multiple powers tend to reinforce each other in play. The 
weapon that also bestows a Strength boost from an earlier example is a 
good example of this kind of item.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Item Pricing Examples </b></p>
<p align="left">The best way to learn item pricing is to practice, so here are some examples taken from this very site:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bracers of Brachiation:</b> The slim <i>bracers of brachiation</i> grant the wearer a climb speed of 20 feet in forested areas. The user gains a +8 racial bonus on all <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_movementmodes')">Climb</a> checks, and it can always choose to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_take10')">take 10</a>,
 even if rushed or threatened while climbing. In addition, while using 
its climb speed to move in forested areas, the creature gains a +2 
insight bonus on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiativecheck')">initiative checks</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_reflexsave')">Reflex saving throws</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>spider climb,</i> creator must have at least 10 ranks in Climb; Price 18,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.</p>
<p align="left">The items were priced as follows:</p>
<p align="left">+8 skill bonus = 6,400 (bonus squared x 100 gp). The 
skill bonus is limited to forested areas, and that would argue for a 
reduction, but the bracers also grant a climb speed of 20 feet in 
forested areas, so we'll leave this price alone.</p>
<p align="left">+2 insight bonus on Reflex saves = 4,000 gp. A save 
bonus other than a resistance bonus is worth the bonus squared x 2,000 
gp, or 8,000 gp according to Table 7-33. This one, however, is limited 
to Reflex saves made in forested areas, so we'll reduce that by half to 
4,000 gp.</p>
<p align="left">The +2 initiative bonus in woods is worth at least as much as the save bonus, 4,000 gp.</p>
<p align="left">This is a multifunction item, so the cheaper functions have a price multiplier of x 1.5.</p>
<p align="left">That makes the market price (and base price) 6,400 gp + 
6,000 (4,000 x 1.5) + 6,000 (4,000 x 1.5) = 18,400. The monetary cost to
 create is 9,200 gp (half the base price); the XP cost to create is 736 
XP (1/25th the base cost).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Figurine of Wondrous Power (Limestone Crab):</b> A <i>limestone crab </i>appears as a miniature statuette, often badly eroded, of a crab. When the <i>figurine</i>
 is tossed down and the correct command word is spoken, it becomes a 
living monstrous crab. The monstrous crab obeys and serves its owner; it
 understands Common but does not speak. The monstrous crab can serve as a
 beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant as its owner desires. Unlike a
 normal monstrous crab, the <i>limestone crab</i> retains some of the qualities of stone when animated and has <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hardness')">hardness</a> 3. A <i>limestone crab</i> can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use.</p>
<p align="left">If a <i>limestone crab</i> is broken or destroyed in its
 statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost -- its power 
departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a 
statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p>
<p align="left">A <i>limestone crab</i> always feels damp to the touch, as if it had just been plucked from a tide pool.</p>
<p align="left">Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <i>animate objects</i>, <i>stoneskin</i>; Price 10,000 gp.</p>
<p align="left">No spell is analogous to what this item does (though the <i>animate objects</i> spell comes close). However, plenty of other figurines of wondrous power are in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. A <i>limestone crab</i> is about as tough as a griffon (see the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fw/20040221a">Far Corners of the World feature</a> for monstrous crab stats), so pricing equals the bronze griffon figurine of 10,000 gp.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>A Completely Unofficial Rule: Cooperative Item Creation </b></p>
<p align="left">As noted back in Part One, more than one character can 
cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing 
one or more of the prerequisites. According to the rules, however, XP 
costs cannot be shared. One character must shoulder the XP burden alone.</p>
<p align="left">If players in your game are avid magic item creators, 
you might want to experiment with shared XP costs. You can allow 
characters who work together on a magic item to divide up the XP cost 
any way they like. To share the cost, a character must provide at least 
one of the item's prerequisites. Any division of the XP cost is 
possible, provided that all the creators agree to the scheme.</p>
<p align="left">If you have the kind of campaign in which some of your 
players pester the others to make magic items for them, you might want 
to allow any character to share the XP cost to make an item. An XP donor
 must be present each day during the item's creation (or at least when 
work begins on the item each day). Allow the XP donation to be strictly 
voluntary -- it doesn't work if the donor is magically charmed or 
compelled, or if the donor is bullied or intimidated into contributing. 
On the other hand, allowing evil spellcasters to force XP from unwilling
 victims might just add the right touch of nastiness to dark fantasy 
campaigns.</p>
