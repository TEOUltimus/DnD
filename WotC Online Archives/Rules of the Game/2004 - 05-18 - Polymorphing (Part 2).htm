<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>The <i>Alter Self</i> Spell</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The spell <i>alter self</i> provides the baseline for all other polymorph effects in the game. Once you understand how <i>alter self </i>works, you're well on your way to understanding how any similar effect works. Here are the essential features of the <i>alter self </i>spell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal range spell with a target entry of "you."<br><br> You can't use <i>alter self </i>to
 change anyone or anything other than yourself. If you have a familiar, 
mount, or other companion with the share spells ability, you can change 
both yourself and your familiar or companion. Your familiar or companion
 must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the effect, and
 it stops affecting the familiar or companion if it moves farther than 5
 feet away and will not affect the familiar or companion again even if 
it returns to you before the spell's duration expires. You choose a form
 for yourself and for your familiar or companion. The forms you choose 
don't have to be the same. In fact, in most cases, they cannot be the 
same because <i>alter self</i> allows the subject to assume a form of the same type as itself only (see the next point).<br><br></li>
<li>The form you assume must be a creature of the same type as yours.<br><br>
 You can't use this spell to assume the form of an object, or of any 
kind of creature type other than your own. There's no limit to the 
subtypes you can assume, so long as the base type is the same as your 
own. For example if you're a human, your type and subtype is humanoid 
(human), so you can assume the form of any other humanoid creature, such
 as an orc, goblin, dwarf, or elf. Note that the monstrous humanoid type
 is different from the humanoid type. If you're a human, you can't use <i>alter self</i> to assume the form of a monstrous humanoid creature such as a sahuagin or minotaur.<br><br> When you share an <i>alter self</i>
 spell with a familiar or companion, the familiar or companion assumes a
 form of the same type as its own. While an animal becomes a magical 
beast upon becoming a familiar, such a creature must assume the form of 
an animal when sharing an <i>alter self</i> spell. For example, a cat familiar is a magical beast; when it shares an <i>alter self</i> spell, it assumes the form of an animal, such as a dog, a bird or a bat, not the form of a magical beast.<br><br></li>
<li>You remain in your assumed form until the spell ends.<br><br> The 
spell is dismissible; if you are the spellcaster, you can end the spell 
during your turn with a standard action that does not provoke an attack 
of opportunity. If you share the spell with a familiar or companion, the
 recipient cannot dismiss the effect, though the effect still ends for 
the familiar or companion if it moves farther than 5 feet away from you.<br><br></li>
<li> The form you assume can't have Hit Dice of more than your caster level, to a maximum of 5 Hit Dice.<br><br>
 A form's Hit Dice refers to its racial Hit Dice -- the Hit Dice it has 
before adding any class levels. See the assumed form's creature 
description (in the <i>Monster Manual</i> or other publication) for its Hit Dice. In some cases, the limit of 5 Hit Dice might keep you from using <i>alter self</i> to assume the form of your own kind. For example, if you're a spellcasting stone giant, you technically cannot use <i>alter self</i>
 to assume the form of another stone giant because stone giants have 14 
Hit Dice. As an unofficial rule of thumb, you should always be able to 
use <i>alter self</i> to assume the form of your own kind.<br><br></li>
<li> The assumed form you choose must have a size that is within one size category of your own.<br><br> Even if the form you choose falls within the spell's Hit Dice limit, its size might preclude you from assuming that form with <i>alter self.</i>
 If you're size Medium yourself, you can assume forms of Small, Medium, 
or Large size only. If you're size Small, you can assume forms of Tiny, 
Small, or Medium size only<br><br></li>
<li>You retain your own ability scores when in your assumed form.<br><br> You might appear strong or agile in your assumed form, but none of your ability scores change when you use the <i>alter self</i> spell. <br><br></li>
<li>You retain your class and level, hit points, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses when in your assumed form.<br><br> You're still your same old self -- just in body that has changed superficially. Though not specifically mentioned in the <i>alter self</i> spell description, you also retain everything else that your class and level gives you, including skill ranks and feats. <br><br></li>
<li>You retain the supernatural and spell-like special attacks and 
qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part 
that the new form does not have.<br><br> As noted in Part One, you lose 
breath weapons if the assumed form doesn't have a mouth, and you lose 
gaze attacks if your assumed form doesn't have eyes.<br><br></li>
<li> You retain all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels.<br><br>
 As noted in Part One, extraordinary special attacks or qualities from 
class levels are primarily a function of the mind (you acquired them 
through experience and training), so you can keep right on using them 
when you're in an assumed form.<br><br></li>
<li> You lose extraordinary special attacks and qualities not derived from class levels.<br><br>
 Also as noted in Part One, extraordinary special attacks and qualities 
are assumed to be largely a function of your body. When you change your 
body with the <i>alter self</i> spell, you lose the special physical adaptations that make those extraordinary special attacks and qualities.<br><br></li>
<li>You retain your ability to speak if your assumed form has that ability.<br><br>
 Speech is a natural ability (see Part One); however speech has a mental
 aspect (your brain's ability to handle language) and a physical aspect 
(working vocal apparatus). You have to have both to speak in an assumed 
form. Furthermore, your assumed form must be able to speak naturally. If
 you assume the form of a creature that cannot speak or use language 
during the normal course of its life, you still lose the ability to 
speak. This distinction doesn't often come up with the <i>alter self</i> spell (because it doesn't let you assume a form with a type different than your own), but it can with other polymorph effects.<br><br></li>
<li>You retain your spellcasting abilities, but your assumed form might limit what you can do.<br><br>
 You can use spells with verbal components only if you have retained the
 ability to speak. You can use somatic and material components only if 
your assumed form has limbs capable of dealing with them. <br><br></li>
<li>You have the physical qualities of the assumed form.<br><br> 
Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities 
(such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings. 
Physical qualities also include natural armor bonus, natural weapons 
(such as claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus 
feats, and any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, 
number of extremities, and so forth).<br><br> Your size becomes the same
 as a typical example of the creature whose form you assume, as noted in
 the creature's description. You cannot assume a larger or smaller size 
even if the creature's advancement entry lists other possible sizes. If 
for example, you change into a lizardfolk, you become Medium size -- you
 could not turn into a Small or Large lizardfolk.<br><br> Your maximum 
speed in any assumed form, however, is 120 feet for flying or 60 feet 
for nonflying movement; faster speeds are considered extraordinary 
qualities, even when they are not so listed in the creature's 
description. In most cases, racial skill bonuses depend on your body and
 your mind. So, you get to keep your own racial skill bonuses and feats 
while gaining those of your assumed form. Your DM might want to make 
certain exceptions. (For example, a dwarf's skill bonuses related to 
stonework are arguably cultural in origin and don't just appear when 
you're in dwarf form.)<br><br></li>
<li>A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.<br><br>
 Many DMs and players find this rule puzzling. Essentially, it means 
that if you suddenly find yourself with two extra arms you can't just 
pick up four weapons and wade into melee, use a four-handed weapon, fire
 and reload a heavy crossbow (even a repeating heavy crossbow) in the 
same round, or perform any other combat tricks that come to mind. You 
can make attacks that are "normal" for you or normal for your assumed 
form, but you can't combine them.<br><br></li>
<li>You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special 
qualities not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, 
low-light vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, 
scent, and so forth.<br><br> Your new body might look and feel like the genuine article, but it's not the genuine article.<br><br></li>
<li>You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities,
 or spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype
 (if any) remain the same regardless of your new form.<br><br> By and large, you remain yourself, but you occupy a slightly different body.<br><br></li>
<li>You cannot take the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't change the creature type or subtype.<br><br> When you choose a form to assume, you're limited to a typical specimen of that form. <br><br></li>
<li>You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities 
(such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal 
ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical 
qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your 
control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. As
 a rule of thumb you can vary the assumed form's weight or dimensions up
 or down by 10% unless a greater variation is allowed among typical 
specimens. For example, if you assume the form of an elf or halfling, 
you can choose any height allowed on Table 6-6 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.<br><br></li>
<li>You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's
 race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus 
on your Disguise check.<br><br> To any casual viewer, you are a typical 
specimen of the kind of creature whose form you have assumed. If someone
 is paying close attention to you, the character can attempt a Spot 
check to note something odd about your appearance, as noted in the 
description of the Disguise skill. Use the +10 modifier on your Disguise
 check rather than the modifiers shown on the first table in the skill 
description. The Disguise check you make reflects how accurately you 
have reproduced your assumed form. If you use <i>alter self</i> to 
masquerade as a particular individual, anyone studying you might also 
get a Spot bonus as noted in the Disguise skill description.<br><br></li>
<li>When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn 
or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the 
item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.<br><br> Since <i>alter self</i>
 allows you to assume forms only with a type the same as your own, you 
usually can count on keeping your equipment functioning. If a piece of 
your equipment winds up subsumed into your new form, it's temporarily 
nonfunctional, but it's unharmed. When you revert to your true form, any
 objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same 
location on your body they previously occupied and are once again 
functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in
 your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could 
wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms at the 
time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body 
or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its 
true form.</li>

<p align="LEFT">In lizardfolk form, Anlion's statistics don't change 
much. He gains the lizardfolk's natural armor, natural weaponry, and 
racial skill bonuses. He loses his low-light vision (an extraordinary 
special quality). He retains his half-elf racial skill bonuses. He also 
gains the lizardfolk's racial skill bonuses to Balance, Jump, and Swim
