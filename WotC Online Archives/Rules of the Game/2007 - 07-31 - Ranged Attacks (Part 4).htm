<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2007-31%20-%20Ranged%20Attacks%20%28Part%204%29_files/dx20070710_cover.jpg" border="1" height="285" width="285"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Two orcs (O1 and O2) face a pixie (P) and a satyr (S) 
across a stone wall about 3 feet high. The wall is tall enough to cover 
the pixie from head to toe, blocking all ranged attacks from the orcs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The low wall gives the satyr cover against ranged 
attacks from the orc 1 on the left. Orc 2 on the right, however, is 
closer to the low wall than the satyr, and the satyr gains no cover from
 the wall against that orc's ranged attacks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">You can gain cover from anything that can block a ranged
 attack, such as a low wall, the corner of a building, a bush, or even 
another character.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes something that provides cover seems to fill a whole <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_square')">square</a>
 (or side of a square), but really doesn't. Such things might include 
low walls that cover a target's lower half only, creatures (which tend 
to move around within their squares), or a bush (which might have plenty
 of gaps that could allow a projectile to pass through). In these cases,
 the barrier provides cover that a projectile must pass through to reach
 the target.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Low barriers (those that cover only the lower half of 
the target) provide cover only when the target is within 30 feet of the 
low barrier and the attacker is not closer to the barrier than the 
defender; see page 151 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the diagram provided here.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a solid barrier can cover a target's full height, 
it blocks all ranged attacks unless it blocks only part of the target. 
To determine if the target has cover in a case of partial blocking, 
trace lines from any of corner of the attacker's space to all corner of 
the defender's space. If at least one of these lines intersects the 
barrier, but not all of them do, the target has cover against the attack
 and gains a +4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the target occupies more than one space, the target 
gets the benefit of cover against a ranged attack if any square it 
occupies is protected by cover, even if some squares it occupies aren't.
 This helps offset the defender's size penalty to Armor Class and it 
reflects some of the inherent difficulties a ranged attacker faces. </p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From pages 150-152 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>COVER</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One of the best defenses available is cover. By taking 
cover behind a tree, a wall, the side of a wagon, or the battlements of a
 castle, you can protect yourself from attacks, especially ranged 
attacks, and also from being spotted. To determine whether your target 
has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If 
any line from this corner to any corner of the target's square passes 
through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover,
 or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to
 AC).</p>
<p align="LEFT">When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, 
your target has cover if any line from your square to the target's 
square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee 
attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you (such as with a reach
 weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Low Obstacles and Cover: </b>A low obstacle (such as a
 wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to 
creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the 
cover if he's closer to the obstacle than his target.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cover and Attacks of Opportunity:</b> You can't execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cover and Reflex Saves:</b> Cover grants you a +2 
bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a
 point on the other side of the cover from you, such as a red dragon's 
breath weapon or a <i>lightning bolt. </i>Note that spread effects (see page 175), such as a <i>fireball, </i>can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cover and Hide Checks: </b>You can use cover to make a Hide check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Hide check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Soft Cover:</b> Creatures, even your enemies, can 
provide you with cover against melee attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to 
AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does
 soft cover allow you to make a Hide check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Big Creatures and Cover:</b> Any creature with a 
space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee 
attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature 
can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has 
cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack 
against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to 
determine if it has cover against you.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Total Cover:</b> If you don't have line of effect to 
your target (for instance, if he is completely behind a high wall), he 
is considered to have total cover from you. You can't make an attack 
against a target that has total cover.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Varying Degrees of Cover:</b> In some cases, cover 
may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. For instance, a 
character peering around a corner or through an arrow slit has even 
better cover than a character standing behind a low wall or an obstacle.
 In such situations, the DM can double the normal cover bonuses to AC 
and Reflex saves (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this 
improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to 
which the Reflex save bonus applies (see the improved evasion ability in
 the rogue class description, page 51). Furthermore, improved cover 
provides a +10 bonus on Hide checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The DM may impose other penalties or restrictions to 
attacks depending on the details of the cover. For example, to strike 
effectively through a narrow opening, you need to use a long piercing 
weapon, such as an arrow or a spear. A battleaxe or a pick just isn't 
going to get through an arrow slit.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Shooting Into a Melee</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Firing into a melee is a difficult proposition because 
melee combatants do a great deal of bobbing and weaving. When you shoot 
into a melee, you take a -4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalty</a> on your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack roll</a> because you must be very careful where you shoot to avoid hitting an ally.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 140 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shooting or Throwing into a Melee:</b> If you shoot 
or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly 
character, you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you have to
 aim carefully to avoid hitting your friend. Two characters are engaged 
in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the 
other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not 
considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">If your target (or the part of your target you're aiming
 at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest 
friendly character, you can avoid the -4 penalty, even if the creature 
you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Precise Shot: </i>If you have the Precise Shot feat (page 98), you don't take this penalty.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">As noted on page 140 of the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> 
creatures are in melee when they're enemies and either creature 
threatens the other. An unconscious or immobilized creature isn't 
considered to be in melee unless it's actually being attacked.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If your target is at least 10 feet from your allies (as 
it might be if it has more than 5 feet of melee reach), you don't take 
the penalty. If your target occupies more than one space, you can avoid 
the penalty by aiming your ranged attack at a part of your target that 
is at least 10 feet from your nearest ally -- it's easier to find a safe
 shot when shooting into a melee than to shoot around cover.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you must shoot through an ally's (or enemy's) space 
to hit your target, your target gains cover from the intervening 
creature (+4 bonus to Armor Class). The target's Armor Class improvement
 applies in addition to the penalty you take for shooting into a melee.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Precise Shot feat allows you to fire into melee without penalty.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Magical Effects as Ranged Attacks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Rules and feats that apply to ranged attacks can apply to things other than projectile or thrown weapons, as noted here.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spells:</b> Any <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>
 that requires you to make a ranged attack roll to aim the spell is 
subject to all the rules that govern ranged attacks, including most 
feats that improve ranged attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> All spells that produce rays fall into this category. 
Other spells that have effect entries and produce effects that you throw
 or otherwise propel away from you also count as ranged attacks, 
provided that you actually use the effect at range. (See <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a"><i>Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</i></a>) and page 175 in <i>the Player's Handbook</i> for a discussion of effect spells.) Other spells might also work as ranged attacks; check the spell's description to be sure.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 175 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Effect:</b> Some spells, such as <i>summon monster </i>spells,
 create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already 
present. You must designate the location where these things are to 
appear, either by seeing it or defining it (for example, "The <i>insect plague </i>will
 appear 20 feet into the area of darkness that the nagas are hiding 
in"). Range determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the 
effect is mobile (a summoned monster, for instance), it can move 
regardless of the spell's range.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Ray: </i>Some effects are rays (for example, <i>ray of enfeeblement</i>).
 You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a 
ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged
 weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope
 you hit something. You don't have to see the creature you're trying to 
hit, as you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and 
obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide cover for 
the creature you're aiming at.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a ray spell has a duration, it's the duration of the 
effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself 
persists. If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just
 as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a 
natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Spread: </i>Some effects, notably clouds and fogs, 
spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid intersection. 
The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can't see. 
Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns 
the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread effects, 
count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace 
diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for 
such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all 
portions of the effect. Example: <i>obscuring mist.</i></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Spells with area entries never function as ranged 
attacks, nor do most spells that have target entries (unless you must 
make a ranged attack to hit the target).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes a spell works as a ranged attack, and sometimes it doesn't, depending on how you use the spell. For example, the <i>produce flame</i> spell is an effect spell that you can use for either melee or ranged combat. <i>Produce flame</i> counts as a ranged attack only when you're hurling flames.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Other Magical Effects: </b>Any magical effect that you aim at a single target and that requires you to make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattackroll')">ranged attack roll</a> to hit your target also counts as a ranged attack. For example, the warlock's <i>eldritch blast</i> power from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/179250000">Complete Arcane</a></i> functions as a ranged attack. If you use a blast shape invocation to change your <i>eldritch blast</i>
 so that it covers an area (such as eldritch cone), it no longer 
functions as a ranged attack -- the modification makes the blast work 
more like an area spell. </p>
