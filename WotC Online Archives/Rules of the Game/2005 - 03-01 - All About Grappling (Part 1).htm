<p align="left">Many a <b>D&amp;D</b><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a> has gone down to defeat while writhing in an opponent's grasp. Unfortunately, many a <b>D&amp;D</b> game has come to a grinding halt as the DM and players struggled with the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_grappling')">grappling</a>
 rules. This article can't do much about the mayhem that ensues when big
 a monster grabs your character, but it can ease the confusion 
surrounding the grappling rules.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Grappling Basics</b></p>
<p align="left"> Everyone knows that grappling involves <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_grab')">grabbing</a> a foe and holding on, but it's a trifle more complicated than that. Here is an overview of the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li> A grapple <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a> begins with grabbing a foe.<br><br> You can't grapple anything until you get your hands on it first. For most <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a>, grabbing a foe for a grapple attack requires a successful <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleetouchattack')">melee touch attack</a>. <br><br> The grab provokes an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackofopportunity')">attack of opportunity</a> from the foe being grabbed. If the attack of opportunity hits and deals <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>, the grab automatically fails (see page 156 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). If the attack of opportunity doesn't hit, or if it hits and deals no damage (as it might if the target has <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damagereduction')">damage reduction</a>), it doesn't automatically defeat the grab, but the grab still fails if the melee touch attack fails.<br><br></li>
<li>An opposed grapple check follows a successful grab.<br><br> Once you
 grab someone, you must establish a hold, and you do that by making an 
opposed grapple check against your foe. The rules say the opposed 
grapple check that follows a successful grab is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_freeaction')">free action</a> for you, but it's really not an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a>
 at all. You make the grapple check as part of the attack you used to 
make the grab. Likewise, the opposed check your foe makes to resist you 
is not an action for him.<br><br> A grapple check is just like a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattackroll')">melee attack roll</a>, except that a special <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a> modifier replaces your normal size <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_modifier')">modifier</a>. In regular <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_melee')">melee</a> combat, smaller creatures get both an attack <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> and an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a> bonus. When grappling, the advantage goes to the bigger opponent. Table 7-1 in the<i> Monster Manual</i> shows size modifiers for regular and grappling combat. Page 156 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> also shows special size modifiers for grappling.<br><br>
 Because a grapple check is an opposed check, the combatant with the 
higher total wins the check. If the check is a tie, the combatant with 
the highest total grapple modifier (base attack bonus + Strength 
modifier + special size modifier + any miscellaneous that might apply). 
If there is a tie and both combatants have the same grapple modifier, 
roll again to break the tie.<br><br> If you win the opposed check, you deal unarmed strike damage to your foe (1d3 points of nonlethal damage for most <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a> characters) and you have your foe in your grasp.<br><br> If you lose the opposed check, your foe avoids your grasp.<br><br></li>
<li>You can maintain a hold on a foe from <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a> to round.<br><br>
 Once you establish a hold on a foe (by grabbing that foe and then 
winning the ensuing opposed grapple check) you can keep holding on by 
moving into the foe's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_space')">space</a>. This movement is free for you (it doesn't count against your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a> for the current round), but it provokes attacks of opportunity from foes that <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_threaten')">threaten</a> you (but not from the foe you have in your grasp).<br><br>
 You can enter your foe's space even if your relative sizes would 
normally keep you from ending your move in that foe's space or even 
passing through that space (see page 148 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).<br><br></li>
<li>Grappling has consequences.<br><br> You're grappling whenever you have a foe in your grasp or vice versa.<br><br> When you're grappling, you don't threaten any squares, not even the square you're in.<br><br> You lose your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a>
 bonus to AC (if you have one) against opponents you aren't grappling. 
(You can still use it against opponents you are grappling.)<br><br> You 
can't move while grappling unless you first win an opposed grapple 
check, and even then you have to drag your opponent along with you (see 
Part Two).<br><br> You share your foe's space when you're grappling. If 
you and your foe are different sizes, use the larger of the two space 
entries. Any attack that can reach the shared space can hit you. You 
don't get cover from a foe you're grappling, but any ranged attack aimed
 into your shared space has an equal chance to strike you or the 
creature you're grappling. Roll randomly to determine which creature a 
ranged attack strikes (see note 3 on Table 8-6 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).
 If you use a weapon against a foe you're grappling (see Part Two), you 
don't have to roll to determine the target you actually attack.<br><br></li>
<li>Grappling has size limits.<br><br> You can grab a creature of any 
size, but you cannot establish or maintain a hold on a creature that is 
two or more size categories bigger than you. For example, if you're a 
Medium creature, you can establish a hold only on a creature of Large 
size or smaller. Huge or bigger creatures are too big for you to 
grapple.<br><br></li>
<li>You make opposed checks many times when grappling.<br><br> When 
someone is trying to do something to you in a grapple, such as establish
 a hold, deal damage, or use your own weapon against you, you and your 
foe make opposed checks. An opposed grapple check you make to resist 
something your foe does is not an action for you, and you can make the 
opposed check even when you're flat footed or it isn't your turn.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Common Misconceptions about Grappling</b></p>
<p align="left"> You'll find that many of your problems with grappling will vanish if you avoid these common misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li> You're helpless when a foe has you in a hold, or when a foe has you pinned.<br><br>
 You lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) when grappling 
(even when it's you doing the holding), but you're not helpless. If 
you've been pinned (see Part Three), you have more troubles, but a 
pinned character isn't helpless, either.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> Because a grappling or pinned creature is not helpless, it is not subject to the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_coupdegrace')">coup de grace</a> special attack action.</p>
<ul>
<li> If you lose an opposed grapple check while holding on to a foe, your foe automatically escapes.<br><br>
 It is true that you must win an opposed grapple check to establish a 
hold right after you've grabbed a foe. Once you've established a hold, 
however, you keep holding on until you release your foe or your foe 
escapes. When you begin your turn with a foe in your grasp, you can make
 an opposed grapple check to accomplish many things, including damaging 
or pinning your foe (see Parts Two and Three). If you fail the opposed 
check, you don't accomplish whatever you were trying to do, but your 
failure doesn't release your foe.<br><br></li>
<li>If you win an opposed grapple check while a foe is holding on to you, you escape.<br><br>
 If you begin your turn in a foe's grasp, you can escape by making and 
winning an opposed grapple check. If you fail, you don't escape. During 
your foe's turn, you might have to make additional opposed grapple check
 to resist whatever your foe tries to do to you. Winning such a check 
merely foils whatever the foe was trying to do, but you don't escape 
unless you use an action on your own turn to escape.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Grappling Requirements</b></p>
<p align="left">The rules don't go into much detail about when you're 
capable of making grapple attacks. Common sense, however, suggests that 
because it involves grabbing and holding a foe, you need at least one 
hand free to do it.</p>
<p align="left">Creatures that lack manipulative appendages can make 
grapple attacks if they have body parts they can wrap around foes or 
some means of clamping down on a target. For example, a snake can 
grapple by biting and wrapping its body around a foe.</p>
