<p align="left">Incorporeality is, in many ways, the exact opposite of 
invisibility. You usually can see the creature just fine, but the 
creature has no physical substance. If you attack it, or try to touch 
it, nothing seems to be there.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Basics of Incorporeality </b></p>
<p align="left"> An incorporeal creature has the incorporeal subtype, which is described in detail in the <i>Monster Manual</i> glossary (and updated in the <i>Monster Manual III</i> glossary). As with many things in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, incorporeality is actually pretty straightforward. Figuring out 
how incorporeal things interact with the rest of the game world gets 
difficult, though. Take a look at this quick summary of what the <i>Monster Manual</i> has to say about incorporeal creatures.</p>
<ul>
<li> An incorporeal creature has no physical body.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">No matter what the creature looks like, it has no flesh,
 bones, protoplasm, or any other substance that makes up a corporeal 
creature's body. In effect, an incorporeal creature is a disembodied 
intellect or spirit.</p>
<p align="left">Because it lacks a physical body, it has no Strength 
score. Theoretically, an incorporeal creature may have a Constitution 
score, but such a creature would be strange indeed. In any case, 
incorporeal creatures don't need to eat, drink, or breathe. In fact, 
they cannot do these things because they have no Strength scores and 
they can't affect physical objects (or even air).</p>
<p align="left">Most incorporeal creatures cannot benefit from magical 
effects that require physical contact or manipulation of objects. They 
cannot benefit from <i>bull's strength</i> spells (they have no Strength
 scores to enhance), potions or oils (they cannot drink potions or apply
 oils), wear rings, don armor (except for ghost touch armor), or wield 
weapons (except for ghost touch weapons) or any other magic items that 
have to be worn or held to be used (which is most of them).</p>
<p align="left">Some items, such as ghost touch weaponry, work for 
incorporeal creatures. In such cases, an item that an incorporeal 
creature carries or hold also is incorporeal until the incorporeal 
creature, drops it, throws it, or puts it down (but see the section on 
ghost touch weapons).</p>
<p align="left">Incorporeal creatures are weightless. They cannot fall 
or take falling damage. The rules say incorporeal creatures cannot 
trigger traps that are activated by weight (such as covered pits). 
Though the rules don't say so specifically, an incorporeal creature 
won't trigger any trap that has a purely mechanical trigger.</p>
<p align="left">Incorporeal creatures move by flying, and they have perfect maneuverability.</p>
<ul>
<li> An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn't wish to be.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Presumably, an incorporeal creature can make some noise if it wants to -- perhaps a series of eerie moans, rattles, or taps.</p>
<p align="left">Because it has no body, an incorporeal creature also has
 no scent and doesn't create any tremors in the ground or any currents 
in the air. Special qualities such as tremorsense, blindsense, and 
blindsight usually don't allow their users to discern incorporeal 
creatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>An incorporeal creature can be harmed only by other incorporeal 
creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and 
spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to
 all nonmagical attack forms, including energy (acid, cold, electricity,
 fire, and sonic) unless they come from a spell, spell-like ability, or 
supernatural ability.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Without a physical body, most attacks simply have 
nothing to hit or to affect. A magical attack (including a magic weapon)
 made by a corporeal creature has a 50% chance to fail (with some 
exceptions). This reflects the possibility that the magic can somehow 
reach the creature and affect it. The failure chance works the same way 
as a miss chance does; for the sake the convenience, most people refer 
to the failure chance as the incorporeal miss chance.</p>
<p align="left">See Incorporeal Creatures in Combat for a more detailed discussion of what works against them and what does not.</p>
<ul>
<li> An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, 
but it must remain adjacent to the object's exterior. They cannot see 
through opaque objects, however.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature cannot pass entirely through an 
object that is thicker than its own space. For example, a spectre's size
 is Medium, so it can't pass through an object more than 5 feet thick. 
Without this rule, an incorporeal creature could use large solid objects
 to traverse great distances or even travel straight though the planet. 
The rules are silent on exactly how small an opening an incorporeal 
creature can pass through when an object is too thick to allow the 
creature to just move through it. I recommend that you allow an 
incorporeal creature to pass through any opening big enough to admit its
 head (if it has one). As a rule of thumb, this is about one eighth as 
wide as the creature is long or tall.</p>
<p align="left">Incorporeal creatures can, and often do, use solid 
objects or even corporeal creatures as cover in combat; see Incorporeal 
Creatures in Combat for details.</p>
<p align="left">In any case, incorporeal creatures ignore most things that hamper movement.</p>
<ul>
<li> Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> Because water isn't solid, it doesn't block or restrict incorporeal creatures at all. </p>
<ul>
<li> Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature doesn't lose its way when 
passing through a solid object, and its movement is not slowed when it 
cannot see. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Incorporeal Creatures in Combat </b></p>
<p align="left">Handling a combat with a creature that is present on the battlefield but has no body isn't always easy, but it can be done.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Incorporeal Creatures Attacking </b></p>
<p align="left">Most incorporeal creatures can deliver a physical attack
 by striking at other creatures. Although this attack is called an 
incorporeal touch attack, it more closely resembles a slam attack. It's 
called an incorporeal touch attack because it ignores armor, natural 
armor, and shield bonuses, just as a touch attack does. Unlike a touch 
attack, however, force effects block an incorporeal touch attack. 
Deflection bonuses work against incorporeal touch attacks (just as they 
work against true touch attacks). In most cases, you can resolve the 
attack using the defender's touch Armor Class -- just be sure to include
 any force effects the defender is using, such as a <i>mage armor</i> spell (or a magic item that duplicates that spell's effects, such as <i>bracers of armor</i>) or a <i>shield</i> spell. Ghost touch armor also proves effective against an incorporeal touch attack.</p>
<p align="left">Because an incorporeal creature has no Strength score, it uses its Dexterity modifier for melee attacks.</p>
<p align="left">Because an incorporeal creature cannot exert any 
Strength and its body (such as it is) passes through material objects, 
an incorporeal creature cannot use bull rush, disarm, grapple, overrun, 
sunder, or trip attacks against corporeal creatures or objects. Some of 
these attack forms are possible against other incorporeal creatures (see
 Incorporeal Against Incorporeal in Part Four).</p>
<p align="left">If an incorporeal creature can cast spells or use other 
kinds of magic, its spells and magical effects work equally well on both
 corporeal and incorporeal recipients (no miss chance), except that an 
incorporeal creature cannot touch a corporeal creature and cannot use 
spells or other effects with a touch range. Nevertheless, some 
incorporeal creatures have special attacks that can be delivered through
 its incorporeal touch attack, such as a spectre's energy drain attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghost Touch Weaponry </b></p>
<p align="left">An incorporeal creature can pick up and wield a ghost 
touch weapon even though the creature lacks a Strength score. When the 
creature makes an attack, it uses its Dexterity modifier to modify the 
attack roll (even for a melee attack) and no Strength modifier applies 
to the damage roll. (Because the incorporeal attacker does not have a 
Strength score, its Strength modifier is +0.)</p>
<p align="left">According to the<i> Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, a ghost 
touch weapon functions as either a corporeal or incorporeal object, 
whichever is better for the wielder at the time. This is convenient for 
an incorporeal creature that wants to carry a ghost touch weapon through
 a wall. What this means when an incorporeal wielder uses a ghost touch 
weapon to attack a corporeal foe is not quite clear, though. Presumably,
 an incorporeal wielder can choose which way the weapon acts at the time
 of the attack; this does not require an action on the wielder's part, 
and the wielder can make the choice even when it is not the wielder's 
turn. (For example, when the wielder uses the ghost touch weapon for an 
attack of opportunity.)</p>
<p align="left">When an incorporeal attacker wields a ghost touch weapon
 as a corporeal weapon, the attack is resolved against the defender's 
normal Armor Class. An incorporeal attacker wielding a ghost touch 
weapon in this manner can use the weapon to make a disarm or sunder 
attack. If the weapon can be used for a trip attack (see the weapon's 
description in Chapter 7 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>), an incorporeal attacker can make a trip attack with it.</p>
<p align="left">When an incorporeal attacker wields a ghost touchweapon 
as an incorporeal weapon, the attack is resolved as an incorporeal touch
 attack. If the attack hits, the weapon deals the normal damage for a 
weapon of its kind, plus any bonus damage from its enhancement bonus, 
but no Strength modifier applies. If an incorporeal creature fires ghost
 touch ammunition or throws a ghost touch weapon, the projectile or 
weapon becomes corporeal the moment it leaves the incorporeal creature's
 possession, though it retains the ghost touch property.</p>
<p align="left">The foregoing suggests that a corporeal attacker could 
choose to wield a ghost touch weapon as either a corporeal or an 
incorporeal weapon as well, but I don't recommend that you do so. The 
ghost touch property isn't priced to reflect such a potent ability. If 
you don't like the disparity in abilities between corporeal and 
incorporeal wielders, I recommend that you always have attackers use 
ghost touch<i></i>weaponry as a corporeal attack (except that the weapon still ignores incorporeal miss chances).</p>
