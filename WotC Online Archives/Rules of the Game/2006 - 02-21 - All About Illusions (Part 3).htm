<p align="left">Last week, we considered how casters aim <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_illusionsubschool')">illusion</a>
 spells and began a discussion about disbelieving illusions. This week 
we'll consider a few more aspects of disbelief -- including the crucial 
step of interacting with an illusion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Interacting With Illusions</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-21%20-%20All%20About%20Illusions%20%28Part%203%29_files/dx0207rg_rulesgame_illusion.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="255" width="266">According to page 173 in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> you don't receive a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throw</a>
 against an illusion effect with a disbelief saving throw until you 
study the illusion carefully or interact with it in some way. The text 
uses an illusory floor as an example. The character in the example 
provided there gets a saving throw by stopping to examine the floor 
(study) or by probing the floor (interaction).</p>
<p align="left">For game purposes, we can define "studying" an illusion as taking an action (which <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DMs</a> can choose to make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moveaction')">move action</a>
 since this is an extrapolation of the rules and not an actual rule) to 
observe an illusion effect and note its details. Some DMs I know require
 a Spot or Search <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_check')">check</a> to disbelieve an illusion. That's going too far. Merely pausing and using an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a> to make the check is enough to allow a saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">Also for game purposes, we can define "interacting" with
 an illusion as doing something that could affect the illusion or 
allowing the illusion to have an affect on you. You have a valid claim 
to an interaction with an illusion when you <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a>
 it, touch it, talk to it, poke it with a stick, target it with a spell,
 or do something else that one might do with a real creature or object.</p>
<p align="left">The key to disbelieving an illusion is investing some 
time and effort in the illusion. If you decide to ignore the illusion, 
you don't get a saving throw to disbelieve it. Let's consider the 
illusory guard from a previous example. The guard is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_figmentsubschool')">figment</a> created with a <i>major image</i><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>,
 and the caster has left the illusory guard to prowl around a chamber. A
 character entering or looking into the chamber might react to the 
illusory guard in several ways, some of which will allow a saving throw 
to disbelieve and some that will not. Here are just a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li> The character tries to sneak past the guard.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Although both hiding and moving silently are resolved 
with opposed skill checks, the character really isn't doing anything 
that could affect the illusion and isn't really interacting with it. It 
would be best to call for the appropriate checks from the sneaking 
character and then pretend to make the opposed rolls (the illusory guard
 cannot see or hear the character). The character doesn't get a saving 
throw against the illusion.</p>
<ul>
<li> The character attacks the guard.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Attacking an illusion is a definite interaction. The character makes the attack, using at least a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_standardaction')">standard action</a> to do so. Hit or miss, the character makes a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Willsave')">Will save</a> to disbelieve the illusion immediately after making the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack roll</a>.</p>
<p align="left">If the attack hits, the character probably should 
disbelieve automatically (see Automatic Interactions or Automatic 
Disbelief, below) as the character sees and feels the weapon passing 
through the figment with no effect (just like swinging the weapon 
through empty air). If the illusion in question were a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_shadowsubschool')">shadow</a> instead of a figment, a successful attack would not result in automatic disbelief (there's something solid to hit there).</p>
<ul>
<li> The character takes a moment to observe the guard's movements.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The DM can choose to make this at least a move action 
for the character -- as noted earlier, this is an extrapolation of the 
rules, not an actual rule. No check is required, and the character makes
 a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion as part of the action used to
 observe the guard. </p>
<ul>
<li> The character tries to identify the guard's uniform or insignia (or simply looks for the same).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This kind of scrutiny merits a standard action. The 
character makes a Spot or Search check to look over the guard's gear (or
 possibly an appropriate Knowledge check). A successful check reveals 
something about the guard's gear. For example, if the illusion's caster 
included insignia or if a particular uniform style is included in the 
figment, the check reveals those. In any case, the character makes a 
saving throw to disbelieve the illusion as part of the action used to 
study the guard, even if the check fails to uncover any details.</p>
<ul>
<li> The character taunts the guard or asks the guard a question.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This one might qualify as an interaction, or it might not. Speaking usually is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_freeaction')">free action</a>, but meaningful communication between two creatures takes up some time.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 144 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Speak</b></p>
<p align="left">In general, speaking is a free action that you can 
perform even when it isn't your turn. Some DMs may rule that a character
 can only speak on his turn, or that a character can't speak while 
flatfooted (and thus can't warn allies of a surprise threat until he has
 a chance to act). Speaking more than few sentences is generally beyond 
the limit of a free action; to communicate more information than that, 
your DM may require that you take a move action or even a full-round 
action.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the character and the guard are alone and there hasn't been an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a>
 roll, the character needs to stick around to note the guard's reaction 
to the taunt or wait for the guard's reply to truly interact with the 
illusion. (That's the equivalent of a move or standard action.) The 
character makes a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion as part of the
 action used to communicate with the guard.</p>
<p align="left">If this interaction occurs during an encounter, the 
character could speak as a free action, but she probably would have to 
wait until the following round to attempt a saving throw to disbelieve. 
(A real creature would need the same interval to respond, probably using
 a free action itself.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Automatic Disbelief</b></p>
<p align="left">According to the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> if you're 
faced with proof that an illusion isn't real, you disbelieve the 
illusion without making a saving throw. The rules give a few examples of
 "proof" that an illusion isn't real. If you step on an illusory floor 
and fall through, you know that floor isn't real. Likewise, if you poke 
around an illusory floor and your hand (or the implement you're using as
 a probe) goes through the floor, you know the floor isn't real.</p>
<p align="left">It's worth noting that in both examples the illusion 
fails to function as a real object would. A real floor is solid. It 
supports your weight (unless it breaks under you), and you can't push 
objects or parts of your body through it. A character could create an 
illusion that reacts appropriately when disturbed (with a <i>programmed image</i>
 spell, for example). In such cases, a character interacting with the 
illusion still must make a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. For 
example, if you use a <i>programmed image</i> spell to create an 
illusory floor that collapses when someone touches it or walks in it, 
that's consistent with the way at least some real floors work and a 
saving throw is required to disbelieve even when someone falls through 
it.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't say so, but if you create an illusion 
that allows a saving throw for disbelief, you automatically disbelieve 
it (you know it isn't real because you created it).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Automatic Interactions</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part Two, you must take some action that 
could affect an illusion before you can attempt to make a saving throw 
to disbelieve it. Some illusion spells, however, allow saves to 
disbelieve even when you don't use an action to interact with them. The <i>ventriloquism</i>
 spell, for example, allows a saving throw to disbelieve whenever you 
hear the figment sound the spell produces. It always pays to read an 
illusion spell's description for such exceptions to the general rule.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dealing with the Unbelievable: </b>The rules 
governing illusions assume that the spellcaster is at least trying to 
create something believable. When an illusion spell allows a saving 
throw for disbelief and the caster creates something unbelievably weird,
 it's best to allow an immediate saving throw. You're the best judge of 
what's unbelievable in your campaign. In a world where dogs breathe fire
 (hell hounds), immense dragons fly through the air, and wizards can 
shoot bolts of lightning from their fingertips, what's unbelievable 
covers a tiny slice indeed. Still, if the illusion caster is just being 
silly (singing carnivorous vegetables, bloodsucking bunnies, dancing 
hippos), it's best to just roll a saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pointing Out Illusions</b></p>
<p align="left">According to page 174 in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> a
 character who successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates 
that information to others grants those other characters a +4 bonus on 
saving throws to disbelieve the illusion. The rules don't specifically 
say so, but a character claiming the bonus still must use an action to 
study or interact with the illusion before attempting a saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next </b></p>
<p align="left">We're out of time once again. Next week, we'll consider a few miscellaneous topics related to illusion spells.</p>
