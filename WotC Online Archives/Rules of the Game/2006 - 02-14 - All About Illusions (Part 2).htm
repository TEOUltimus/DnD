<p align="left">Last week, we examined <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_illusionsubschool')">illusion subschools</a> and considered what an illusion <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell's</a>
 subschool says about what the spell can do. This week, we'll continue 
our look at illusion basics by considering two other key elements in an 
illusion spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aiming Illusion Spells</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, a spell's area, target, or effect entry determines how and where the caster can aim the spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Area: </b>Any spell that has an area entry fills some
 volume of space when it takes effect. Most spell areas are immobile 
after they're cast, but be on the lookout for area spells that are 
portable. The <i>silence</i> spell, for example, is an illusion spell with an area (an emanation) that can be centered on a mobile object or on a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creature</a> so that the spell's effects move along with it.</p>
<p align="left">Illusion spells that have area entries often affect 
subjects that are in the area at the time the spell is cast or that 
enter the area while the spell lasts. This is particularly true of 
illusion spells from the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_patternsubschool')">pattern subschool</a>, such as <i>rainbow pattern.</i> Subjects that merely see the pattern from outside the area it fills aren't affected.</p>
<p align="left">Other illusion spells create a false sensation throughout the area or alter an area's sensory properties. Spells from the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_glamersubschool')">glamer subschool</a> often have areas that work this way. Examples include <i>hallucinatory terrain</i> and <i>mirage arcana</i>. Anyone with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofsight')">line of sight</a>
 to such a spell's area can notice whatever sensation the spell 
produces, even from outside the spell's area (provided that the creature
 has the appropriate senses). For example, if you use a <i>hallucinatory terrain</i>
 spell to make an empty patch of sand look like an oasis, anyone who can
 see that patch of sand sees the illusion you have created. Audible 
illusions might remain audible even without line of sight. For example, 
if you create the image of a creaky windmill, creatures nearby can hear 
the mill creaking even when it's too dark to see the mill.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2002-14%20-%20All%20About%20Illusions%20%28Part%202%29_files/dx0207rg_rulesgame_shadow.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="242" width="248"><b>Effect:</b>
 A spell with an effect entry produces something. An illusion spell with
 an effect entry produces a sound, smell, texture, taste, visual image, 
or some combination of the five. Spells from the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_figmentsubschool')">figment subschool</a>
 often have effect entries that look a great deal like areas. The effect
 entry specifies a maximum volume for the image (or images) the spell 
produces.</p>
<p align="left">You can make images you create move around, but only with the volume limit set for the spell. For example, you could use a <i>major image</i>
 spell to create an illusory guard that paces around a room, but you 
can't make your illusory guard accompany you wherever you go (unless you
 stay inside the spell's volume limit).</p>
<p align="left">As with an area illusion, anyone nearby can perceive an 
effect illusion. For instance, the marching guard from the previous 
example can be seen and heard just as a real guard could be.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Target:</b> When a spell has a target entry, you 
select one or more recipients to receive the spell (there might be 
limits to the targets you can select, see Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040824a">Reading Spell Descriptions, Part Five</a>). In any case, all your targets must be in range and you must have <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofeffect')">line of effect</a> to them. If you don't have line of sight to a recipient, you still can select it as a target if you can touch it.</p>
<p align="left">Once a target receives a spell, the spell's effect moves along with it.</p>
<p align="left">Because glamer spells change the recipient's sensory 
properties, most glamers have target entries (often the caster or 
something the caster touches). <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_phantasmsubschool')">Phantasms</a>, which affect the recipient's mind, also usually have target entries.</p>
<p align="left">As with illusion spells that have area or effect 
entries, anyone with line of sight to the recipient of a targeted 
illusion spell perceives the illusion the spell creates (except for 
phantasms, as noted earlier). For example, the <i>invisibility</i> spell
 makes a subject vanish from sight. Anyone looking at the space 
containing the invisible subject sees nothing (or at least does not see 
the subject).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Saving Throws and Illusion Spells</b></p>
<p align="left">Most spells' saving throw entries are self-explanatory; 
however, some illusion spells have a kind of saving throw that causes a 
few problems.</p>
<p align="left">Most figment spells (and a few other illusions) have <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throw</a> entries that read: "<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Willsave')">Will</a>
 disbelief (if interacted with)." This can prove maddeningly vague, 
especially when someone decides to start splitting hairs. Anyone who has
 played the game for more than a few hours knows what a Will save is. 
But what is the effect of disbelief and what constitutes interaction?</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b></b><b>From pages 173-174 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief ):</b> 
Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws 
to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact 
with it in some fashion. For example, if a party encounters a section of
 illusory floor, the character in the lead would receive a saving throw 
if she stopped and studied the floor or if she probed the floor.</p>
<p align="left">A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it
 to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent 
outline. For example, a character making a successful saving throw 
against a figment of an illusory section of floor knows the "floor" 
isn't safe to walk on and can see what lies below (light permitting), 
but he or she can still note where the figment lies.</p>
<p align="left">A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails 
to notice something is amiss. A character faced with proof that an 
illusion isn't real needs no saving throw. A character who falls through
 a section of illusory floor into a pit knows something is amiss, as 
does one who spends a few rounds poking at the same illusion. If any 
viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact 
to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Disbelief</b></p>
<p align="left">Page 173 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> covers 
disbelief in detail. The text there can be summed up fairly easily. If 
you make a successful saving throw against an illusion effect and 
disbelieve it, you stop perceiving the illusion and it has no effect on 
you at all. Illusions from the figment or glamer subschools, however, 
remain behind as faint, translucent outlines even after you successfully
 disbelieve them. These see-through remnants have no effects on you at 
all, but serve to remind you that the illusion is there. It also reminds
 you of those things with which other less perceptive individuals might 
have to deal. The rules use an illusory section of floor (presumably a 
figment) as an example. If you have disbelieved the illusion, you see 
the floor (light permitting) as it is; that is, with a gaping hole in 
it. You also see the outlines of the illusion, however, which can prove 
handy when an unsuspecting ally comes on the scene. In fact, you can 
convey your knowledge to your ally and grant your pal a saving throw 
bonus (see Pointing Out Illusions in Part Three).</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't say what happens if you successfully 
disbelieve a figment or glamer that doesn't have a visual element. It's a
 safe bet, however, that you remain aware of the figment or glamer 
without being affected or hindered in any way.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">We're out of time for this week. Next week, we'll 
complete our study of saving throws against illusion spells beginning 
with a discussion of what it means to "interact" with an illusion.</p>
