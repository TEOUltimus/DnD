<p align="left"><i>Rules of the Game</i> explored <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_polymorph')">polymorphing</a> in detail back in the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040511a">spring of 2004</a>. The recent announcement regarding the <i>polymorph</i><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>
 and the spate of errata documents it has spawned, however, has changed 
the polymorph landscape somewhat, and that merits a new look at 
polymorphing here.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> The <i>polymorph</i> spell itself hasn't changed at all; see <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20060216a">the announcement</a> for details. What has changed is the <i>polymorph</i>
 spell's role as the basis for most forms of shapeshifting in the game. 
Most effects and class features that once referenced the <i>polymorph</i> spell now refer to the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_alternateform')">alternate form</a><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_specialquality')"> special quality</a> instead. Unfortunately, the alternate form description refers the reader back to the <i>polymorph</i> spell, and that text contains references to the <i>alter self </i>spell. All of this cross-referencing sows confusion when characters begin switching forms during adventures.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> This series examines alternate form and how it works in the game. The material presented here draws heavily on the original <i>Rules of the Game</i> series <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040511a">on polymorphing</a>. Refer to the original series for a glossary of terms used in this series.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Basics of Alternate Form</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You'll find rules for the alternate form special quality on page 305 in the <i>Monster Manual. </i>Here's an overview, along with some reminders and commentary:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_supernaturalability')">Supernatural ability</a>.<br><br> Alternate form is magical and will not function within an <i>antimagic field</i> or anywhere else where magic is negated or suppressed.<br><br> Taking an alternate form is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_standardaction')">standard action</a> that does not provoke an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackofopportunity')">attack of opportunity</a>.<br><br> A creature using the alternate form power has a moderate aura of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_transmutation')">transmutation</a> magic (because there's magic in the transformation into the assumed form), but alternate form is not subject to <i>dispel magic</i> because supernatural abilities can't be dispelled -- see page 289 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> -- nor are they subject to counterspells.<br><br>
 Alternate form works only on the creature using the power. It cannot be
 used on another creature, even through the share spells ability.<br><br></li>
<li>Limited forms.<br><br> A creature with the alternate form special 
quality can assume one or more specific alternate forms, which are 
specified in the creature's description. The creature cannot use 
alternate forms that are not specified in the description.<br><br></li>
<li> No healing.<br><br> Unlike the <i>polymorph</i> spell, a creature using alternate form doesn't regain any <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a> when assuming a new form.<br><br></li>
<li>Gains and losses.<br><br> Upon assuming a new form, the creature 
loses some of its own characteristics and gains certain characteristics 
of the assumed form instead. The creature also retains some of its own 
characteristics. The section that follows examines what changes and what
 stays the same. This examination concludes in Part Two.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Assuming an Alternate Form</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">An alternate form is mostly physical. A creature in an 
alternate form retains its essential self, but changes its outward 
appearance and physical attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon changing form, the creature gains the assumed form's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a>.<br><br>
 The size gained is always the size for a typical example of the assumed
 form's kind. A creature's typical size is listed at the top of its 
statistics block in the creature's description. Most creatures allow for
 some size variations, but those are for exceptional specimens. For 
example, a typical dire bear is size <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Large')">Large</a>. Some dire bears are <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Huge')">Huge</a>
 (see the advancement section in the dire bear creature description), 
but if a creature assumes dire bear form through the alternate form 
class feature, it becomes Large.<br><br> It is possible for a creature 
description to specify a different size than the typical size for an 
assumed form, but an assumed form is limited to the typical size if a 
different size isn't specified.<br><br> A few creatures have a range of 
typical sizes. Examples include sharks, monstrous spiders, and 
tojanidas. In such cases the creature description specifies which sizes 
the assumed form can have. If not, alternate form allows the creature to
 assume any typical size. For example, a bronze dragon could assume the 
form of a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Tiny')">Tiny</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Small')">Small</a>, or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a> viper because those are all typical sizes for vipers (see page 280 in the <i>Monster Manual</i>)
 and all fall within the range of sizes the dragon's alternate form 
power allows. Beware of additional blocks of statistics in a creature 
description that show the creature with a few <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_level')">levels</a>
 added (such as the mummy lord), or creature descriptions that show 
alternative forms (such as lycanthropes). You can't use alternate form 
to assume a form with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_classlevel')">class levels</a> or to assume another creature's alternative forms when shape shifting.<br><br></li>
<li>A creature retains its own type and subtypes when assuming a new form.<br><br>
 The creature's body might look and feel a little different, but it's 
still the same creature. Any vulnerabilities or immunities the creature 
has by virtue of its original type and subtype remain in the assumed 
form. For example a gold dragon retains its immunity to magic <i>sleep</i> and paralyzation effects (from its dragon type) even when it assumes an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_animaltype')">animal</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_humanoidtype')">humanoid</a> form. It also retains its immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold (from its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_firesubtype')">fire subtype</a>) when in an assumed form.<br><br>
 A creature does not gain the assumed form's type or subtypes, and it 
does not gain any vulnerabilities or immunities from the assumed form's 
type and subtypes (with one exception noted in the sidebar and addressed
 later).<br><br> Special attacks or effects that depend on the 
recipient's type or subtypes affect a creature in an assumed form the 
same way they would affect the creature when it is in its natural form. 
For example, a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ranger')">ranger</a>
 whose favored enemy is dragons meets a gold dragon that has assumed the
 form of a cat (a creature of the animal type). The ranger still 
benefits from the skill and combat <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonuses</a>
 her favored enemy class feature provides when she interacts with the 
masquerading dragon. Likewise, a ranger whose favored enemy is animals 
would not gain any benefits against the dragon, even when the dragon 
wears a cat's form.<br><br></li>
<li>A creature in an alternate form gains the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalweapon')">natural weapons</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalarmorbonus')">natural armor</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_movementmodes')">movement modes</a>, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_extraordinaryability')">extraordinary</a> special attacks of its new form.<br><br>
 The creature loses natural weapons, natural armor, movement modes, and 
any extraordinary special attacks of its original form not derived from 
class levels from its natural form in favor of what the new form 
provides (but see Part Three). All the things listed here are derived 
wholly (or mostly) from the creature's outward physical form -- claws, 
teeth, limbs, skin, and the like. These things change when the 
creature's body changes. For example, an adult bronze dragon has six 
natural weapons (bite, two claws, two wings, and a tail), all of which 
it can use with the full attack action. If the dragon assumes a 
crocodile's form, it has only two natural weapons (bite and tail) and 
can use one at a time, even in a full attack (see the crocodile creature
 description). The example dragon also gives up its crush extraordinary 
attack and gains the crocodile's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_improvedgrab')">improved grab</a>
 instead. The dragon's +20 natural armor bonus becomes +4 (the 
crocodile's natural armor bonus). The dragon loses its flying speed 
(along with its wings) and its land and swim speeds as well. Instead it 
uses the crocodile's land speed of 20 feet and the crocodile's swim 
speed of 30 feet. See Part Two for more notes on speeds.</li>
