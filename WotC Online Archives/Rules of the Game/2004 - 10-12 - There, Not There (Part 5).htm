<p align="left">As noted back in Part One, any creature becomes ethereal when it is on the Ethereal Plane. Chapter 5 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 includes a detailed a description of the Ethereal Plane; however most 
difficulties in play arise when creatures on the Material Plane (where 
most <b>D&amp;D</b> adventures take place) try to interact with creatures on the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Etherealness Basics and Misconceptions </b></p>
<p align="left">The fundamental thing to remember about etherealness is 
that an ethereal creature or object is not present on the Material 
Plane. The Ethereal and the Material Plane are coexistent (see page 150 
in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>), which makes interactions between creatures on the two planes fairly common.</p>
<p align="left">With respect to creatures and objects on the Material 
Plane, an ethereal creature has many of the properties of invisibility 
and incorporeality. In fact, the rules often speak of ethereal creatures
 as invisible and incorporeal. Unfortunately, an ethereal creature is 
not really invisible (just unseen) and it is not incorporeal at all 
(though it can do many of the same things that an incorporeal creature 
can do). This last point is worth repeating: The rules tend to use the 
terms etherealness and incorporeality interchangeably because it is 
convenient to do so, but the two are not equivalent. Here's a summary of
 the abilities and properties an ethereal creature has with respect to 
objects and creatures on the Material Plane:</p>
<ul>
<li> Effective invisibility and silence.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Although a creature on the Ethereal can see indistinctly into the Material Plane (see pages 151 and 293 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>), creatures on the Material Plane can't see into the Ethereal without some kind of magical aid. A <i>detect invisibility</i> or <i>true seeing</i> spell used on the Material Plane reveals things on the Ethereal.</p>
<p align="left">Because an ethereal creature or object is not actually 
present on the Material Plane, a creature on the Material Plane cannot 
make a Spot or Listen check to notice or locate it (because there's 
nothing at hand to see or hear). Likewise, nonvisual senses such as 
blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense can't discern or locate 
ethereal things.</p>
<ul>
<li> Immaterial and weightless.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Because the Ethereal and the Material Plane are 
coexistent, each point on the Material Plane corresponds with a point on
 the Ethereal and vice versa. To an observer on the Material Plane, a 
creature moving on the Ethereal seems to float along the Material Plane 
landscape. It also seems to move right through material objects and 
creatures. That's because most things on the Material Plane don't exist 
on the Ethereal.</p>
<p align="left">Unlike an incorporeal creature, an ethereal creature 
doesn't have to stay adjacent to the object's exterior when it enters 
the object, so it can pass through an object of any thickness. An 
ethereal creature cannot see through opaque objects on the Material 
Plane; when within a material object, an ethereal creature cannot see 
anything on the Material Plane, though it usually can see other ethereal
 things.</p>
<p align="left">An ethereal creature can hear sounds from the Material 
Plane. Unlike an incorporeal creature, it does not get a Listen bonus 
when it is inside a solid object.</p>
<p align="left">Force effects extend into the Ethereal Plane, so a force barrier, such as a <i>wall of force</i>, blocks an ethereal creature.</p>
<p align="left">The Ethereal Plane has no gravity. A creature on the 
Ethereal can move in any direction using its fastest speed rating. 
Hazards and obstacles on the Material Plane don't interfere with an 
ethereal creature's movement or damage the ethereal creature (but see 
Combat with Ethereal creatures).</p>
<ul>
<li> Unable to affect creatures or objects on the Material Plane.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">An ethereal creature cannot touch, damage, move, or otherwise physically interact with things on the Material Plane.</p>
<p align="left">It goes without saying, but ghost touch weapons an 
ethereal creature wields don't affect targets on the Material Plane. 
Spells and other magical effects that an ethereal creature uses don't 
have any affects on the Material Plane, and neither do extraordinary 
abilities.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat With Ethereal Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">Although ethereal creatures can't do anything to affect 
creatures on the Material Plane, the opposite isn't true. Any magical 
effect with the force descriptor extends to the Ethereal when it is 
created on the Material Plane (the opposite is not true). A caster can 
target a spell such as <i>magic missile,</i> for example, at an ethereal creature.</p>
<p align="left">Because ethereal creatures can see into the Material 
Plane, gaze attacks used on the Material Plane also affect ethereal 
creatures. The rules don't mention it, but you reasonably can assume 
that a creature looking into the Ethereal Plane with a divination spell 
(such as <i>true seeing</i> or <i>see invisibility</i>) would be susceptible to a gaze attack from an ethereal creature.</p>
<p align="left">Two ethereal creatures can fight and affect each other 
in the same way that two creatures on the Material Plane can, except 
that combat on the Ethereal Plane takes place in three dimensions.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Ghosts</b></p>
<p align="left">Thanks to its manifestation power, ghosts get most 
peoples' votes for the most troublesome denizens of the Ethereal Plane. 
The most important thing to remember about a ghost is that it is 
ethereal, not incorporeal, until it uses its manifestation power to move
 onto the Material Plane. Once a ghost does so, it becomes an 
incorporeal creature on the Material Plane, though it also remains on 
the Ethereal Plane as well. Although the ghost template lists the ghost 
as an incorporeal creature, it is not incorporeal until it manifests and
 even then it is only incorporeal with respect to the things on the 
Material Plane. To anyone or anything on the Ethereal, even a manifested
 ghost is corporeal.</p>
<p align="left">As a supernatural ability, manifestation requires a 
standard action to use. Once manifested, a ghost also can use a standard
 action to fully return to the Ethereal Plane.</p>
<p align="left">With respect to the Material Plane, a manifested ghost 
functions just like an incorporeal creature as described in Parts Three 
and Four, except for two things: A manifested ghost can move through a 
creature or object of any size (thanks to its etherealness). A 
manifested ghost that has a magic weapon with it on the Ethereal Plane 
can use the weapon to strike creatures. A manifested ghost using a magic
 weapon that is not a ghost touch<i></i>weapon is making an incorporeal 
touch attack. The ghost's Strength modifier doesn't apply to the attack 
roll (even for a melee attack) or to the damage roll. The ghost's 
Dexterity modifier applies to the attack roll. The attack ignores armor 
(except ghost touch armor). The attack has a 50% miss chance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghosts and Ghost Touch Items</b></p>
<p align="left">A manifested ghost using ghost touch equipment can do so
 either as a corporeal or an incorporeal user, depending on exactly 
where the ghost touch equipment is. If a manifested ghost finds a ghost 
touch weapon or ghost touch armor just lying on the Material Plane, it 
can handle and use that ghost touch equipment in exactly the same way 
that an incorporeal creature can. If a ghost on the Ethereal Plane has 
ghost touch equipment with it on that plane, however, then it uses ghost
 touch weaponry as a corporeal creature on the Material Plane does when 
attacking a foe on the Material Plane. (That is, the ghost has no miss 
chance, it makes a regular attack that must deal with the target's 
armor, and the ghost's Strength score applies to the attack and damage 
rolls.)</p>
<p align="left">Against most attacks, ghost touch armor worn on the 
Ethereal Plane protects a manifested ghost the same way it protects an 
incorporeal creature. The ghost retains its incorporeal miss chance and 
gains only the armor's enhancement bonus to its Armor Class.</p>
<p align="left">Against a ghost touch weapon wielded on the Material 
Plane, a manifested ghost still uses its manifested Armor Class, though 
there is no incorporeal miss chance. (The manifested ghost's equipment 
remains insubstantial against foes on the Material Plane.) If a 
manifested ghost wears ghost touch armor, the full value of that armor 
applies against a ghost touch weapon, and the ghost still gets its 
deflection bonus for being incorporeal. If the same attacker moved to 
the Ethereal Plane, the ghost would lose its deflection bonus to Armor 
Class.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Manifestation Miscellany </b></p>
<p align="left">The manifestation power can prove troublesome in a few 
circumstances. Take a look at some suggestions on how to deal with the 
worst cases.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Manifesting Inside Objects or Creatures:</b> An 
ethereal ghost can move to an object's or creature's location on the 
Material Plane and then manifest so that it appears inside the creature 
or object. Treat this just like any other attempt to move through a 
creature or object, except, as noted earlier, the ghost doesn't have to 
stay adjacent to the creature's or object's exterior. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Malevolence:</b> If the ghost has the malevolence 
power, there is no attack of opportunity when it enters a subject's 
space, and no touch attack is required if the subject has a deflection 
bonus to Armor Class. If the subject makes a successful saving throw 
against the malevolence attack, however, the ghost cannot enter the 
subject's space and must go back to whatever space it left to use the 
malevolence power. The attempt to enter the subject's space counts 
against the ghost's movement for the turn, but going back does not.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Returning to the Ethereal Plane:</b> Because a 
manifested ghost can't exert any Strength on the Material Plane, it 
cannot grab things while manifested and drag them back to the Ethereal. 
It could, however, seize a ghost touch item and bring that back to the 
Ethereal Plane (where it could then handle the item normally). It's best
 to assume that a ghost can't use this trick with a ghost touch item in 
another creature's possession.</p>
<p align="left">A <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell used against a 
manifested ghost has little effect because the ghost already is on both 
the Material Plane and Ethereal Planes. While the spell lasts, however, 
the manifested ghost cannot exit the Material Plane.</p>
