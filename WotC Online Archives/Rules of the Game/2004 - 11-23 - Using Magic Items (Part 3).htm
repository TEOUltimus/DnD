<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="590">
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">A few other questions remain to be answered even after you've established that a character can activate an item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Items with Limited Uses </b></p>
<p align="left">Many items don't work all the time but instead work only
 a certain number of times or a certain number of times each day, week, 
or other time period.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Charged Items:</b> Items such as wands and staffs 
hold only a specific number of charges. Once those charges are used up, 
the item becomes inert and nonmagical. Most charged items are activated 
with a spell trigger or a command (see Part Two), and they usually can 
function only once a round because it takes a standard action to 
activate them. Some charged items work automatically, expending their 
power whenever needed (a <i>brooch of shielding</i> for example) and they work as often as needed so long as their charges haven't run out.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Uses Per Day:</b> Other items work only a certain 
number of times each day; for example, most rods fall into this 
category. The rules don't bother defining a "day" for you, and most of 
us can figure that out on our own. If it ever becomes important, treat a
 "day" as any contiguous period of 24 hours. There is no set "recharge" 
time for a magic item. Instead, the item functions a set number of times
 in any given period of 24 hours. For example, a <i>rod of enemy detection</i>
 works three times a day. You cannot activate the rod three times 
starting at 11 PM one day, then activate it three more times starting 2 
hours later (at 1 AM the next day). Instead, you can activate the rod up
 to three times during any period of 24 consecutive hours. If you 
activate the rod at 11 PM on a given day, you can activate it only twice
 more during the following 24 hours. Let's say you activate the rod 
again at 1 AM the next day and again at 7 AM that same day. You have 
exhausted your daily limit of activating the rod ability at 7 AM. The 
earliest you can activate the rod again is 11 PM on the second day, when
 you can activate the rod only once (because you already have activated 
the rod twice during the preceding 24 hours). If you don't use the rod 
at all after 7 AM the second day, the earliest that you will have three 
activations available again will be 7 AM on the third day.</p>
<p align="left">Once you exhaust an item's daily use limit, the item remains magical, it just won't function for awhile.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Use Limits for Other Time Periods: </b>The foregoing 
applies to other items that have use cycles longer than a day. For 
example, if an item works only a few times a week, the use limit applies
 to any contiguous period of seven days (even if your game world doesn't
 use 7-day weeks).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elapsed Time Limits:</b> A few items work only for a certain total amount of time each day. For example, <i>boots of speed</i>
 work a maximum of 10 rounds each day. In most cases, the time you use 
such an item need not be continuous. For example, you can activate or 
deactivate <i>boots of speed</i> as many times as you like in a day, so 
long as the boots aren't activated for more than 10 rounds during one 
day (see the notes under Uses Per Day for a definition of a day). Such 
items are almost always command activated and it takes a standard action
 to activate or deactivate them (unless you simply allow the time limit 
on the item to run out).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wearing Magic Items </b></p>
<p align="left"> As noted in Parts One and Two, some magic items must be
 worn on the body before they can function. Most such items work only 
when they're worn on a specific part of the body (sometimes called an 
item "slot") as noted on page 214 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. 
For example, you cannot wear a magic cloak or shirt on your head and 
expect the item to work. That said, it pays to remember that the game 
includes item slots mostly as a matter of convenience. The item slot 
rules, for example, help you decide if it's possible to wear magic 
gloves under magic gauntlets (if the gauntlets are roomy enough, there's
 no reason you can't wear gloves under them, but in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, you can wear only one pair of the two pairs of items.</p>
<p align="left">The item slot rules also serves to keep characters from 
becoming overpowered (by wearing 10 rings, for example) and gives 
players an important resource to manage.</p>
<p align="left">It's worth noting that the item location rules in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> assume a humanoid body. Nonhumanoid bodies have the same set of 12 item locations noted in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide,</i> though perhaps in slightly different forms. You can find examples in the <i>Draconomicon</i> and in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/re/20031125a">Wild Life, Part Two</a>.</i></p>
<p align="left">It's also worth noting here that a campaign can get 
along without using item slots at all, provided that the DM carefully 
controls the wealth the PCs have. For most campaigns, the wealth 
guidelines on page 135 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> will 
suffice. If you follow those guidelines and you're careful to make sure 
that no single character has significantly more wealth than the all the 
others, you don't need to worry too much about overpowered characters. 
Of course, you'll still face arguments over how many items a character 
can wear on one part of the body.</p>
<p align="left">When your campaign uses the item slot rules (as most do)
 you always can carry more items than you can wear in a particular slot.
 If you wear more items in a slot than will fit, only the first one (or 
the first two, in the case of rings) that you put on functions. As a 
rule of thumb, it takes two move actions to switch around items that you
 wear -- one to shed a functioning item and put it away, and one to get 
out the replacement item and put it on. That assumes that you keep the 
replacement item in some handy location, such as a belt pouch, and that 
you store the original item somewhere equally handy. Note that you can 
just drop an item as a free action, but that's for things you hold in 
your hand. Most items you wear are made to stay in place once you don 
them and it takes a little fiddling to get them off. Armor and shields 
have their own rules for donning and shedding (see Chapter 7 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Saving Throws Against Magic Items Effects </b></p>
<p align="left">Some magic item descriptions include saving throw DCs 
for the effects they produce; however, they usually do so only when the 
item does something that doesn't correspond to a spell.</p>
<p align="left">Most magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. 
For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a magic 
item, the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>gives the following formula: the
 save DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier
 of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell. As it 
happens, that formula works out to a DC 10 plus 1-1/2 times the spell 
level, as shown on the following table:</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">It's important to remember that the item, not the user, 
sets the save DCs for the item's spells or spell-like effects. In most 
cases, this means that the save DC for a spell from an item is almost 
always lower than it would be from a spellcaster.</p>
<p align="left">Staffs are an exception to the rule. Calculate the 
saving throw DC just as if the wielder had cast the spell. If a staff 
user has an ability score lower than necessary to cast a spell stored in
 the staff, the character can still use the spell (provided that the 
character meets the requirements for using a spell trigger item; see 
Part Two), but the character still must use the lower ability modifier. 
As a house rule, you might want to allow a staff user to use his own 
ability modifier or the minimum modifier for the stored spell, whichever
 is higher.</p>
<p align="left">If a staff user has a feat, item, or special ability 
that improves his spell save DCs, those also apply to spell the 
character uses from a staff. For example, if a character has the Spell 
Focus (evocation) feat, the save DC bonus from that feat applies to 
evocation spells the character uses from staffs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Magic Items and Metamagic </b></p>
<p align="left">When an item stores or duplicates a spell effect, the 
item user's metamagic feats (if any) don't apply to the spell. An item 
could produce a spell effect that has been modified with a metamagic 
feat, but only when the item was made that way in the first place. Such 
items are more expensive than items that store regular spells. You can 
see the effect of metamagic on item prices by looking at the prices of 
the wands shown in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<p align="left">Likewise, other feats the item user has (such as the 
Spell Focus feat) do not affect spells produced from items. Staffs are 
an exception (see the previous section), but even a staff does not allow
 the user to apply metamagic feats to spell effects from the staff.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
