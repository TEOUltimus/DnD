<p align="left">Not long ago, it was my pleasure to appear as a guest at
 BashCon on the University of Toledo campus. While there, I had an 
opportunity to discuss the<i> Rules of the Game</i> web feature with a 
roomful of fans. Part of the discussion included an overview of last 
month's column on magical oddities in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game. Based on 
what those fans had to say, it seems that last month's column left quite
 a few oddities unexamined. Here, then, are a few more.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Counterspells</b></p>
<p align="left">A counterspell represents a potent option for any spellcaster who faces another <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>
 user. Unfortunately, many players shy away from counterspells because 
they don't think they understand how counterspells work. That's a shame,
 because there isn't much to using a counterspell. You can find the 
rules governing counterspells on page 170 in the<i> Player's Handbook. </i>The counterspell rules are only a few paragraphs long, but here's a summary of the details, along with additional commentary.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can cast just about any spell as a counterspell. (See the 
Resolving Counterspells section and the notes below on counterspells as 
readied actions for some key exceptions.)<br><br> When you know how to 
cast a spell, you also know how to cast it as a counterspell. Casting a 
spell as a counterspell involves altering the spell slightly so that its
 magical energy suppresses and negates another spell rather than 
producing the spell's usual result.<br><br> Except where noted here, 
casting a counterspell works just like casting a spell. You must 
concentrate to cast a counterspell and your counterspell is ruined and 
wasted if something disrupts your concentration while you're casting. 
When you cast a spell as a counterspell, the spell is used up, just as 
if you had cast the spell normally. You also expend any material or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_experiencepoints')">experience point</a> components the spell normally requires.<br><br></li>
<li>In general, a spell can counter only itself.<br><br> For example, you use a <i>fireball</i> spell to counter another character's <i>fireball</i> spell. Variations on a spell cannot counter each other. For example, you cannot use a <i>fireball</i> spell to counter <i>delayed blast fireball</i> spell or vice versa.<br><br>
 Metamagic generally doesn't affect counterspells because a spell 
altered with a metamagic feat doesn't change a spell into a different 
spell. A maximized <i>fireball</i>, for example, is still a <i>fireball</i> and anyone can use a regular <i>fireball</i>
 spell to counter the maximized spell. You can even counter a spell 
altered with metamagic with the same spell that has been altered with a 
different feat. For example you might counter a maximized <i>fireball</i> spell with an enlarged <i>fireball</i> or a widened <i>fireball</i>.<br><br> Exceptions to these general rules abound. First, some spells naturally counter each other, such as <i>haste</i> and <i>slow</i>. Such pairings are noted in the spells' descriptions.<br><br> Second, the Improved Counterspell feat allows you to counter a spell with any higher <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_level')">level</a> spell of the same school. With the Improved Counterspell feat, for example, you could use <i>delayed blast fireball</i> to counter a <i>fireball</i> spell because both spells are <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_evocation')">evocation</a> spells and <i>delayed blast fireball</i> is a higher level spell than <i>fireball.</i> According to the <b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20030221a">D&amp;D</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20030221a"> FAQ</a>, you can use the Heighten Spell feat to increase a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spelllevel')">spell's level</a> for use with the Improved Counterspell feat. For example, the <i>fireball</i> spell is a 3rd-level evocation spell. <i>Shatter</i> also is an evocation spell, but it's only a 2nd-level spell. If, however, you use Heighten Spell to increase a <i>shatter</i> spell's level to at least 4th level, you can use it to counter a <i>fireball</i> spell if you also have the Improved Counterspell feat.<br><br> Finally, a <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell can be cast as a counterspell. See the Resolving a Counterspell section for details.<br><br></li>
<li>You use the ready action to cast a counterspell.<br><br> A 
counterspell requires you to loose your magic at just the right moment 
to nullify another spell. To manage that trick, you must use the ready 
action, which is described on page 160 of the<i> Player's Handbook.<br><br></i>Because the ready action is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_standardaction')">standard action</a>, you can move up to your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a>
 either before or after you ready your counterspell (but not both). If 
you don't otherwise move during the turn you ready a counterspell, you 
can take a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_5footstep')">5-foot step</a>
 either before or after you ready the counterspell or as part of the 
counterspell itself (but you're still allowed only one 5-foot step in a 
round). See <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i> for details.<br><br> Since you use a standard action as a readied action (see the <i>Player's Handbook)</i>,
 you should use a spell with a casting time of one standard action or 
less as a counterspell (but see the section on counterspell variants in 
Part Two).<br><br></li>
<li>In most cases, you'll need to identify the spell your foe is casting before you can choose the correct counterspell.<br><br> You can identify any spell as it is being cast by making a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">Spellcraft check</a> with a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a>
 of 15 plus the spell's level. This does not require an action (see the 
Spellcraft skill description). You can make a Spellcraft check to 
identify a spell as it is being cast whenever you can see the caster 
performing the spell's somatic components (if any) or when you can hear 
the spell's verbal components (if any). The rules don't say so, but you 
also ought to be able to identify any spell as it is being cast if you 
can see the spell's material components (if any), provided that the 
material component is something unique to the spell. For example, if you
 note a ball of bat guano and sulfur in a spellcaster's hand, that's a 
good indication that a <i>fireball</i> spell is on the way. If your foe is wielding a holy symbol, however, that could indicate any number of divine spells.<br><br>
 In general, it's pretty easy to notice a spell's somatic, verbal, or 
material components as the caster uses them. When in doubt, however, the
 DM can call for a DC 5 Spot or Listen check (as appropriate) to note 
the component. Remember to apply check penalties for distance or other 
conditions as noted in the skill descriptions.<br><br> The rules don't 
come right out and say so, but since you must see a somatic (or 
material) component or hear a verbal component to identify any spell as 
it is being cast, you cannot identify a spell that doesn't have any 
verbal, somatic, or material components. An example of this is a silent 
and stilled spell that doesn't have a material component. This makes 
such spells difficult to counter (but see the next section).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Resolving a Counterspell</b></p>
<p align="left">If you've selected the correct spell to counter another 
character's spell (by using the same spell cast as a counterspell, by 
using a spell that naturally counters the foe's spell [such as using <i>slow</i> to counter <i>haste</i>],
 or by taking advantage of the Improved Counterspell feat), the target 
spell is automatically negated. Neither your spell nor the other 
character's spell has any of its normal results. Instead, the two spells
 completely nullify each other.</p>
<p align="left">If you decide to use a <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell as a counterspell against another spell, success isn't automatic. You target the other spellcaster with your <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, and you must make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_casterlevelcheck')">caster level check</a> with a DC of 11 + the other spellcaster's caster level to successfully counter the other spell. If you use the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, your maximum bonus on your caster level check is +10, as noted in the spell description. If you use the <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, your maximum <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> on your caster level check is +20, also as noted in the spell description.</p>
<p align="left">It's possible to blindly counter another character's spell using a <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i>
 spell as a counterspell. You simply skip the Spellcraft check to 
identify the other character's spell as it is being cast. Failing to 
identify the other character's spell has no affect on your chance to 
counter the spell.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't specifically say so, but you can use a <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell to counter any spell, even a spell that normally isn't subject to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_dispel')">dispelling</a>. For example, you could use a <i>dispel magic </i>spell to counter another character's <i>wall of force</i>
 spell. This works because when you use a counterspell, you're catching 
and disrupting the spell before it actually has any results.</p>
<p align="left">You can also use a <i>dispel magic</i> spell or <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell as a standard counterspell against another <i>dispel magic</i> spell or <i>greater dispel magic</i>
 spell. In this case, you must first identify the opposing spell. If you
 succeed, you can counter the target spell normally, without making a 
caster level check.</p>
<p align="left">There is no saving throw against a counterspell, nor does <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spellresistance')">spell resistance</a> apply to counterspells (because a counterspell affects the target spell, not the spell's caster).</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't specifically say so, but you need to see
 or touch the other spellcaster to counter a spell (because the other 
spellcaster is your counterspell's target). You also need <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofeffect')">line of effect</a>
 to the other spellcaster and the other spellcaster must be within range
 for the spell you're using as a counterspell. If your line of effect is
 blocked or you're out of range, your counterspell's magical energy 
cannot reach the other spellcaster and negate that character's spell. 
This means you cannot use a spell with a personal range as a 
counterspell (because the spell's range is limited to your person) under
 most circumstances. You still can counter another character's personal 
range spell, however, by using a <i>dispel magic</i> or <i>greater dispel magic</i>
 spell as a counterspell, or by taking advantage of the Improved 
Counterspell feat and using a spell with sufficient range to reach your 
opponent.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next?</b></p>

look at various magical effects that negate or suppress each other,
