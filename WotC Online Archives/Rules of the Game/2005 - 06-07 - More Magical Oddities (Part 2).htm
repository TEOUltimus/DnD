<p align="left">You can find general rules for interactions between 
magical effects in several places. Key pieces of text include the 
section entitled Combining Magical Effects on page 171 in the <i>Players Handbook,</i> the text on spell schools on page 172 in the <i>Players Handbook,</i> and the discussion of spell descriptors on page 174 in the <i>Players Handbook.</i><i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a></i> also deals with this topic.</p>
<p align="left">Some of the most important interactions between magical 
effects arise when one effect blocks or negates another effect. 
Unfortunately, the general rules for magical interactions don't cover 
these effects very well. Instead, you must look at the descriptions for 
the individual effects before you can resolve the interaction. This 
week, we'll take a look at a few sample interactions that illustrate 
some principles you can use when considering magic that interferes with 
other magic.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Dispel Magic</b></p>
<p align="left">Understanding the <i>dispel magic</i> spell provides a good basis for understand how antimagic effects work in general. This section provides a summary of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell description along with some additional commentary. Everything noted here also applies to the <i>greater</i><i>dispel magic</i><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a> unless noted otherwise. <i>Dispel magic</i> defeats spells and spell-like effects. Everything here also applies to spell-like effects unless noted otherwise.</p>
<p align="left">You can cast <i>dispel magic</i> three different ways 
(and that alone makes it an unusual spell): As a targeted spell, as an 
area spell, or as a counterspell. The previous two installments in this 
series dealt with counterspells, so let's take a look at <i>dispel magic's </i>other two functions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>As a Counterspell Effect </b></p>
<p align="left">As when casting <i>dispel magic</i> as a counterspell, you must make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_casterlevelcheck')">caster level check</a> with a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> of 11 + the subject spell's caster level to end the subject spell. When using the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, your maximum <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> for the caster level check is +10. When using the <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, your maximum bonus for the caster level check is +20.</p>
<p align="left"><b>As a Targeted Effect </b></p>
<p align="left">When casting a targeted <i>dispel magic,</i> you aim the spell at a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creature</a>,
 object, or spell. You must follow all the rules for selecting a target 
for the spell -- that is, you must be able to see or touch the target 
(see page 175 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a></i>.
 Targeting a creature or object is pretty straightforward. Targeting a 
spell, however, can prove tricky. If the spell you're targeting has a 
visible or tangible effect, you can select the target just by looking at
 it or touching it, as appropriate. If the spell you target is 
intangible, things get a little tougher.</p>
<p align="left">A <i>detect magic</i> spell can determine the location 
of the target spell's magical aura, and you reasonably can assume that 
locating the spell's aura with <i>detect magic</i> is sufficient to target the spell with <i>dispel magic.</i> The <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DM</a> might also allow you to target a specific spell with <i>dispel magic</i> when you can surmise what the spell is. For example, the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_barbarian')">barbarian</a>
 in your group enters a rage and then abruptly freezes in place, not 
attacking. You might sensibly work out that the character is the subject
 of a <i>hold person</i> or <i>hold monster</i> spell, and you could target that spell with <i>dispel magic</i> without first resorting to <i>detect magic</i>.</p>
<p align="left">A targeted <i>dispel magic</i> affects only the target, not other creatures, objects, or spells nearby. If the target is an object or creature, the <i>dispel magic</i> has a chance to end every spell that is currently operating on that object or creature, as noted in the spell's description. A <i>dispel magic </i>targeted on a creature does not also affect the creature's equipment, and a <i>dispel magic</i>
 targeted on a single object in a creature's possession does not affect 
the creature itself or any other objects in its possession. It's worth 
pointing out here that a creature and its equipment usually are treated 
as one entity when the creature receives a spell. For example, when a 
creature receives a <i>displacement</i> spell, both it and its equipment are displaced. Exceptions to this general rule abound, and <i>dispel magic</i> is one of them.</p>
<p align="left">When you aim a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell at a 
particular spell, only that spell is subject to dispelling. This can be 
very helpful when you wish to free an ally of one detrimental spell 
without dispelling any beneficial spells the character has received.</p>
<p align="left">When you select an object as the <i>dispel magic's</i> 
target, you can end every spell or spell-like effect currently operating
 on the object. If the target object is a magic item, you can make a 
caster level check to suppress all the item's magical powers for 1d4 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">rounds</a>, as noted in the <i>dispel magic </i>spell description. An item's nonmagical properties remain unaffected by <i>dispel magic.</i> A <i>+1 longsword</i> suppressed by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell remains a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_masterwork')">masterwork</a> longsword.</p>
<p align="left">If the target object is a magic item that also has 
received one or more spells, you have a chance to end each spell 
currently operating on the item and a chance to suppress all the item's 
magical abilities. The spell description doesn't make this point clear, 
but it's the easiest way to handle things. <i>Dispel magic</i> can't suppress an artifact's magical properties, but it can end spells an artifact has produced.</p>
<p align="left">Aiming a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> at a summoned 
creature proves similar to aiming the spell at a magic item. The spell 
has a chance to banish the summoned creature, as noted in the spell 
description (and in the notes on the summoning subschool on page 173 in 
the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). If the summoned creature also has 
received one or more spells, you have a chance to end each spell, plus a
 chance to banish the summoned creature. If a single summoning effect 
has brought forth multiple creatures and you target your <i>dispel magic</i> spell on one of them, you can banish only the creature you have targeted.</p>
<p align="left"><b>As an Area Effect </b></p>
<p align="left">Instead of casting a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> (or using the spell as a counterspell), you can cast the spell as an area spell that fills a 20-foot burst.</p>
<p align="left">An area dispel can't suppress magic items, but it can 
remove ongoing spells from creatures or objects. For each creature 
within the burst that has received one or more spells, you make a caster
 level check against the spell with the highest <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_casterlevel')">caster level</a>.
 If that check fails, you make checks against progressively weaker 
spells until you dispel one spell or fail all your checks against the 
spells affecting that subject. Once the area <i>dispel magic</i> removes one spell from a subject, it has no further effects on that subject.</p>
<p align="left">An area <i>dispel magic</i> also ends spells operating 
in the same area as the burst. If the burst covers the subject spell's 
point of origin, a successful caster level check from you negates the 
whole effect, even if the burst does not cover the subject effect's 
whole area. See page 175 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a></i> for discussions of a magical effect's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_pointoforigin')">point of origin</a>. If the <i>dispel magic's </i>burst
 merely overlaps the subject spell's area without covering the spell's 
point of origin, a successful caster level check from you negates only 
the portion of the subject spell that the burst covers.</p>
<p align="left">When the burst from an area <i>dispel magic</i> covers 
two or more summoned creatures, make a single caster level check. If the
 check succeeds, you banish each creature the burst covers. If a 
summoned creature also has received one or more spells, your area dispel
 has a chance to remove one spell (as noted previously) and a chance to 
banish the summoned creature.</p>
<p align="left">A targeted or area <i>dispel magic</i> can affect only a
 spell that is currently operating. When a spell has an instantaneous 
duration, it can't be dispelled because the magical effect is already 
over before the <i>dispel magic </i>can take effect.</p>
<p align="left">Some spells aren't subject to <i>dispel magic,</i> as noted in their descriptions (for example, <i>wall of force).</i></p>
<p align="left">A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. 
Usually, this means that the spell ends immediately. Be alert for spells
 that remain for awhile after they expire (for example, the <i>fly</i> spell).</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Opposing Spells </b></p>
<p align="left">Some spells or groups of spells negate each other. For example, <i>haste </i>and <i>slow</i> counter or dispel each other, and the <i>darkness</i> spell can counter or dispel any spell with the light descriptor, provided the subject spell is of an equal or lower level.</p>
<p align="left">When two spells counter or dispel each other, either 
spell can function as a counterspell against the other, as noted in Part
 One.</p>
<p align="left">The rules aren't very clear about what happens when 
opposing spells dispel each other. In general, you can rule that the two
 spells negate each other. When two opposing spells have targets, one 
spell can remove the other when aimed at the same target. Treat the 
second spell just like a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> except that no 
caster level check is required and only the opposing spell is negated. 
For example, if a creature has received a <i>haste</i> spell, targeting a <i>slow</i> spell on the same creature automatically removes the <i>haste</i> effect, leaving the subject neither <i>slowed</i> nor <i>hasted</i>.
 When two opposing spells can affect multiple targets, they only negate 
each other when they share the same targets. For example, when you cast a
 <i>slow</i> spell on six enemies and two of them have received <i>haste</i> effects, the spell removes the two <i>haste</i> effects, leaving the other four targets subject to the <i>slow</i> spell's normal effects.</p>
<p align="left">When two opposing spells have areas, one spell can 
remove the other when aimed at the same area. If the second spell's area
 covers the first spell's point of origin, both spells are completely 
negated (no caster level check is required). If the second spell's area 
of effect merely overlaps the first spell's area without covering the 
spell's point of origin, the two spells negate each other only the area 
where the areas overlap.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Light and Darkness Descriptor Spells:</b> Most spells
 with the light and darkness descriptors have target entries. This means
 that you must aim a spell with the darkness descriptor at the same 
target as a spell with the light descriptor if you want to use the 
former spell to dispel the latter spell. Spells with the light and 
darkness descriptor have an unusual property, however; they cause their 
targets to emit light or darkness and when cast on moveable objects, the
 illuminated or darkened areas also are mobile.</p>
<p align="left">Whenever two such areas are aimed or moved so that the 
areas they affect overlap, the two spells usually temporarily suppress 
each other. This means that the usual light conditions prevail in the 
area of overlap. For example, a <i>daylight</i> spell makes a dim chamber bright with light. A <i>darkness</i>
 spell fills the same room with shadows. If the two spell effects are 
allowed to overlap, there will be an area of dim light in the area of 
overlap bordered on one side (the <i>daylight</i> side) by bright light and on the other (the <i>darkness</i>
 side) by shadowy light. In this case, the two spells otherwise do not 
affect each other. If the two effects move away, both spells work again.</p>
<p align="left">It's also possible that the higher level spell keeps working and the lower level is suppressed. For example, when you cast a <i>darkness</i> spell on an object and then move the object so that the darkened area covers the area where a <i>light</i> spell provides illumination, the lower level <i>light</i> spell stops working until someone moves the <i>darkness</i> effect away.</p>
<p align="left">Though this discussion of mobile spell effects pertains 
to spells with the darkness and light descriptors, you might find it 
helpful when dealing with other mobile spell effects as well.</p>
