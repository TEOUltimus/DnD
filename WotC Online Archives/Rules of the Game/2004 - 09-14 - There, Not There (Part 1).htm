<p align="left">The <b>D&amp;D</b> game is many things to many people, 
but on the whole it's an exercise in the imagination. No matter how many
 pictures or props we use in our games, we still must "see" the game 
world through our minds' eyes. Sometimes, that proves very difficult 
indeed. Invisibility is a concept most of us think we understand, but 
questions about handling unseen creatures always seem to crop up when 
such creatures enter play (and those questions seem to generate more 
trouble than the creatures themselves).</p>
<p align="left">Dealing with ethereal, gaseous, or incorporeal things 
often proves even tougher than dealing with invisibility. How do you 
wrap your mind around something that you couldn't hold in your hand even
 if you had it right there with you?</p>
<p align="left">This article examines all four of these curious states of being.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Some Definitions</b></p>
<p align="left">Here are a few key terms used both in the rules and in 
this article when discussing the unseen and the real, but largely 
untouchable.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adjacent: </b>Two things are adjacent in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game when the squares they occupy share a common side or corner. Because of the way the <b>D&amp;D</b> game counts distances on the grid, two adjacent things are at least 5 feet apart.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Corporeal:</b> Anything that has a physical body or presence. A creature is corporeal if it does not have the incorporeal subtype.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ethereal: </b>Present on the Ethereal Plane (see page 151 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). Creatures on the Ethereal Plane can see into the Material Plane. Divination spells, such as <i>see invisibility,</i>
 allow a user on the Material Plane to see into the Ethereal. Things of 
the Material Plane can have some interactions with things on the 
Ethereal, but because the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane are two 
different places, those interactions are severely limited.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Force:</b> A magical descriptor (see Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Reading Spell Descriptions</a>).
 Force effects that deal damage can harm incorporeal creatures without 
the usual miss chance. Force spells cast on the Material Plane can be 
aimed at, and harm, creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Force barriers 
block incorporeal and ethereal creatures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gaseous:</b> A creature or object whose entire mass 
is a cloud of gas. When something is gaseous, it's still corporeal, but 
it can avoid or ignore many physical barriers or hazards.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Incorporeal:</b> A creature subtype. Incorporeal 
creatures exist without physical bodies and they generally ignore 
physical barriers and physical dangers. The rules sometimes use the 
terms ethereal and incorporeal interchangeably, but they are not 
equivalent (see Part Three and Part Four).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Manifestation:</b> A special quality that allows a 
ghost (an ethereal creature) to partially enter the Material Plane and 
function there as an incorporeal creature does.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Miss Chance:</b> A chance, always expressed as a 
percentage, that an attacker that makes a successful attack roll against
 a foe misses anyway. Miss chances usually arise because the defender is
 concealed in some fashion and the attacker does not know exactly where 
the defender is. A corporeal attacker wielding a magic weapon or spell 
has a miss chance when attacking an incorporeal foe because whether the 
magic can do any harm to the incorporeal foe is strictly a matter of 
chance. (Nonmagical attacks and weaponry cannot harm incorporeal 
creatures at all.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pinpoint: </b>Not a defined game term. When this 
article speaks of pinpointing an unseen creature, it means determining 
where on the battlefield that creature is located; most of the time, 
that's also what the rules mean when they speak of pinpointing a 
creature. Even after pinpointing a creature, you'll still have a miss 
chance when you attack it if you can't actually see it (or perceive it 
through some other means that's at least as acute as vision).</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Invisibility </b></p>
<p align="left"> Invisibility is unlike the other three states of being 
we'll discuss because you really are there (and wholly so) when you 
don't seem to be. The basics of invisibility include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When something is invisible, others cannot perceive that thing with vision.<br><br> Vision in this case includes darkvision.<br><br>
 Nonvisual senses still work with regard to invisible things -- they can
 be felt, heard, and smelled. Special senses such as blindsight, 
blindsense, and tremorsense also work with regard to invisible things.<br><br> Certain spells and magical effects, such as <i>see invisibility</i> and <i>true seeing,</i> allow their users to see invisible things.<br><br>
 Although the rules don't specifically say so, assume that a creature 
using a magical invisibility effect is invisible to others but not to 
itself. This helps avoid arguments about exactly what an invisible 
creature can do without a penalty. Even if you assume an invisible 
creature can see itself, it still does not cast a shadow or a reflection
 (or at least not one most people could notice; see Part Two).<br><br></li>
<li>A magical invisibility effect extends to the user and to all the user's gear.<br><br>
 Your gear includes everything you wear or carry at the time you receive
 the invisibility effect; if something sticks out more than 10 feet from
 you, the portion that extends more than 10 feet is visible.<br><br> If you put down or drop something, that thing becomes visible if it normally is visible.<br><br>
 If you pick up something visible, that thing stays visible unless you 
stick it into your clothing. That said, you can reasonably assume that a
 visible thing becomes invisible if an invisible creature imbibes it.<br><br>
 The rules are unclear about exactly what happens to other creatures 
that you might hold or carry when you become invisible. In general, you 
should treat each creature as a separate individual when you consider 
how any spell or magical effect works. The <i>invisibility</i> and <i>greater invisibility</i> spells affect one creature only, as does a <i>ring of invisibility</i>
 (which works just like the spell). It's reasonable to make an exception
 for creatures you carry tucked into your clothing (or that you pick up 
and tuck into your clothing), and that can include a familiar, cohort, 
or animal companion if the creature is small enough to fit into your 
clothing. Of course, if a familiar, cohort, or animal companion has the 
share spells ability and you (the master) cast an <i>invisibility</i> spell on yourself, you can share that spell with the creature.<br><br>
 If you assume an invisible creature can see itself, it also can see any
 equipment that it carries (unless that equipment is invisible by some 
means other than merely being in the invisible creature's possession).<br><br></li>
<li>Invisibility effects don't make light invisible.<br><br> When you 
receive an invisibility effect, any light source you carry still sheds 
visible light, but the object itself becomes invisible if you're wearing
 or carrying it when you receive the effect.<br><br> If you pick up a 
light source while invisible, both the object and the light it sheds 
remain visible until you tuck it into your clothing, just as any other 
object does.<br><br> The rules don't explain what happens when you carry
 a concealed light source when you become invisible. They also don't say
 what happens if you're invisible and you tuck a light source into your 
clothing. If you follow the rules to the letter, the concealed light 
source just keeps right on shining. In that case, it's best to dump any <i>continual flame</i> effects you might have tucked away in your gear so that their light won't give you away while you're invisible.<br><br>
 On the other hand, it's perfectly reasonable to assume that anything 
that doesn't shed light when you conceal it on your person while visible
 also doesn't shed light when you conceal it on your person while 
invisible. So, for example, if you carry a coin with a <i>continual flame</i>
 spell on it in a belt pouch, where it doesn't shed light, it won't 
start shedding light when you become invisible. If you later pull it out
 of the pouch, but hold onto it, the coin stays invisible, but it sheds 
visible light. Later, you can douse the light by putting the coin back 
into the pouch.<br><br></li>
<li> Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.<br><br> A gaze attack depends on the subject viewing the attacker's face, so your gaze attacks are negated while you're invisible.<br><br> Foes that can see invisible things, such as creatures using the <i>see invisibility</i> or <i>true seeing</i> spell, remain susceptible to your gaze attacks while you're invisible.<br><br></li>
<li>Invisibility does not foil detection spells.<br><br> A detect spell 
doesn't make an invisible creature or object visible, but if an unseen 
subject is in the area where the spell is aimed, the spell can give some
 hint of the unseen subject's presence. For example, a <i>detect magic</i> spell reveals the presence or absence of magical auras in the area where it is aimed. An invisible creature using an <i>invisibility</i> spell or magic item has a magical aura (thanks to the active spell or magic item) and a <i>detect magic</i>
 spell aimed into its area will reveal that aura. All the spell user 
knows, however, is that there is magic present somewhere within the area
 where the spell is aimed. If the <i>detect magic</i> user scans that 
same area for 3 consecutive rounds, the spell can reveal the location of
 the invisible magical aura (if the creature is still in area). The 
spell doesn't reveal anything else about the creature, or even that it 
is a creature at all. The spell user could aim an attack at the 
creature's location and have a chance to hit it (see Part Two).</li>
