<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">This week, we'll take a look at the final three entries in a spell header.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Duration</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The next entry in the spell header tells you how long 
the spell's effects last. In general, a spell's duration begins at the 
time in the round when you finish the spell. Spell duration is discussed
 in detail on page 176 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> This section contains some additional notes on a few kinds of durations.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Instantaneous:</b> A spell with an instantaneous 
duration lasts only for the instant that the spell is completed, though 
its effects can last a long time. For example, a <i>fireball</i> spell is an instantaneous spell, but the damage it deals lasts until something heals or repairs it. <i>Wall of stone</i>
 also is an instantaneous spell. The stone it creates appears in an 
instant, and after that a mass of nonmagical rock remains behind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Because there's no magic operating after the spell takes
 effect, you can't dispel a spell with an instantaneous duration. The 
spell's effects also don't have a magical aura that you can find with <i>detect magic</i> spell (except for a lingering aura that persists for a very short time; see the<i> detect magic </i>spell description).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Recipients, Effects, and Areas:</b> If the spell 
affects recipients directly, the results of the spell travel with the 
subjects for the spell's duration. A spell affects recipients directly 
when the spell has a target or targets entry or when the spell affects 
creatures or objects within an area rather than affecting the whole area
 (see the notes in the section on areas).</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a spell produces an effect, the effect lasts for the duration unless the effect is somehow destroyed first.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the spell affects an area then the spell functions in
 that area for its duration. Recipients become subject to the spell when
 they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave the
 area.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Touch Spells:</b> The duration for a touch spell 
doesn't begin until the caster touches a subject and delivers the spell 
to a recipient. Attempting to touch a recipient requires a melee touch 
attack and that is part of the action used to cast the spell during the 
round when the spell is completed. If the recipient is willing to be 
touched, it's usually best to just assume the caster touches the 
recipient.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the caster does not touch a recipient then (either 
because she doesn't try to or the melee touch attack fails), she must 
use an action (usually the attack or full attack action) to touch a 
recipient during a later round. This is called "holding the charge." A 
caster holding a charge is considered armed and can use an attack of 
opportunity to make a melee touch attack and deliver the spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Whenever the caster touches anything, the held charge is
 discharged, even if what the caster touches isn't a valid target for 
the spell (in that case, the spell is wasted). The charge also is lost 
(and wasted) if the caster casts another spell. Otherwise, a caster can 
hold a charge indefinitely. DMs should feel free to set some reasonable 
limit to how long a character can hold a charge, perhaps 1 hour or until
 the caster has to go to sleep (or trance in the case of elves).</p>
<p align="LEFT">A very few touch spells (<i>water breathing</i>, for 
example) can be partially discharged. If so, this will be mentioned in 
the spell's target entry and its descriptive text, or both. </p>
<p align="LEFT">As a full-round action you can touch up to six friends 
willing creatures, object that willing creatures hold, or objects just 
lying round by themselves), provided that all the recipients are within 
the caster's reach. (The caster can extend her reach a little by taking a
 5-foot step during the process.) To use this option, you must first 
cast the spell and hold the charge. Because the recipients are willing, 
no melee touch attack is required. You must decide how to distribute the
 spell's effect before touching anything.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Saving Throw </b><b></b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The second to last entry in the spell header tells you 
whether the spell's recipient or recipients are allowed saving throws 
against the spell's effects. This is an important piece of information 
because most descriptive text for spells is written with the assumption 
that the recipient's saving throw (if one is allowed) fails. For 
example, the text for <i>charm person </i>says the spell makes a 
humanoid regard you as an ally. It doesn't bother to mention the 
possibility of a successful saving throw because you are assumed to read
 the spell header and know that a saving throw is allowed (in this case 
Will negates, see below).</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a spell allows a saving throw, the entry begins 
with the kind of saving throw the recipient can attempt (Reflex, 
Fortitude, or Will). Types of saving throw entries include the 
following:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Negates: </b>The spell has no effect on a recipient who makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the spell has no obvious physical effects (and most 
spells that allow saves to negate don't), a recipient that makes a 
successful saving throw still feels an obviously hostile force or 
tingle. If the spell has a target or targets entry, the caster knows 
that the spell has failed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A recipient who makes a successful saving throw doesn't 
know where the spell came from (though that might be obvious if the 
caster is visible) or what the spell was. If the spell has a target or 
targets entry, however, a recipient that makes a successful saving throw
 can attempt a Spellcraft check (DC 25 plus the spell level) to 
determine what the spell was. This does not take an action, and the 
recipient cannot retry the check if it fails.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Charm person</i> is a good example of this kind of spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Partial:</b> The spell causes an effect on its 
subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs.
 The descriptive text in the spell covers both the full and partial 
effect.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Entangle </i>is a good example of this kind of spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Half:</b> The spell deals damage, and a successful 
saving throw halves the damage of the recipient (round down). If the 
save allowed is a Reflex save, a recipient with the evasion class 
feature takes no damage on a successful saving throw. If the save 
allowed is a Reflex save, a recipient with the improved evasion class 
feature takes half damage even on a failed save and no damage on a 
successful saving throw (provided that the recipient isn't helpless).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Fireball </i>is a good example of this kind of spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>None:</b> No saving throw is allowed (and enough said). </p>
<p align="left"><b>Disbelief:</b> A successful save lets a creature 
ignore the effect. Spells that allow this kind of saving throw usually 
are from the illusion school, and they usually don't have any direct 
effects on creatures or objects, but instead have effect or area 
entries. Creatures make their disbelief saves upon interacting with the 
area or effect in some fashion. The rules don't give any guidelines on 
what kind of interaction is required. As a rule of thumb, a creature 
interacts with something upon attacking it, studying it, touching it, 
talking to it, or doing something else that one might do with a real 
creature or object. Merely looking at something usually doesn't qualify 
as interaction, but using an action (standard or full-round) to study or
 identify it does. Sometimes a disbelief save is automatic, such as when
 a character tries to touch an illusory wall and his hand passes right 
through it (see page 173 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Silent image</i> is a good example of this kind of spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Object:</b> When a saving throw entry ends with this 
notation, it indicates that the spell can be aimed at an object (most 
spells that have this notation have a target entry). A reminder is in 
order here -- these spells don't necessarily only affect objects (though
 some do).</p>
<p align="LEFT">An object that receives the spell gets a saving throw 
only if it is magical or if a creature wears or carries the object. See 
page 177 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for details.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Undetectable alignment</i> is a good example of this kind of spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Harmless:</b> When a saving throw entry ends with 
this notation, it indicates that the spell usually is beneficial, not 
harmful. The recipient can attempt a saving throw if it desires.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Darkvision </i>is a good example of this kind of spell.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spell Resistance</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The final entry in the spell header tells you if the 
spell must overcome spell resistance (if any) to affect the recipient. 
If the entry is "no" then the spell most likely does not affect the 
recipient directly, but instead either affects an area or produces an 
effect which then produces the spell's result. Most spells that work 
only on willing creatures also have a spell resistance entry of "no" 
because it is assumed that a willing creature lowers its spell 
resistance before receiving the spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the spell entry is "yes," the spell usually goes to 
work directly on the recipient's mind or body and the caster must make a
 level check to overcome spell resistance before the spell can affect 
the creature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next? </b><b></b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Next week, we'll consider a spell's descriptive text and wind up our look into spells with a few notes about spell chains.</p>
