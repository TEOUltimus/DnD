<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="590">
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">You must aim a spell somewhere before it can affect anything.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Target or Targets, Effect, or Area</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The next entry in the spell header explains how you aim the spell, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> Target or Targets: You select one or more recipients to receive the
 spell. All your targets must be in range and you must have line of 
effect to them. If you don't have line of sight to a recipient, you 
still can select it as a target if you can touch it.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Often, the entry will limit the kinds of targets you can
 select. For example, living creatures, objects, or willing creatures. A
 creature is anything that has both a Wisdom and a Charisma score. A 
living creature also has a Constitution score.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An object is anything that lacks a Wisdom and a Charisma
 score, even if it is actually alive. (A rose bush, for example, is 
alive, but it's an object insofar as the <b>D&amp;D</b> rules are concerned.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">A willing creature must declare itself willing, which it
 can do anytime, even during someone else's turn or when flat-footed. 
Declaring oneself willing is not an action. Likewise, you can declare 
yourself unwilling anytime. Unconscious creatures are automatically 
willing. Helpless, but conscious creatures (such as paralyzed creatures)
 still can declare themselves willing or unwilling.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes, you can choose targets only within some sort 
of limited area. The rules usually use one of two different kinds of 
wording to indicate that. For example, the targets entry for the <i>animal growth</i>
 spell is as follows: "Up to one animal (Gargantuan or smaller) per two 
levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart."And the targets 
entry for the <i>animal shapes</i> spell is as follows: "Up to one 
willing creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other." Usually, 
when the rules say things in different ways, they mean different things,
 but not in this case. All the targets you choose must be with the 
specified distance of all the other targets, and any target that is more
 than the specified distance from even one other target can't be 
selected as a target. To put it another way, imagine a sphere with a 
diameter (not radius) equal to the specified distance. All the targets 
you choose must fit within that sphere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the targets entry specifies a number of targets 
based on level (as both the previous examples do), that refers to your 
caster level (see Part One).</p>
<ul>
<li> Effect: The spell produces something by either creating it on the 
spot or by summoning it from somewhere else. When an effect spell 
summons a creature, the spell's range determines how far away from you 
the creature can appear. Once it appears, however, the creature is free 
to move around as it likes or as you direct; the spell range no longer 
limits it. The same goes for summoned objects; though most objects can't
 move around on their own, someone could hurl the object or carry it 
off.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><i>Wall Spells: </i>Spells such as <i>wall of fire</i> 
are effect spells that create barriers. Often, the effect entry for such
 a spell does not mention how thick the barrier is (for example, <i>blade barrier, wall of fire,</i> and <i>wall of force</i>).
 In these cases, the wall is basically two-dimensional, with only a 
negligible thickness. If such a spell deals damage (or has some other 
effect), the spell deals damage to anything that passes through it or 
otherwise breaks the plane of the barrier. In the case of a <i>wall of force, </i>nothing can break the plane (save for a few magical effects specified in the spell description).</p>
<ul>
<li> Area: The spell (usually) fills some volume of space as specified 
in the entry. As noted earlier, a spell's area cannot extend beyond the 
spell's range. Most spells have immobile areas, so you cannot move after
 casting the spell and make the area extend farther or shift around. (If
 a spell's effects are mobile, it usually will have an effect entry 
instead of an area entry.) As noted in Part Two, most figment spells 
have fixed areas. The images you create as part of a figment can move 
around, but only within the spell's area.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">When you aim an area spell, you must choose a point of 
origin (see Part One) for the spell. You must have line of effect to the
 point of origin you choose. If you cannot see the point of origin, you 
must specify the point of origin in some meaningful way. The best way to
 do so is select a distance and a direction from yourself or from 
another point of reference that you can see or touch (or that your DM 
agrees is well known to you). The point of origin for any area spell 
always must be an intersection of squares on the grid you use to 
regulate combat. This rule greatly simplifies the task of deciding 
exactly where the area extends. Once you choose the point of origin, the
 spell's area extends from there. The most common area shapes include 
the following:</p>
<p align="left"><i>Burst or Emanation:</i> The area extends from the 
point of origin in a sphere whose radius is specified in the entry 
(though some bursts are cone-shaped areas). Anything that blocks line of
 effect from the point of origin also blocks the burst or emanation.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a burst or emanation spell is aimed into a location 
that's too small to hold the entire sphere (or cone), the spell still 
works, but its area will be only as large as the space allows.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A caster can aim a burst or emanation spell at a 
location where only part of its area is blocked. In this case, the 
unblocked portion of the spell's area will be its normal size, and the 
blocked portion extends only as far as the obstacle that blocks line of 
effect from the spell's point of origin.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Spread:</i> A spread is similar to a burst, except 
that it can turn corners. When line of effect from the point of origin 
is blocked, just go around the obstacle, tracing a path that's as long 
as the spread's radius. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The rules don't tell you what to do when whatever blocks the spread's line of effect isn't a solid object (for example, an <i>antimagic field</i>). In this case, just the treat the <i>antimagic field</i> like a solid obstacle<i>.</i> A spell with a spread area and the sonic descriptor will spread around a <i>silence</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Cone:</i> A cone is a quarter circle that extends 
from the caster's space for the distance stated in the entry. If the 
caster's space fills only one square, the cone can start at any corner 
of the space (that corner is the spell's point of origin). The rules are
 silent about what to do when the caster's space fills more than one 
square. I recommend you pick any grid intersection on the outer edge of 
the space as the point of origin for the spell. Alternatively, you can 
require the caster to choose a corner of his space as the point of 
origin.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Anything that blocks line of effect from the point of 
origin blocks the cone, and a cone can be only partly blocked, as noted 
above.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Cylinder:</i> A cylindrical area is something like a 
spread. The area extends from the point of origin in a horizontal 
circle, and then extends downward. The rules say a cylinder ignores 
obstructions in its area, which isn't too helpful. In effect, this means
 that line of effect for a cylinder isn't blocked so long as you can 
trace an unbroken line from the point of origin without leaving the 
confines of the cylinder. (You still need line of effect from you to 
spell's point of origin, however.)</p>
<p align="left"><i>Line:</i> A line's point of origin is one corner of 
the caster's space. (If the caster's space fills more than one square, 
you can use the optional rule suggested for cones to select the point of
 origin.) The line extends from the point of origin in any direction the
 caster chooses and reaches as far as the spell's range (or until its 
line of effect is blocked). The rules regarding lines are somewhat 
muddled; however, a line affects anything in a square that the line 
passes though or touches. So, if you send a line straight down a 
gridline, it will affect the squares to either side of the line. Some 
people like to limit a line's effects to a width of 5 feet. If so, the 
caster chooses which side of the line gets affected when a line passes 
between two squares. (Choose a side when you aim the spell, and once you
 choose, you have to stick with that side.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you have to deal with a line aimed into the air, it's
 easiest to assume that a line affects anything in a 5-foot cube that 
the line passes through or touches.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Creatures or Objects:</i> These spells work like 
targeted spells. They affect their subjects directly rather than filling
 a volume of space, but all the subjects must fit into the area 
specified in the entry.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Cubes:</i><b></b>These areas specify a number of 
cubes. Usually the caster can arrange the cubes any way she likes, and 
this is indicated by (S) after the entry. The rules are silent on 
exactly how you can arrange the cubes. At the minimum, however, the 
cubes all must touch each other (that is share a corner, edge, or side 
with at least one other cube). No cube can extend farther from you than 
the spell's range, and you must be able to trace line of effect from at 
least one point in a cube back to the spell's point of origin through 
the other cubes in the area. The rules say a cube can't have a dimension
 smaller than 10 feet. Technically, that means you can't cast a spell 
with a cubical area in any location with a dimension smaller than 10 
feet. If that seems harsh to you (it does to me), assume that a cube 
must have a dimension of at least 10 feet if space allows. The absolute 
minimum dimension for a cube in a restricted space is 1 foot -- barriers
 with openings smaller than that block line of effect, as noted in Part 
One.</p>
