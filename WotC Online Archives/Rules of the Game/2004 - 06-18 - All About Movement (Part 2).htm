<p align="left">Last time, we looked at the basic rules of movement and 
looked at a few definitions. Let's take a look at move actions this 
time.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Movement and Move Actions </b></p>
<p align="left">As we saw in Part One, you move whenever you go from one
 place on a battlefield to another. Usually, you move as a move action. 
Unfortunately, you sometimes use a move action and don't move at all, 
and sometimes you use a full-round action or a miscellaneous action to 
move. In Part Two, we'll look at moving and move actions.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Move Actions </b></p>
<p align="left">It's important to remember that you don't always "move" 
when you take a move action. When a move action doesn't actually 
constitute movement, you can take a 5-foot step during a round when you 
perform one of these actions (provided you don't otherwise move during 
the same turn). Many of these actions provoke attacks of opportunity 
(all by themselves; move actions that actually involve movement can 
provoke attacks of opportunity if the creature using the action moves 
out of a threatened square. Here's a quick recap of move actions:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Move: </b>A move is the basic act of moving your 
speed across the battlefield. You can't take a 5-foot step during the 
same round that you move. If you leave a threatened square while moving,
 you provoke attacks of opportunity, though there are numerous 
exceptions that we won't go into here.</p>
<p align="left">Several skills either require you to move or are included in your movement (see Part 3).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Control a Frightened Mount: </b>You use this action 
when you're in battle on a mount that is not trained for war. You make a
 Ride check to control the mount. The check is a move action for you, 
but it does not necessarily involve movement. If your mount does not 
move, then your action to control doesn't count as movement for you. 
Since you must devote your attention to the mount, this action provokes 
attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">If you're successful with your Ride check, you can 
direct your mount to move, stand still, or do anything else it normally 
could do while carrying a rider. If you direct the mount to move, your 
check to control it and the mount's movement are part of the same 
action, and you still can perform a standard action during the round. If
 your check fails, the mount does what it will (probably fleeing from 
danger as fast as it can); you cannot take another actions and the 
failed check ends your turn (but see Part 3).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Direct or Redirect an Active Spell: </b>Some spells, such as <i>spiritual weapon, flaming sphere,</i> and <i>animate rope </i>produce
 effects you can direct as a move action. This does not provoke attacks 
of opportunity and it does not count as movement for you. Note that some
 spells, such as <i>detect magic</i> and <i>arcane eye, </i>require 
concentration, not mere direction. Concentrating on a spell is a 
standard action, not a move action. Check the spell description 
carefully to find out which action (if any) the spell requires.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Draw a Weapon: </b>Use this action to draw out a 
sheathed weapon or other item that your DM agrees is reasonably 
weaponlike and stored in a holster or other convenient place where you 
can grab it and pull it out quickly. This does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity and it does not count as movement for you. If you have a 
base attack bonus of +1 or more, you can draw a weapon as part of your 
movement. That is, you can use a move action to move up to your speed 
and also draw a weapon as part of that move action. If you have a base 
attack bonus of +1 or more and you don't move, you still have to use a 
move action to draw a weapon. The rule reflects the flow of time in the 
game and the relative ease of drawing a weapon if you have even a 
modicum of fighting ability. Note that this rule applies only to drawing
 weapons and not to move actions in general.</p>
<p align="left">If you have the Two-Weapon fighting feat, you can draw two one-handed or light weapons as a move action, or as part of movement.</p>
<p align="left">The Quick Draw feat allows you to draw a weapon as a 
free action (whether you also move or not); if you have the Two-Weapon 
Fighting feat, the Quick Draw feat allows you to draw two 1-handed or 
light weapons as a free action.</p>
<p align="left">If you have an item (even a weapon) stored away in a backpack, you must use the retrieve a stored item action instead.</p>
<p align="left">You can draw ammunition for a projectile weapon as a 
free action, provided you've got it stored in a quiver or some other 
convenient place.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Load a Hand or Light Crossbow:</b> You use this 
action when you cock and load a hand or light crossbow (loading a new 
clip into a repeating crossbow is a full-round action). Loading doesn't 
count as movement, but it provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Open or Close a Door: </b>You use this for opening or
 closing just about any portal of approximately your size or smaller. 
Opening a garden gate, a desk drawer, or the door to your house is a 
move action for you. So is picking a lock. Portals bigger than you may 
require full-round actions or even several full-round actions.</p>
<p align="left">Just opening or closing a door (or other closure) 
doesn't constitute movement, and the act doesn't provoke attacks of 
opportunity. The DM might decide, however, that opening a really big or 
stubborn door counts as moving a heavy object (see below).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mount or Dismount a Steed: </b>Use this action to 
climb aboard a mount or get off. The act of mounting of dismounting 
doesn't count as movement for you; however, you must enter your mount's 
space to mount or exit the mount's space to dismount. You can enter or 
exit the mount's space as a 5-foot step (if the situation allows a 
5-foot step) or as part of your normal movement. For example if your 
speed is 30 and your mount is 30 feet away or less, you use one move 
action to reach the mount's space and a second move action to mount (see
 Part 3 for more on the Ride skill).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Move a Heavy Object:</b> Use this action to drag 
something (a treasure chest, an unconscious ally, or a slain monster's 
carcass), push something (a loaded cart or a barn door), or manhandle 
something big and bulky into position (a statue or a banquet table). You
 and whatever you're moving travel across the battlefield, so moving a 
heavy object counts as movement. Since moving something heavy usually 
occupies your full attention, the very act of moving the object provokes
 attacks of opportunity. In addition, if you leave a threatened square 
while moving, you also provoke attacks of opportunity for doing that.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't give movement rates for moving heavy 
objects or for dragging things, but as a rule of thumb, there's no 
effect on your movement if what you're moving weighs less than your 
light load rating. You move as though encumbered if you move something 
that weighs more than your light load rating but no more than your 
maximum heavy load. If you use the dragging rule (see page 162 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>) to move something that exceeds your maximum load, you move at half speed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pick Up an Item:</b> This action generally involves 
stooping down and pick up something from the floor. Doing so doesn't 
count as movement, but it provokes attacks of opportunity. Grabbing 
something stored in a handy location (such as a tabletop or rack) might 
be a free action and might not provoke attacks of opportunity, depending
 on how generous your DM is feeling.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sheathe a Weapon: </b>Use this action whenever you 
have to put something away fairly carefully. Sheathing a weapon doesn't 
count as movement, but it takes some care and attention, so it provokes 
attacks of opportunity. Just stuffing something into your pocket or into
 a bag you have in your hand is a free action that doesn't provoke 
attacks of opportunity. In the latter case, you'll need a move action to
 locate and retrieve the stored item.</p>
<p align="left">The Quick Draw feat does not allow you to sheathe a weapon as a free action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stand Up from Prone: </b>Use this action to get up 
when you're lying on the ground. This does not count as movement, but 
you're pretty darn close to defenseless when regaining your feet, so 
standing up provokes attacks of opportunity. Getting to your feet when 
seated on the ground is just as difficult as getting up from a prone 
position and also requires a move action that provokes attacks of 
opportunity. If you're kneeling on the ground, getting up takes some 
time, but it doesn't make you vulnerable, so you use a move action that 
doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Getting up from a chair is a 
free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity if the chair is 
fairly high; otherwise it's just like getting up from a prone position.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ready or Loose a Shield: </b>Use this action when you
 strap a shield to your arm (or grab a buckler) to claim its shield 
bonus to Armor Class. Likewise, you can loose a shield and sling it over
 your back. You lose the shield's bonus to Armor Class (the check 
penalty from the shield still applies though), but you have your hand 
free and the shield is hanging there, ready to use with another move 
action. Readying or loosing a shield takes time, but isn't too 
complicated, so it does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or more, you can 
ready or loose a shield as part of your movement. That is, you can use a
 move action to move up to your speed and also ready or loose a shield 
as part of that move action. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or 
more and you don't move, you still have to use a move action to ready or
 loose a shield.</p>
<p align="left">If you've already loosed your shield (or you're just carrying it), you can drop it as a free action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Retrieve a Stored Item: </b>Use this action to dig 
something out of your pack or grab something that is stored in some 
other fairly accessible but somewhat unhandy location, such as a purse, 
belt pouch, or cluttered tabletop. This doesn't count as movement, but 
it occupies enough of your attention to provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">A spell component pouch is fitted with all sorts of 
handy pockets and compartments, which your character is assumed to keep 
fairly neat and organized. Getting components from a spell component 
pouch is part of the casting time for the spell and doesn't require a 
separate action. If you're grappled, however, it takes a full-round 
action to draw out a spell component.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>When Moving Isn't a Move Action </b></p>
<p align="left">Several actions fit our definition of "movement" but are
 not move actions. Unless noted otherwise, you can't also take a 5-foot 
step during a turn when you use one of these actions. Here's a recap:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Withdraw:</b> As a full-round action you can move up 
to double your speed; you can move in any direction you normally could 
move (including toward an enemy), and the first square you leave is not 
considered threatened. If you leave any additional threatened squares, 
however, you provoke attacks of opportunity normally. When withdrawing, 
you must use a mode of movement for which you have a speed rating (see 
next section). Withdrawing is a full-round action no matter how far you 
choose to move. You can't do anything else (except take free actions) 
during the turn when you withdraw.</p>
<p align="left">If you're limited to only a standard action during your 
turn, you can withdraw as a standard action, moving up to your speed. If
 you're capable of using a full-round action, you must use a full-round 
action to withdraw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Run: </b>If your movement is not hampered and you're 
not reduced to half speed (see Part One), you can run as a full-round 
action. You move up to four times your speed in a straight line (or up 
to three times your speed if you're in heavy armor or carrying a heavy 
load).</p>
<p align="left">Running represents an all-out effort to move as fast as 
possible, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) when 
running -- you're putting your effort into speed, not defense. Running 
by itself doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, but you are moving 
when running and you provoke attacks of opportunity if you leave a 
threatened square while running.</p>
<p align="left">If you use a grid to regulate movement in your games, 
don't take the requirement for running in a straight line too literally.
 It's often impossible to move from space to space on a grid and 
maintain a perfectly straight line. Draw or trace a straight line from 
any corner of the moving creature's starting space to any portion of the
 creature's intended ending space. So long as the creature sticks to 
spaces that the line passes though or touches, it is moving in a 
"straight" line for purposes of the run action.</p>
<p align="left">Technically, creatures that lack Constitution scores can run forever (see page 312 in the <i>Monster Manual),</i> but many creatures cannot run at all -- check their descriptions to be sure.</p>
<p align="left">Though the rules don't say so, there's no good reason 
why you cannot run as a standard action if you're limited to only a 
standard action during your turn. If you're capable of using a 
full-round action, you must use a full-round action to run.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Move 5 Feet through Difficult Terrain: </b>As noted on page 144 in the<i> Player's Handbook, </i>a
 creature that is otherwise mobile might encounter a situation in which 
its movement is so hampered that it cannot move even one space. Such a 
creature can move 5 feet (one space) in any direction as a full-round 
action. Moving this way is not a 5-foot step. If a creature using this 
rule leaves a threatened square, it provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">It's worth repeating here that you cannot use this rule 
to move through impassible areas (such as solid walls), or move when 
you're immobilized.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Take a 5-Foot Step:</b> You're moving when you take a
 5-foot step. You can't take a 5-foot step during a round when you 
perform any other movement, and you cannot take a 5-foot step if your 
movement is hampered, if your movement is reduced to half speed, or if 
your current speed is 5 feet or less. As with the withdraw action, you 
must use a mode of movement for which you have a speed rating.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bull Rush:</b> As a standard action, you move up to 
your speed. To perform the bull rush you must move into your opponent's 
space at some point during your move. If you wish to push your opponent 
back more than 5 feet, you must have some movement left when you enter 
you opponent's space (see the bull rush description on page 154 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="left">You can bull rush as part of a charge. If you do, you 
perform the bull rush instead of attacking your foe and you get a +2 
bonus on your Strength check (see page 155 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Charge:</b> As a full-round action you can move up to
 twice your speed directly toward a foe and make a single melee attack 
when you reach the foe. You must move at least 10 feet to the closest 
square from which you can attack your opponent and you must move to that
 square by the shortest path. If that path takes you through an obstacle
 or terrain that hampers your movement (including friendly creatures), 
you cannot charge. Though you normally cannot charge into or through a 
space that contains another creature, you can charge as part of a bull 
rush action.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot charge if you're reduced to half speed. If 
you're capable of using only a standard action during your turn, you can
 charge as a standard action.</p>
<p align="left">The procedure for charging is slightly different when you're using the Ride-By Attack feat (see Part 6).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Overrun:</b> As with a bull rush, you move up to your
 speed as a standard action and you enter your opponent's space during 
your move. If you knock your opponent down with your overrun, you can 
keep moving through your opponent's space if you have any movement left 
(see the overrun description on page 157 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="left">You cannot perform an overrun as part of a charge (see the<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20040125a">Player's Handbook</a></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20040125a"> errata file</a>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Grapple: </b>To maintain a hold you've established 
with a successful grapple check, you must enter your foe's space. 
Likewise, creatures with the improved grab special attack drag their 
victims into their spaces after establishing holds. Neither movement 
counts against a creature's movement for the turn. If you've already 
moved your speed or taken a 5-foot step, you still can move into a foe's
 space to maintain a hold and you still can be dragged into an 
attacker's space after it has grabbed you with improved grab.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next?</b></p>
<p align="left">Now that we've covered move actions, let's take a look at how speed and skills can affect or are affected by movement.</p>
