<p align="left">The current rules for the <b>D&amp;D</b> game give players and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DMs</a> tremendous opportunities for creating unique <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">characters</a> and unexpected challenges. If you want to play a troll <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cleric')">cleric</a>/<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rogue')">rogue</a>,
 you can. If you want to bedevil your players with a rakshasa rogue, you
 can. Unfortunately, when you start mixing monsters with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_classlevel')">class levels</a> you can find yourself descending into a maze of rules and numbers that could make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_paladin')">paladin</a> curse.</p>
<p align="left"> This series delves into the fine art of creating monstrous <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a> and creating monsters with class levels as foes for player characters. Much of the material presented here was drawn from the <b>D&amp;D</b> 3.0 FAQ, and it still holds true in v.3.5.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Some Key Terms</b></p>
<p align="left">One of the biggest hurdles players and DMs face when 
dealing with monsters is making sense of all the terms the game uses 
when dealing with the subject. All of these terms mean very different 
things (or there wouldn't be separate terms), but many of them look and 
sound the same. Here are several terms we'll examine in depth in this 
series:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bonus Feat:</b> An extra feat a creature gains 
outside of its normal allotment. A bonus feat might allow a creature to 
choose any feat (for example, the bonus feat a human gains at 1st 
level). A bonus feat also might be restricted to a short list or even be
 restricted to a single feat. (For example, a 1st-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_monk')">monk</a> can select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat.)</p>
<p align="left"> Sometimes, a creature can have a bonus feat without meeting the feat's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_prerequisite')">prerequisites</a>.
 When this is the case, the bonus feat's source will say so. For 
example, a monk can select bonus feats from the list the class offers at
 1st, 2nd, and 6th <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_level')">levels</a> without meeting any prerequisites for those feats (see the monk class description).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Class Level: </b>The total number of levels a creature has in a class. For example, a 5th-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fighter')">fighter</a> has 5 class levels in the fighter class. A 5th-level fighter/5th-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_wizard')">wizard</a> has 5 class levels in fighter and 5 class levels in wizard.</p>
<p align="left">Class level affects many things. See Part Two for a comprehensive look at class level.</p>
<p align="left">The term "class level" and "<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDie')">Hit Dice</a>" are often used interchangeably (especially when dealing with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a>
 and other magical effects) because a class level provides a creature 
with a Hit Die. Class levels and Hit Dice, however, are not really the 
same thing. A Hit Die is something a creature can have by virtue of its 
race and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a>. A class level has to be earned through experience.</p>
<p align="left"><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_characterlevel')">Character Level</a><b>:</b> The total number of class levels a creature has, plus any racial Hit Dice the creature has.</p>
<p align="left">A human 5th-level fighter/5th-level wizard has 10 class 
levels. An ogre 5th-level fighter/5th-level wizard has 14 class levels 
(10 class levels plus 4 racial Hit Dice).</p>
<p align="left">Character levels determine when a creature gains feats and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilityscore')">ability score</a> increases (see Table 3-2 in the<i> Player's Handbook</i>).
 Any feats a creature gets by virtue of its character levels are in 
addition to any bonus feats it has from its race or from its class 
levels.</p>
<p align="left"> In addition, character level determines how much 
experience a character earns when he defeats a foe and how many 
experience points he needs to gain his next class level.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 181 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Hit Dice: </b>The term "Hit Dice" is used 
synonymously with "character levels" for effects that affect a number of
 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, 
not from classes, have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Challenge Rating (CR):</b> Challenge Rating reflects a
 game designer's best judgment about how tough a monster will prove in a
 fight. The CRs of all the creatures in an encounter help to determine 
the encounter's Encounter Level (see Chapter 3 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left">When characters defeat a creature, the creature's CR is a
 starting point for determining each character's experience award for 
the victory. You must compare the defeated monster's CR with each 
character's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_effectivecharacterlevel')">effective character level</a> or ECL (see pages 36-37 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide).</i></p>
<p align="left">The experience award a character receives for a 
particular defeated monster is the same no matter what the encounter's 
EL was (but see Modifying XP Awards on page 39 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Effective Character Level (ECL):</b><i></i>Character level plus the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_leveladjustment')">level adjustment</a>
 for the character's race. For example, a drow has a level adjustment of
 +2. Many people (and even one or two rulebooks) say ECL when they 
really mean level adjustment.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 172 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left">Add a monster's level adjustment to its Hit Dice and 
class levels to get the creature's effective character level, or ECL. 
Effectively, monsters with a level adjustment become multiclass 
characters when they take class levels. Characters with more than 1 Hit 
Die because of their race do not get a feat for their first class level 
as members of the common races do, and they do not multiply the skill 
points for their first class level by four. Instead, they have already 
received a feat for their first Hit Die because of race, and they have 
already multiplied their racial skill points for their first Hit Die by 
four. Use ECL instead of character level when referring to Table 3-2: 
Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> 
to determine how many experience points a monster character needs to 
reach its next level. Also use ECL with Table 5-1: Character Wealth by 
Level to determine starting wealth for a monster character.</p>
<p align="left">Monster characters treat skills mentioned in their <i>Monster Manual</i> entry as class skills.</p>

<p align="left"><b>From page 36 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left">A Challenge Rating is a measure of how easy or difficult
 a monster or trap is to overcome. Challenge Ratings are used in Chapter
 3: Adventures to determine Encounter Levels (EL), which in turn 
indicate how difficult an encounter (often involving multiple monsters) 
is to overcome. A monster is usually overcome by defeating it in battle,
 a trap by being disarmed, and so forth.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Encounter Level (EL):</b> Encounter Level is strictly
 a tool for the DM to use when deciding if an encounter is too easy, 
about right, or too hard for a particular group of characters. It has no
 real effect on play. Some people think that Encounter Level determines 
how much experience character can gain from an encounter, but that's not
 so (see Challenge Rating).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Feat:</b> A special trait or ability that either 
gives a creature a new capability or improves one the creature already 
has. A creature has one feat for its first class level or Hit Die, and 
gains one more feat at each level or Hit Dice that is evenly divisible 
by three. Table 3-2 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> shows feats player characters get as they gain levels.</p>
<p align="left">A creature can gain extra (bonus) feats from its race, class, or from some other source.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hit Die or Hit Dice:</b> The die (or collection of 
dice) rolled to determine a creature's hit points. A creature's Hit Dice
 can come from its race, from its class (or classes), or both.</p>
<p align="left">A creature's total Hit Dice also serves as a measure of 
its overall power. Many spells can affect creatures with a certain 
number of Hit Dice (including dice from class levels) or lower. Other 
spells can affect creatures whose total Hit Dice (or levels plus Hit 
Dice) don't exceed a specified total.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Level Adjustment:</b> A value assigned to a creature from a nonstandard race to help promote some equity among the player characters in a campaign.</p>
<p align="left">When a character has a level adjustment, use the 
character's ECL (character level plus level adjustment) to determine the
 character's starting equipment and how the character earns and benefits
 from experience, as noted on page 172 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i> Use the actual character level for just about everything else (see Part Two).</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next? </b><b></b></p>
<p align="left">That's all the time we have this week. Next week, we'll 
consider the ins and outs of class levels, character levels, and the 
like.</p>
