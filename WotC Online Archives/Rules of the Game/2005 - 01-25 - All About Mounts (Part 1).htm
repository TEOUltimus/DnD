<p align="left">In a world that lacks mechanized transportation, such as the typical <b>D&amp;D</b>
 campaign world, mounts provide the basic means of transportation. 
Normally, climbing aboard a steed and riding off to some destination, 
near or far, doesn't pose much of a problem for players and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_dungeonmaster')">DMs</a>. Unfortunately, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a>
 seldom take quiet rides in the country -- they tend to find trouble. 
This series focuses on how a mount functions during the rigors of 
adventuring. </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Basics of Mounts </b></p>
<p align="left">The basics of mounts are well scattered through the 
rules. Important stops on our road to understanding mounts include the 
description of the Ride <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skill')">skill</a> on page 80 in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> the rules for mounted combat on page 157 of the<i> Player's Handbook,</i> and the rules for mounts on pages 204-205 in the<i> Dungeon Master's Guide</i>. Here's an overview:</p>
<ul>
<li> A mount must be at least one <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a> category bigger than the rider.<br><br> Many <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creatures</a> have the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> to carry another creature of the same size category, but the game places severe restrictions on which creatures can share <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_space')">space</a> on the battlefield with others (see next point).<br><br>
 Even if a creature is one or more size categories bigger than you, it 
can't serve as your mount if it lacks the Strength to carry you and your
 gear.<br><br></li>
<li>A mount and rider share the same space on the battlefield.<br><br> 
For all game purposes, you and your mount function as a single unit on 
the battlefield. Your mount continues to use its own space and reach 
while carrying you. You effectively use your mount's space and your own 
reach (or whatever extended reach your weapon gives you) while mounted. 
While you're mounted, any <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a> that can reach a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_square')">square</a>
 in the space you and your mount jointly occupy can affect you or your 
mount (it doesn't make a difference which square). Likewise, you measure
 your reach for your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee attacks</a> and the range for your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ranged%20attack')">ranged attacks</a> from any square you and your mount jointly occupy. You don't get <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cover')">cover</a>
 from your mount unless you use the Ride skill to get it, and your mount
 doesn't block your attacks and provide your foes with cover.<br><br> Normally, you and an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ally')">ally</a> cannot share the same space on the battlefield unless one of you is <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_helpless')">helpless</a> or a lot bigger than the other (see page 148 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and page 29 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide).<br><br></i></li>
<li>Your mount handles movement for you.<br><br> When your mount moves, you move along with it, which means that you're using your mount's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a>
 rating. Your mount, however, is actually doing the moving, and that 
leaves you free to do something else while your mount moves, such as 
making a ranged attack. You can't always act effectively while your 
mount moves, however. For example, if your mount moves more than 5 feet 
and you make a melee attack in the same <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a>, you can make only a single attack.<br><br></li>
<li>You continue to move with your mount until you fall off the mount or deliberately dismount.<br><br></li>
<li> You and your mount act on the same <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> count.<br><br>
 When you're riding a mount, roll initiative normally. When your turn 
comes in the initiative order, you and your mount act together. Riding 
an untrained mount in a battle can keep you from acting. If your mount 
is smart enough to act on its own, it might function as an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonplayercharacter')">NPC</a> and keep its own initiative number, which could prove inconvenient for you (see Intelligent Mounts in Part Five for details).<br><br></li>
<li>A mount can give you an advantage in melee.<br><br> If you're 
mounted and you make a melee attack against a foe that is on foot (that 
is, not mounted itself) and who is one or more size categories smaller 
than your mount, you get a +1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> on your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack roll</a>
 for being on higher ground. If the creature you attack is on higher 
ground than you and your mount, you don't get a bonus on your melee 
attack.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Moving While Mounted </b></p>
<p align="left"> When you and your mount move, the two of you use your 
mount's speed rating, adjusted for the mount's encumbrance and the 
terrain. Because your mount takes you along with it when it moves, a 
move for your mount also counts as a move for you. (See Rules of the 
Game, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">All About Movement</a>
 for notes on what constitutes movement.) Even though you're not 
propelling yourself, you still spend time moving. So, for example, if 
you and your mount move, neither you nor your mount can take a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_5footstep')">5-foot step</a> during the same turn.</p>
<p align="left">You can make Ride checks to affect your mount's movement, as noted in the Ride skill description and summarized below:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Leap:</b> You can get your mount to leap obstacles as
 part of its movement. Although it's not entirely clear from the Ride 
skill description, there are two elements to urging your mount to leap. 
First, you must use either your mount's Jump bonus (which includes an 
adjustment for the mount's speed rating; see the Jump skill description)
 or your Ride bonus (which does not include an adjustment for your 
mount's speed), whichever is lower, to determine how far or how high the
 mount can jump with you aboard.</p>
<p align="left">When using your mount's Jump bonus, you also must succeed on a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 15 Ride <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">check</a>.
 If you fail this check, you fall off the mount when it leaps. It's best
 to assume that you fall off wherever the mount begins the jump and that
 the mount does not attempt the jump if you fail to stay on.</p>
<p align="left">If you use your Ride bonus to determine the distance 
your mount jumps, handle the check exactly the same way you'd handle the
 check using the mount's own Jump bonus, but you still fall off (as 
noted above) if your check result isn't at least 15.</p>
<p align="left">Urging your mount to jump isn't an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a> for you, but it's part of your mount's movement. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Spurring Your Mount:</b><i></i>You can spur your mount to greater speed with a DC 15 Ride check. This is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moveaction')">move action</a>
 for you. If you succeed, your mount's speed increases by 10 feet for 1 
round. It's easiest to add the increase directly to your mount's current
 speed rating, whatever that happens to be. Normally, you add speed 
increases to a creature's base speed, then apply reductions for the 
creature's armor or load (see page 147 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Increasing your mount's speed damages the mount, as noted in the Ride skill description.</p>
<p align="left">If you fail the check to spur your mount, you still use a
 move action. Your mount doesn't get a speed increase, but it doesn't 
take any damage.</p>
<p align="left">In either case, the move action you use to spur your 
mount takes place along with your mount's movement and does not affect 
the actions your mount can use. For example, you can use a move action 
to spur your mount and your mount could still take a double move, or 
move and attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spurring and Leaping:</b> Because urging your mount 
to leap isn't an action for you, you can spur your mount to greater 
speed and urge it to leap during the same turn. You still use a move 
action to spur your mount. If you successfully spur your mount to 
greater speed (and it survives the resulting <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>),
 use the increased speed to determine your mount's Jump bonus; you still
 might wind up using your Ride bonus for the jump if it's lower than 
your mount's Jump bonus (see the section on leaping).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mounting or Dismounting: </b>It takes a move action 
from you to get on or off your mount. The act of mounting or dismounting
 doesn't count as movement for you (see Rules of the Game, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">All About Movement</a>;
 however, you must enter your mount's space to mount or exit the mount's
 space to dismount. You can enter or exit the mount's space as a 5-foot 
step (if the situation allows a 5-foot step) or as part of your normal 
movement. For example, if your speed is 30 and your mount is 30 feet 
away or less, you use one move action to reach the mount's space and a 
second move action to mount. If your mount has made more than a single 
move with you aboard this round, you don't have time left to dismount 
unless you use the Ride skill to make a fast dismount. Likewise, if you 
and your mount begin the round apart and the mount uses more than a 
single move to get into a position where you can mount, you don't have 
time left to do anything this round after mounting, but you could do 
something else while waiting for your mount to arrive.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Falling and Mounts </b></p>
<p align="left">If you and your mount <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_falling')">fall</a>
 down (as you might if the two of you step off a cliff or blunder into a
 pit), you and your mount take damage based on the distance you fall, as
 noted on page 303 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<p align="left">If you fall off your mount, or your mount drops from under you, you could avoid or reduce the damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Your Mount Falls:</b> If your mount trips or falls 
down for any reason, you must succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a 
soft fall and take no damage (you sort of use the mount as a shock 
absorber). If the check fails, you take 1d6 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_pointsofdamage')">points of damage</a>.
 This assumes your mount was moving or standing on the ground when it 
fell and that the mount is one size category bigger than you. Your DM 
might call for more damage if your mount is really big (see Part 5). If 
your mount was <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fly')">flying</a>
 when it falls, you fall from whatever altitude you and your mount had 
attained when the mount fell (your mount isn't that good a shock 
absorber).</p>
<p align="left"><b>You Fall:</b> If you fall off your mount (usually 
because of a failed Ride check) when the mount is moving along the 
ground, you take 1d6 points of damage when you hit the ground. If your 
mount was more than one size category bigger than you, you might take 
more damage (see Part Five). In either case, you can attempt a DC 15 
Ride check to soften the fall and take no damage (you use the mount as a
 brake).</p>
<p align="left">If your mount was flying when you fall, you take falling
 damage according to your altitude and take the appropriate falling 
damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>You Are Dropped:</b> If you are knocked <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_unconscious')">unconscious</a>
 while mounted, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (or 75% if 
you're in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of 
damage (or more if your mount is really big -- see Part Five). If you're
 riding bareback and you're unconscious, you automatically fall off.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That pretty well covers the basics of mounts and mounted
 movement. Next week, we'll consider what happens when you and your 
mount enter a battle.</p>
