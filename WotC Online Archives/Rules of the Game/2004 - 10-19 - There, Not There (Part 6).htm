<p align="left">A creature in gaseous form has a physical body of sorts,
 but that body is mostly immaterial. The game doesn't describe gaseous 
form in the same detail as incorporeality, but the two prove similar in 
many ways. Here are the basics of gaseous form:</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Immaterial</b></p>
<p align="left">Gaseous creatures have some mass and physical presence, 
but they are literally as light as air; as a rule of thumb, you can 
assume a creature's gaseous form weighs about a tenth as much as it did 
in solid form. Gaseous creatures have no material armor, and a solid 
creature that becomes gaseous loses all armor bonuses from armor worn, 
shields carried, and any natural armor bonuses. Dexterity, deflection 
bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply to the gaseous
 creature's Armor Class.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gaseous Defenses:</b> A creature in gaseous form has 
damage reduction 10/magic. This reflects the mutable and elastic nature 
of the creature's gaseous body.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't specifically mention it (except in the description for the <i>gaseous form</i> spell), but a gaseous creature isn't subject to critical hits.</p>
<p align="left">A gaseous creature does not need to breathe and it is 
immune to attacks involving breathing (troglodyte stench, poison gas, 
and the like).</p>
<p align="left">Spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities affect gaseous creatures normally.</p>
<p align="left">The rules say that winds or other forms of moving air 
affect gaseous creatures to the extent that the wind pushes them in the 
direction the wind is moving. However, even the strongest wind can't 
disperse or damage a creature in gaseous form. Presumably, this means 
that any wind effect will move a creature in gaseous form. Assume the 
creature moves 10 feet for each mile per hour of wind speed; apply this 
movement at the end of the gaseous creature's turn. This movement 
doesn't count against the gaseous creature's movement for the turn.</p>
<p align="left">A solid creature can't bull rush or overrun a creature 
in gaseous form (but it might be able to move into its space, see 
Abilities). A solid creature cannot trip a creature in gaseous form, and
 a gaseous creature cannot fall.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Limitations:</b> The rules don't say exactly what a 
gaseous creature can do, but they're pretty clear about what it cannot 
do. It cannot manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried 
along with its gaseous form (see Abilities).</p>
<p align="left">A gaseous creature cannot make any attacks (though a 
gaseous creature may have some special attack form), or cast spells with
 verbal, somatic, material, or focus components. If a solid creature has
 a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when 
the creature assumes gaseous form. A creature in gaseous form cannot 
speak, enter water, or run. When a creature assumes gaseous form, it 
loses supernatural abilities -- except for the supernatural ability to 
assume gaseous form and the ability to return to solid form.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Abilities: </b>So what can a gaseous creature do? It 
can move by flying. If no flying speed is listed for the creature, 
assume a flying speed of 10 feet and perfect maneuverability. It cannot 
pass through solid objects, but it can move through any opening that is 
not airtight, even a pinhole or crack. The rules don't say how quickly a
 gaseous creature can cram itself through a restricted area. I recommend
 that you allow a gaseous creature of any size to move through a space 
at least 6 inches square without squeezing or losing speed no matter 
what the creature's size category. Allow the creature to move through a 
space at least 1 inch square, but less than 6 inches square as hampered 
movement (double movement cost, see page 163 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>)
 and a space less than 1 inch square at a rate of 5 feet per action 
spent moving. I also recommend that a gaseous creature suffer no 
penalties for squeezing into a tight space.</p>
<p align="left">A gaseous creature of any size can move through other 
creatures' spaces just as incorporeal creatures can (see Part Four), 
though they cannot give or claim cover or concealment by hiding inside a
 creature or object. A gaseous creature provokes an attack of 
opportunity from a creature whose space it enters. A creature threatens 
its own space, so a gaseous creature also provokes an attack of 
opportunity when leaving that space. Likewise other creatures can enter a
 gaseous creature's space; most gaseous creatures cannot make any 
attacks, if so, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, even if another 
creature enters its space. If a gaseous creature has a deflection bonus 
to Armor Class, a creature entering its space must make a successful 
touch attack to enter the space; see Part Four for details.</p>
<p align="left">A gaseous creature has a Strength score, but it has no 
way to affect solid objects except by moving over them in a puff of air.
 To simulate that, try this. As a full-round action, a gaseous creature 
can attempt to create a wind effect in its own space. The wind speed is 
equal to the gaseous creature's Strength score plus the gaseous creature
 size modifier for grappling attacks: Colossal +16, Gargantuan +12, Huge
 +8, Large +4, Medium +0, Small -4, Tiny -8, Diminutive -12, Fine -16. 
Refer to Table 3-24 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> and to the text that accompanies it for wind effects.</p>
<p align="left">A gaseous creature cannot use a wind effect to handle 
material components for a spell or to complete somatic components for a 
spell. It can, however, use feats (namely Silent Spell, Still Spell, and
 Eschew Materials) to cast spells.</p>
<p align="left">When a creature becomes gaseous, everything it was 
holding or wearing becomes gaseous (and nearly weightless) along with 
it. The rules are unclear about exactly what happens to other creatures 
that you might hold or carry when you become gaseous. In general, you 
should assume that an ability to become gaseous extends only to the 
user. You can make a reasonable exception for creatures you carry tucked
 into your clothing (or that you pick up and tuck into your clothing), 
and that can include a familiar, cohort, or animal companion if the 
creature is small enough to fit into your clothing. Of course, if a 
familiar, cohort, or animal companion has the share spells ability and 
you (the master) cast the <i>gaseous form</i> spell on yourself, you can share that spell with the creature.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Translucent</b></p>
<p align="left">Discerning a creature in gaseous form from natural mist 
requires a DC 15 Spot check; distance between the spotter and the 
gaseous creature increases the DC as noted in the Spot skill 
description.</p>
<p align="left">A creature in gaseous form can attempt to hide in an area with mist and smoke, and it gains a +20 Hide bonus when doing so.</p>
