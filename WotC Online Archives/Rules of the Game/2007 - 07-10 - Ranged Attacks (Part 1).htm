<p align="LEFT">Players can experience an undeniable excitement when 
player characters come to grips with a foe in melee combat. Many regard 
the exchange of blows at close range as the ultimate test of a 
character's mettle. Sometimes, however, you may find it best to keep 
your foes at a distance, and sometimes a foe remains stubbornly out of 
melee reach.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fighting at range usually isn't too difficult; all you 
need is the right equipment and a clear field of fire. If your foe is 
rude enough to hide behind something solid, however, such as a rock, 
tree, or one of your allies, things can get complicated. This series 
examines ranged combat in general and looks at those times when fighting
 at a distance proves more difficult than just pointing and shooting.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Language of Ranged Attacks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Let's start off with a few terms that you'll encounter in this article.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ammunition: </b>Projectiles propelled from a device, 
such as a sling or bow. Ammunition often breaks when fired, so you can't
 count on reusing it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Concealment')">Concealment</a><b>:</b>
 Anything that keeps an attacker from clearly seeing the defender, such 
as fog, darkness, or a magical effect. Concealment doesn't improve a 
defender's Armor Class, but it can make an attack miss.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Cover')">Cover</a><b>:</b>
 A barrier between an attacker and defender. The barrier could be an 
object, creature, or magical effect. A defender behind cover gains a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Iterative Attack:</b> One or more extra attacks a character gains when using the full attack action by virtue of a high <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack bonus</a>; see pages 22 and 143 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 22 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> On an attack roll, apply the 
bonus from the appropriate column on Table 3-1 according to the class to
 which the character belongs. Whether a character uses the first (good) 
base attack bonus, the second (average) base attack bonus, or the third 
(poor) base attack bonus depends on his or her class. Barbarians, 
fighters, paladins, and rangers have a good base attack bonus, so they 
use the first Base Attack Bonus column. Clerics, druids, monks, and 
rogues have an average base attack bonus, so they use the second column.
 Sorcerers and wizards have a poor base attack bonus, so they use the 
third column. Numbers after a slash indicate additional attacks at 
reduced bonuses: "+12/+7/+2" means three attacks per round, with an 
attack bonus of +12 for the first attack, +7 for the second, and +2 for 
the third. Any modifiers on attack rolls apply to all these attacks 
normally, but bonuses do not grant extra attacks. For example, when 
Lidda the halfling rogue is 2nd level, she has a base attack bonus of 
+1. With a thrown weapon, she adds her Dexterity bonus (+3), her size 
bonus (+1), and a racial bonus (+1) for a total of +6. Even though a +6 
base attack bonus would grant an additional attack at +1, raising that 
number to +6 via ability, racial, size, weapon, or other bonuses doesn't
 grant Lidda an additional attack. If a character has more than one 
class (see Multiclass Characters, page 59), the base attack bonuses for 
each class are cumulative.</p>

<p align="LEFT">If you get more than one attack per round because your 
base attack bonus is high enough, because you fight with two weapons or a
 double weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting under Special Attacks, page 
160), or for some special reason (such as a feat or a magic item), you 
must use a full-round action to get your additional attacks. You do not

 5-foot step. You may take the step before, after, or between your 
attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you get multiple attacks because your base attack 
bonus is high enough, you must make the attacks in order from highest 
bonus to lowest. If you are using two weapons, you can strike with

 A straight, unblocked line between two locations on the battlefield. To
 aim a ranged attack at a target, you must have line of effect to that 
target.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In general, it takes a solid object to block line of effect. Magical effects that function just like solid objects, such as <i>walls of force,</i> also block line of effect.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Ranged Attack Basics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A full understanding of ranged attacks requires quite a 
tour through the rulebooks. The first stop is the attack entry on pages 
139-140 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> Other essential stops include 
the discussion of ranged weapons on page 112, the range increment entry 
on page 114, the weapon descriptions on pages 114-122, the discussion of
 range penalties on page 134, and the sections on cover and concealment 
starting on page 150.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Selected excerpts from pages 139-140 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ranged Attacks:</b> With a ranged weapon, you can 
shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon's maximum range 
and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown weapon is five 
range increments. For projectile weapons, it is ten range increments. 
Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in their 
descriptions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Multiple Attacks:</b> A character who can make more 
than one attack per round must use the full attack action (see 
Full-Round Actions, below) in order to get more than one attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shooting or Throwing into a Melee:</b> If you shoot 
or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly 
character, you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you have to
 aim carefully to avoid hitting your friend. Two characters are engaged 
in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the 
other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not 
considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">If your target (or the part of your target you're aiming
 at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest 
friendly character, you can avoid the -4 penalty, even if the creature 
you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Precise Shot: </i>If you have the Precise Shot feat (page 98), you don't take this penalty.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Selected excerpts from pages 112-114 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Melee and Ranged Weapons:</b> Melee weapons are used 
for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. 
Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not 
effective in melee.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Thrown Weapons: </i>Daggers, clubs, shortspears, 
spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, 
shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his or her 
Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash 
weapons, such as a vial of acid; see Throw Splash Weapon, page 158). It 
is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is,
 a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range Increment
 column on Table 7-5), but a character who does so takes a -4 penalty on
 the attack roll. Throwing a light or onehanded weapon is a standard 
action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. 
Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat (a 
possible critical hit) only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double 
damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 
feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Projectile Weapons: </i>Light crossbows, slings, 
heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite 
longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile 
weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific 
weapon descriptions later in this chapter). A character gets no Strength
 bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a specially 
built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow, or sling. 
If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage 
rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Ammunition: </i>Projectile weapons use ammunition: 
arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings).
 When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; 
crossbows and slings require an action for reloading. Generally 
speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered 
useless, while normal ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being 
destroyed or lost.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated 
as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or 
otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons, below), and 
what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Range Increment:</b> Any attack at less than this 
distance is not penalized for range, so an arrow from a shortbow (range 
increment 60 feet) can strike at an enemy 59 feet away or closer with no
 penalty. However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 
penalty on the attack roll. A shortbow archer firing at a target 200 
feet away takes a -6 penalty on the attack roll (-2 x 3, because 200 
feet is at least three range increments but not four). A thrown weapon, 
such as a throwing axe, has a maximum range of five range increments. A 
projectile weapon, such as a bow, can shoot out to ten range increments.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Selected excerpts from page 134 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Range Penalty:</b> The range penalty for a ranged 
weapon depends on the weapon and the distance to the target. All ranged 
weapons have a range increment, such as 10 feet for a thrown dart or 100
 feet for a longbow (see Table 7-5: Weapons, page 116). Any attack from a
 distance of less than one range increment is not penalized for range, 
so an arrow from a shortbow (range increment 60 feet) can strike at 
enemies up to 59 feet away with no penalty. However, each full range 
increment causes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll. A shortbow 
archer firing at a target 200 feet away takes a -6 penalty on his attack
 roll (because 200 feet is at least three range increments but not four 
increments).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thrown weapons, such as throwing axes, have a maximum 
range of five range increments. Projectile weapons, such as bows, can 
shoot up to ten increments.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Selected excerpts from pages 150-152 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>COVER</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One of the best defenses available is cover. By taking 
cover behind a tree, a wall, the side of a wagon, or the battlements of a
 castle, you can protect yourself from attacks, especially ranged 
attacks, and also from being spotted. To determine whether your target 
has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If 
any line from this corner to any corner of the target's square passes 
through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover,
 or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to
 AC).</p>
<p align="LEFT">When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, 
your target has cover if any line from your square to the target's 
square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee 
attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you (such as with a reach
 weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>CONCEALMENT</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Besides cover, another way to avoid attacks is to make 
it hard for opponents to know where you are. Concealment encompasses all
 circumstances where nothing physically blocks a blow or shot but where 
something interferes with an attacker's accuracy. Concealment gives the 
subject of a successful attack a chance that the attacker missed because
 of the concealment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Typically, concealment is provided by fog, smoke, a 
shadowy area, darkness, tall grass, foliage, or magical effects that 
make it difficult to pinpoint a target's location.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To determine whether your target has concealment from 
your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from 
this corner to any corner of the target's square passes through a square
 or border that provides concealment, the target has concealment. When 
making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has 
concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that grants 
concealment (such as a cloud of smoke). When making a melee attack 
against a target that isn't adjacent to you (for instance, with a reach 
weapon), use the rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition, some magical effects (such as the <i>blur </i>and <i>displacement </i>spells) provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Concealment Miss Chance:</b> Concealment gives the 
subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed 
because of the concealment. If the attacker hits, the defender must make
 a miss chance percentile roll to avoid being struck. (To expedite play,
 make both rolls at the same time.) Multiple concealment conditions 
(such as a defender in a fog and under the effect of a <i>blur </i>spell) do not stack.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Here's a summary, along with a few additional notes.</p>
<ul>
<li> You make a ranged attack with a projectile or thrown weapon.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">To determine if a weapon is suitable for ranged attacks, check the weapon's description and Table 7-5 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 (or the equivalent in the rulebook where you found the weapon). Most 
ranged weapons are clearly labeled as such. Melee weapons suitable for 
throwing have range increments in their entries.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You need the proper ammunition when firing a projectile 
weapon. For example, you can't fire a crossbow bolt from a bow or an 
arrow from a crossbow.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you want to throw something that's not a ranged 
weapon, you might have to use it as an improvised weapon; see page 113 
in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and also see Part Two.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 113 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improvised Weapons:</b> Sometimes objects not crafted
 to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat -- people fight with 
anything from broken bottles to chair legs to thrown mugs. Because such 
objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses one in 
combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a -4 penalty 
on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category 
and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, the DM should compare 
its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a 
reasonable match. For instance, a table leg is similar to a club, while a
 broken bottle is similar to a dagger. An improvised weapon scores a 
threat (a possible critical hit) on a natural roll of 20 and deals 
double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range
 increment of 10 feet.</p>
</td>

<ul>
<li> Every ranged weapon has a range increment.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">A ranged weapon's range increment is shown on Table 7-5 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> (or the equivalent in the rulebook where you found the weapon).</p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted earlier, a range increment is a both a fraction
 of the maximum distance a ranged weapon can shoot and a measure of the 
accuracy the shot looses over that distance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A projectile weapon can fire a distance equal to 10 
range increments. For example, a shortbow, with a range increment of 60 
feet, can fire a maximum of 600 feet. A thrown weapon can reach a 
maximum distance of five range increments. A dagger, with a range 
increment of 10 feet, can be thrown a maximum of 50 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For every full range increment of distance between you and your target, you take a cumulative -2 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalty</a>
 on the attack roll. For example, if you fire a shortbow at a target 50 
feet away, you have no attack penalty from range (because the distance 
is less than a full range increment). If the target is exactly 60 feet 
away, your attack penalty for range would be -2 (for one range 
increment). A target 90 feet away would still have an attack penalty for
 range of -2 (one full range increment, but not two). A target 600 feet 
away would have an attack penalty of -20 (for 10 full range increments).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some ranged weapons have different maximum ranges than 
the general rule specifies. If so, the weapon's description will note 
the exception.</p>
<ul>
<li> Ranged attacks provoke <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackofopportunity')">attacks of opportunity</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">You drop your guard when you prepare for your shot and 
take aim. This provokes attacks of opportunity from every foe who 
threatens you at the time you make your ranged attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can avoid the attack of opportunity in several ways, such as taking a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_5footstep')">5-foot step</a> to leave the threatened space or standing behind cover when you shoot (see page 151 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<ul>
<li> Dexterity governs ranged attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> Your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> bonus (or penalty) applies to your attack roll when you make a ranged attack. Your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a>
 bonus might or might not apply to the damage you deal with a successful
 ranged attack. Your Strength bonus (or penalty) applies to the damage 
you deal with most thrown weapons and to some projectile weapons (such 
as slings and composite bows), as noted in the weapon's description. See
 Part Two for details.</p>
<ul>
<li> It's difficult to fire into a melee.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">When your target is engaged in melee with one or more of
 your allies, you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you must
 be careful where you shoot. The Precise Shot feat allows you to ignore 
this penalty, and you can get around it in other ways; see Part Four. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The penalty you take for firing into a melee stacks with
 any other penalties that apply to the shot, such as range or the 
target's cover. See <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040120a">Rules of the Game: Does It Stack?</a></i> for more on stacking penalties.</p>
<ul>
<li> Cover often affects ranged attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Because you often have a great deal of distance between 
you and the target you've chosen for your ranged attack, cover 
frequently intervenes. Usually, a target with cover gains a +4 bonus to 
its Armor Class when it has cover. See Part Four for details.</p>
<ul>
<li> A variety of things qualify as ranged attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The rules for ranged attacks, including feats that 
affect ranged attacks, can apply to many spells and other effects; see 
Part Four for details.</p>
