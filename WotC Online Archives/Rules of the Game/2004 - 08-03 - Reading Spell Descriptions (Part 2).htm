<p align="left">Fortunately for the harried DM and the eager player, 
spell descriptions are arranged to provide lots of useful information 
quickly.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Anatomy of a Spell Description</b></p>
<p align="left">A basic spell description comes in two parts. The first 
part is a single column of information roughly 10 lines long (sometimes a
 little more, sometimes a lot less) that begins with the spell's name. 
This is what we'll call the "header" in this article. The header is 
packed with information about the spell, provided that you know how to 
read it. It's helpful to think of a spell's header as its game 
statistics, much like the statistics block at the beginning of a 
monster's entry.</p>
<p align="left">The second part of a spell description consists of one 
or more paragraphs of text that explain what the spell is all about and 
also adds certain details that aren't fully explained in the header.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Spell Header</b></p>
<p align="left">The header contains most of the vital statistics for the
 spell. The information presented in the header is the foundation of the
 spell, and it takes precedence over anything you find in the 
explanatory text below it. If you find (or think you've found) something
 in the text that contradicts the header, use the information in the 
header.</p>
<p align="left">All spell headers are arranged in the same general 
manner, and the elements in a spell header are explained in great detail
 in Chapter 10 in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> pages172-177. That's a great deal of material, so here's an overview, line by line.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Name</b></p>
<p align="left">This first entry in the header shows the name by which 
the spell is generally known. You may encounter the spell under a 
different name, but this is rare unless your DM has decided to rename 
spells to add some flavor to the campaign.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell School</b></p>
<p align="left">Magic in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game is divided into eight schools of magic, and the second entry in the header shows the school. Pages 172-174 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 discuss spell schools. A spell's school usually doesn't affect play 
much, though if you encounter a magical effect when it's operating, you 
can use a <i>detect magic</i> effect (and a Spellcraft skill check) to 
determine the school of magic involved. That, in turn, may allow you to 
surmise what the magic is doing, at least in broad terms. The Spell 
Focus feat also depends on a spell school, as does the wizard's school 
specialization option.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Subschool: </b>Sometimes a second entry in a spell 
header contains a parenthetical entry that shows a spell's subschool. A 
subschool represents a portion of the school that works in a certain 
way. A spell's subschool often indicates how the spell functions in 
play, so it's worth paying attention to a subschool entry when you see 
it. Referring to the notes on subschools on pages 172-174 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 often can settle questions about how a spell works. Here's a quick 
overview of schools and subschools. This overview covers only the 
highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li> Abjuration: Protective spells that block or banish things or that negate other magic. This school has no subschools.<br><br></li>
<li>Conjuration: Spells that bring other things into being, move things around, or provide healing.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As a general rule, when you conjure something, you 
cannot make it appear in thin air or inside another object or creature. 
This means you cannot aim the spell so that what you conjure falls and 
crushes or damages what's below it.</p>
<p align="left">This school has five subschools:</p>
<p align="left"><i>Calling: </i>These spells bring creatures from some 
place in the campaign to the caster or to the place where the caster 
aims the spell. By definition, a calling spell has an instantaneous 
duration, and that means it cannot be dispelled (though some abjurations
 might banish the called creature back where it came). In general, any 
effects that a called creature produces remain behind and function for 
their usual duration even after the spell ends or the called creature 
leaves, or both. A calling is a two-way trip; the creature called has a 
one-time ability to return from whence it came.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Creation:</i> These spells make things on the spot. Only creation spells with durations longer than instantaneous can be dispelled.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Healing:</i> These spells restore lost hit points to the living or cure other afflictions.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Summoning</i>: Summonings are similar to calling 
spells. A summoning can bring either creatures or objects, depending on 
the spell. Unlike a calling, a summoning usually has a short duration 
and can be dispelled. A summoned creature cannot use any summoning 
abilities of its own while the summoning lasts, and it cannot use any 
spell that has an XP component. It also cannot use any spell-like 
ability that would have an XP component if it were a spell. When a 
summoning spell ends (because the spell's duration expires, because the 
creature is killed, or because the spell has been dispelled), any 
magical effects that a summoned creature has produced immediately 
expire. Like a calling, a summoning is a two-way trip for a creature.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Teleportation:</i> These spells send the caster or a 
subject the caster designates from the caster's location (or place where
 the caster aims the spell) to some other place of the caster's 
choosing. The trip usually is one-way and it's instantaneous, so it 
cannot be dispelled. A teleportation spell involves travel trough the 
Astral Plane. If access to the Astral Plane is blocked, teleportation 
spells don't work.</p>
<ul>
<li> Divination: Spells that provide some kind of information. 
Divination has one subschool (but not all divinations are part of that 
subschool).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><i>Scrying:</i> A scrying spell places a magical sensor 
in some location of the caster's choosing. Although the descriptive text
 for this subschool doesn't mention it, you usually do not need line of 
effect to a location to aim a sensor or to receive information from it 
after you cast the spell.</p>
<p align="left">The sensor from a scrying spell usually has the same 
sensory capabilities that the caster has, though the spell's description
 may limit those; for example, the <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance </i>spell
 allows either sight or hearing (caster's choice). When a scrying spell 
allows the use of a particular sense, the sensor has at least as much 
sensory ability as the caster has. If the caster has an ability such as 
darkvision (whether from a special quality or a spell), the sensor has 
it, too. Effects that emanate from the caster (such as the <i>detect magic</i>
 spell) don't extend through the sensor, however. The sensor also acts 
as a separate sensory organ for the caster, and the spell works as 
described even when the caster has some impairment such as blindness or 
deafness; for example, if you're blinded, you can still "see" with a <i>clairaudience/clairvoyance </i>spell.
 In such cases, the spell's sensory ability is equal to the human norm 
unless the spell's descriptive text specifies a greater ability.</p>
<ul>
<li> Enchantment: Fantasy literature often uses the term "enchantment" as a catchall for any magical effect. In the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, however, enchantment spells affect the mind, and spells from this
 school always have the mind-affecting descriptor (see below). Objects, 
constructs, undead, plants, and mindless creatures in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game can never be enchanted, either because they have no minds to 
affect or because they are immune to mind-affecting things. The 
enchantment school has two subschools.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><i>Charm: </i>These spells make their recipients think 
well of the caster. A charm makes a subject friendly, but it doesn't 
allow the caster to control the subject like a marionette.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Compulsion:</i> These spells force the subject to 
take a certain action or act in a certain general way. Many compulsions 
specify the kind of action the subject must take. The <i>animal trance</i>
 spell, for example, makes animals and magical beasts do nothing but 
watch the caster. Other compulsions allow the caster to specify some 
action or activity, but nothing more (<i>suggestion</i>, for example). The most powerful compulsions turn the subject into an automaton, or nearly so (the various <i>dominate</i> spells, for example).</p>
<ul>
<li>Evocation: Spells that manipulate energy (or sometimes matter) usually to produce a destructive effect. There are no subschools.<br><br></li>
<li>Illusion: Spells that deceive the senses or the mind. There are five subschools.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><i>Figment: </i>Spells that create false sensations. A 
figment cannot make something seem to be something else. Most figments 
cannot duplicate intelligible speech; when they can the spell 
description will specifically say so.</p>
<p align="left">A figment is unreal and cannot produce real effects; it 
can't deal damage, support weight, provide nutrition, or act as a 
barrier (except to sight if the figment is visible, as most are). If you
 create the image of a creature with a figment spell, you usually can 
make it move around, but only within the spell's area, which usually 
isn't mobile.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Glamer:</i> Spells that make the recipient look, 
feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to 
disappear. Beware of attempts to use figments as glamers and vice versa.
 For example, you can use a figment to create an apple tree, but you 
can't use a figment to make your buddy look like an apple tree.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Pattern:</i> A visible magical image, something like a
 figment, except that the image has some affect on viewers' minds. All 
patterns have the mind-affecting descriptor. Patterns have no effects on
 creatures that cannot see.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Phantasm:</i> Spells that create mental images. 
Usually, only the caster and the spell's recipient (or recipients) can 
perceive the image. All phantasms have the mind-affecting descriptor.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Shadow:</i> A spell that creates something that is 
partially real, but made mostly from extradimensional energies the 
caster brings together with the spell. Shadows are similar to figments, 
but they can have real effects because they're partially real 
themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li> Necromancy: Spells that involve life force, unlife, or death. There are no subschools.<br><br></li>
<li> Transmutation: Spells that change the properties of some creature, 
thing, or condition fall into the school of transmutation. There are no 
subschools.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Descriptors</b></p>
<p align="left">Sometimes a second entry in a spell header contains 
information enclosed in brackets. This is the spell's descriptor. Some 
spells have no descriptors, and some spells have several.</p>
<p align="left">A descriptor is something like a subschool, except that 
spells from different schools can have the same descriptor or 
descriptors. A spell's descriptor can have a big impact on play, but 
only because the descriptor helps determine how the spell interacts with
 other spells or with a creature's special abilities. You won't find a 
long list of definitions for descriptors in the game because they don't 
have much meaning by themselves. Here's a brief overview, however:</p>
<ul>
<li> Acid: Acid is a type of energy in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, and most
 spells with this descriptor deal acid damage. As you'd expect, acid 
immunity makes the spell's recipient immune to acid damage from the 
spell. Acid resistance reduces acid damage from the spell. <br><br></li>
<li>Air: Air is one of the four basic elements in the <b>D&amp;D</b> 
game. Air spells usually move air around or allow some kind of movement 
through the air. The air descriptor doesn't have much impact on play; 
creatures of the air subtype, for example, don't have immunity to air 
spells (though that wouldn't be a bad house rule). If your party goes 
plane hopping, you might find yourself in a place where air spells are 
somehow enhanced or diminished, however.<br><br></li>
<li>Chaotic: Chaos is one of the four basic alignments in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Chaotic spells are usually less effective (or ineffective) 
against creatures with chaotic alignments or with the chaos subtype. 
They usually have enhanced effects against creatures with lawful 
alignments or with the lawful subtype. If your party goes plane hopping,
 you might find yourself in a place where chaos spells are somehow 
enhanced or diminished.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Sometimes a spell may have the chaotic descriptor and 
other times it may not. Many summoning spells, for example, gain the 
chaotic descriptor if they're used to summon chaotic creatures.</p>
<p align="left">A cleric cannot cast a spell with the chaotic descriptor
 if the cleric's alignment is lawful or if the cleric is dedicated to a 
lawful deity.</p>
<ul>
<li> Cold: Cold is a type of energy in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, and most
 spells with this descriptor deal cold damage. As you'd expect, cold 
immunity makes the spell's recipient immune to cold damage from the 
spell. Cold resistance reduces cold damage from the spell. Creatures 
with vulnerability to cold take 50% more cold damage than normal.<br><br></li>
<li>Darkness: These spells create areas of dim light that conceal things
 within the areas they cover. In general, darkness spells negate the 
effects of light spells of equal or lower level and vice versa.<br><br></li>
<li> Death: Spells that produce instant death in living targets. Targets
 that aren't alive, such as undead and constructs, can't be affected by 
death spells. Spells such as <i>death ward</i> provide protection against death spells.<br><br></li>
<li> Earth: Earth is one of the four basic elements in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Earth spells usually move or manipulate dirt, stone and similar 
materials, or allow some kind of movement through the earth. The earth 
descriptor doesn't have much impact on play; creatures with the earth 
subtype, for example, don't have immunity to earth spells (though that 
wouldn't be a bad house rule). If your party goes plane hopping, you 
might find yourself in a place where earth spells are somehow enhanced 
or diminished, however.<br><br></li>
<li>Electricity: Electricity is a type of energy in the <b>D&amp;D</b> 
game, and most spells with this descriptor deal electricity damage. As 
you'd expect, electricity immunity makes the spell's recipient immune to
 electricity damage from the spell. Electricity resistance reduces 
electricity damage from the spell.<br><br></li>
<li>Evil: Evil is one of the four basic alignments in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Evil spells are usually less effective (or ineffective) against 
creatures with evil alignments or with the evil subtype. They usually 
have enhanced effects against creatures with good alignments or with the
 good subtype. If your party goes plane hopping, you might find yourself
 in a place where evil spells are somehow enhanced or diminished.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Sometimes a spell may have the evil descriptor and other
 times it may not. Many summoning spells, for example, gain the evil 
descriptor if they're used to summon evil creatures.</p>
<p align="left">A cleric cannot cast a spell with the evil descriptor if
 the cleric's alignment is good or if the cleric is dedicated to a good 
deity.</p>
<ul>
<li> Fear: These spells usually impose one of several conditions of fear
 on the recipient: shaken, frightened, or panicked. All spells with the 
fear descriptor also have the mind-affecting descriptor.<br><br></li>
<li> Fire: Fire is a type of energy in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, and it 
also is one of the four basic elements as well. Most spells with this 
descriptor deal fire damage. As you'd expect, fire immunity makes the 
spell's recipient immune to fire damage from the spell. Fire resistance 
reduces fire damage from the spell. Creatures with vulnerability to fire
 take 50% more fire damage than normal. If your party goes plane 
hopping, you might find yourself in a place where fire spells are 
somehow enhanced or diminished.<br><br></li>
<li>Force: These spells produce or manipulate a kind of magical force 
whose exact nature isn't detailed anywhere in the rules. Force effects 
that deal damage can harm incorporeal creatures without the usual miss 
chance. Force spells cast on the Material Plane can be aimed at, and can
 harm, creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Force barriers block 
incorporeal, astral, and ethereal creatures.<br><br></li>
<li>Good: Good is one of the four basic alignments in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Good spells are usually less effective (or ineffective) against 
creatures with good alignments or with the good subtype. They usually 
have enhanced effects against creatures with evil alignments or with the
 evil subtype. If your party goes plane hopping, you might find yourself
 in a place where good spells are somehow enhanced or diminished.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Sometimes a spell may have the good descriptor and other
 times it may not. Many summoning spells, for example, gain the good 
descriptor if they're used to summon good creatures.</p>
<p align="left">A cleric cannot cast a spell with the good descriptor if
 the cleric's alignment is evil or if the cleric is dedicated to an evil
 deity.</p>
<ul>
<li> Language-Dependent: These spells don't function unless the caster 
speaks to the recipient in a language that the recipient understands. 
You can use some magical means, such as the <i>tongues</i> spell, to provide the necessary means of communication.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Anything that keeps the recipient from comprehending the caster's speech foils the spell, such as a <i>silence </i>spell or the recipient's deafness. Casters can use some means of nonverbal "speech" (such as a <i>helm of telepathy</i>) to overcome silence or deafness.</p>
<p align="left">Many language-dependent spells also are mind-affecting spells.</p>
<ul>
<li> Lawful: Lawful is one of the four basic alignments in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Lawful spells are usually less effective (or ineffective) against
 creatures with lawful alignments or with the lawful subtype. They 
usually have enhanced effects against creatures with chaotic alignments 
or with the chaotic subtype. If your party goes plane hopping, you might
 find yourself in a place where lawful spells are somehow enhanced or 
diminished.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Sometimes a spell may have the lawful descriptor and 
other times it may not. Many summoning spells, for example, gain the 
lawful descriptor if they're used to summon lawful creatures.</p>
<p align="left">A cleric cannot cast a spell with the lawful descriptor 
if the cleric's alignment is chaotic or if the cleric is dedicated to a 
chaotic deity.</p>
<ul>
<li> Light: These spells create illumination. In general, light spells 
negate the effects of darkness spells of equal or lower level and vice 
versa.<br><br></li>
<li>Mind-Affecting: These spells shape or interfere with the subject's 
thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. In the latter case, the subject's 
senses aren't affected, but the subject's mental responses to her senses
 are changed. <br><br></li>
<li> Sonic: Sonic is a type of energy in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, and 
most spells with this descriptor deal sonic damage. As you'd expect, 
sonic immunity makes the spell's recipient immune to sonic damage from 
the spell. Sonic resistance reduces sonic damage from the spell.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> The <i>silence</i> spell description says that the spell provides protection against sonic effects. For all practical purposes, this means that a <i>silence</i> spell blocks line of effect for a sonic spell. The sonic spell's area cannot extend into the area that a <i>silence</i> spell's emanation fills, and neither can a sonic spell be cast through a <i>silence</i> spell's emanation to affect something on the other side.</p>
<ul>
<li> Water: Water is one of the four basic elements in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. Water spells usually move or manipulate liquid water, ice or 
similar materials, or allow some kind of movement through the water. The
 water descriptor doesn't have much impact on play; creatures of the 
water subtype, for example, don't have immunity to water spells (though 
that wouldn't be a bad house rule). If your party goes plane hopping, 
you might find yourself in a place where water spells are somehow 
enhanced or diminished, however.</li>
