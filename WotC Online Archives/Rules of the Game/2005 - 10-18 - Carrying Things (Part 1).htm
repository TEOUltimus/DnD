<p align="left">Sooner or later, every character has to worry about 
carrying a hefty amount of weight. Piles of treasure represent a 
pleasant burden, but characters might also have to haul unconscious, 
dead, or petrified comrades out of dungeons, tote piles of loose debris 
to clear out a collapsed tunnel, or lug jugs of water and bags of 
supplies through a wasteland to avoid dying of hunger and thirst. This 
series examines several aspects of the mundane, but all too necessary, 
job of carrying things around.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Carrying Capacity</b></p>
<p align="left"><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">Creatures</a> that lack <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a>
 scores can't carry much of anything because they have no way to exert 
force on other creatures or objects. Other creatures have a carrying 
capacity based on their <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">sizes</a> and Strength scores. The bigger and stronger a creature is, the more it can carry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Why a Size Adjustment?</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2010-18%20-%20Carrying%20Things%20%28Part%201%29_files/rulesgame_sizes.jpg" align="right" border="0">According to the <i>Player's Handbook,</i>
 a Strength score measures a creature's muscle and physical power. So, 
why should two different creatures with the same Strength score have 
different carrying capacities? The answer is fairly complex, but it 
boils down to this: Some body arrangements are better suited to use 
their Strength than others in some situations, and less able to use 
their Strength than others in other situations. Here's an example: A 
typical draft horse (a heavy horse) found on a farm and a fairly 
low-level human <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fighter')">fighter</a>
 have similar Strength scores (around 16). The horse, however, can carry
 three times what the human can because of its sheer size (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Large')">Large</a>),
 and because it's a quadruped. Size helps the horse carry more simply 
because its greater mass allows it to handle more weight (just as a 
bridge can support more weight than a footstool). Likewise, the horse's 
four motive limbs keep it more stable than the two-legged human when 
carrying a load, and give it more ability to exert a pulling force when 
carrying a load on its back or when dragging something.</p>
<p align="left">So, why not just give the horse a higher Strength score?
 Well, because a creature's Strength score also helps with melee combat.
 A draft horse is a fine animal for doing heavy work, but it's not 
really designed for fighting. It can carry or drag a great deal, and its
 hooves can prove deadly, but not so much more dangerous than the 
fighter's sword. If we used the same scale to calculate the carrying 
capacity for both horse and human, the horse's Strength score would have
 to be somewhere around 24. The horse's Strength modifier for melee 
attacks and damage would be +7 instead of +3, and it would be quite a 
melee machine. By limiting the horse's Strength score and keeping it in 
line with what the human fighter has, while also increasing its carrying
 capacity, the rules more accurately represent what each creature can do
 in the game world.</p>
<p align="left">The forgoing is only one example of how the rules handle
 size. Many kinds of special combat, such as grappling and tripping, 
also include a size modifier to reflect the inherent advantages (or 
disadvantages) of being bigger than your foe.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Load and Encumbrance</b></p>
<p align="left">A creature slows down as its load increases. Pages 161-162 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and <i>Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">All About Movement</a></i> discuss loads and encumbrance in detail, but here are the highlights.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the pages 161-162 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>CARRYING CAPACITY</b></p>
<p align="left">Encumbrance rules determine how much a character's armor
 and equipment slow him or her down. Encumbrance comes in two parts: 
encumbrance by armor and encumbrance by total weight.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Encumbrance by Armor:</b> A character's armor (as 
described on Table 7-6: Armor and Shields, page 123) defines his or her 
maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, armor check penalty, speed, and running 
speed. Unless your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, that's 
all you need to know. The extra gear your character carries, such as 
weapons and rope, won't slow him or her down any more than the armor 
already does.</p>
<p align="left">If your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, 
however, then you'll need to calculate encumbrance by weight. Doing so 
is most important when your character is trying to carry some heavy 
object, such as a treasure chest.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weight:</b> If you want to determine whether your 
character's gear is heavy enough to slow him or her down more than the 
armor already does, total the weight of all the character's items, 
including armor, weapons, and gear. Compare this total to the 
character's Strength on Table 9-1: Carrying Capacity. Depending on how 
the weight compares to the character's carrying capacity, he or she may 
be carrying a light, medium, or heavy load. Like armor, a character's 
load affects his or her maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, carries a check 
penalty (which works like an armor check penalty), reduces the 
character's speed, and affects how fast the character can run, as shown 
on Table 9-2: Carrying Loads. A medium or heavy load counts as medium or
 heavy armor for the purpose of abilities or skills that are restricted 
by armor. Carrying a light load does not encumber a character.</p>
<p align="left">If your character is wearing armor, use the worse figure
 (from armor or from load) for each category. Do not stack the 
penalties. </p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="left"><b>Lifting and Dragging:</b> A character can lift as much as his or her maximum load over his or her head.</p>
<p align="left">A character can lift as much as double his or her 
maximum load off the ground, but he or she can only stagger around with 
it. While overloaded in this way, the character loses any Dexterity 
bonus to AC and can move only 5 feet per round (as a full-round action).</p>
<p align="left">A character can generally push or drag along the ground 
as much as five times his or her maximum load. Favorable conditions 
(such as being on smooth ground or dragging a slick object) can double 
these numbers, and bad circumstances (such as being on broken ground or 
pushing an object that snags) can reduce them to one-half or less.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bigger and Smaller Creatures:</b> The figures on 
Table 9-1: Carrying Capacity are for Medium bipedal creatures. A larger 
bipedal creature can carry more weight depending on its size category, 
as follows: Large x2, Huge x4, Gargantuan x8, Colossal x16. A smaller 
creature can carry less weight depending on its size category, as 
follows: Small x3/4, Tiny x1/2, Diminutive x1/4, Fine x1/8. Thus, a 
human with a Strength score magically boosted to equal that of a giant 
would still have a harder time lifting, say, a horse or a boulder than a
 giant would.</p>
<hr size="1">
<p align="left"><b>Tremendous Strength:</b> For Strength scores not 
shown on Table 9-1, find the Strength score between 20 and 29 that has 
the same number in the "ones" digit as the creature's Strength score 
does. Multiply the figures by 4 if the creature's Strength is in the 
30s, 16 if it's in the 40s, 64 if it's in the 50s, and so on. For 
example, a cloud giant with a 35 Strength can carry four times what a 
creature with a 25 Strength can carry, or 3,200 pounds x 4 because the 
cloud giant is Huge, for a total of 12,800 pounds. </p>

<ul>
<li>Table 9-1 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> shows carrying capacity and loads for <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a>
 humanoid creatures. The first column shows light loads for various 
Strength scores. A creature carrying a light load isn't slowed down by 
the load it carries.<br><br></li>
<li> The second column in the table shows medium loads. A creature 
carrying a medium load suffers a speed reduction as shown on Table 9-2 
in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> For creatures with speeds not shown on Table 9-2, see page 20 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">A creature carrying a medium load also has a limit on the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> bonus it can apply to its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a> and a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalty</a> on Dexterity checks, also as shown on Table 9-2.</p>
<p align="left">A creature that has a fly speed from wings or similar appendages cannot fly when carrying a medium load.</p>
<ul>
<li> The third column in the table shows heavy loads. The highest number
 in this column also is the maximum weight the creature can lift over 
its head (assuming that the creature has limbs that allow it to perform 
such an act).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">A creature carrying a heavy load also has a limit on the
 Dexterity bonus it can apply to its Armor Class and a penalty on 
Dexterity checks, also as shown on Table 9-2. In addition, a heavy load 
limits a creature's running <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a>, also as shown on Table 9-2.</p>
<p align="left">A heavy load prevents some kinds of flight just as a medium load does.</p>
<ul>
<li> A creature wearing armor uses the maximum Dexterity bonus, 
Dexterity check penalty, speed reduction, and reduction in running speed
 as shown on the armor on Table 7-6 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> or 
the values shown for its load on Table 9-2, whichever is worse. For 
example, a human with a Strength score of 18, wearing full plate armor, 
and carrying a total of 100 pounds of gear and loot (including the 
armor) is carrying only a light load. The full plate armor, however, 
impedes the character, reducing the human's speed to 20 feet, imposing a
 maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +1 and imposing a Dexterity 
check penalty of -6. The character also moves at only three times speed 
when running.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">A speed reduction from armor also prevents flying. A 
creature that has a fly speed from wings or similar appendages cannot 
fly when wearing medium or heavy armor. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Expanded Carrying Capacity Tables</b></p>
<p align="left">Table 9-1 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> shows carrying capacities for Medium bipeds. Larger or smaller bipeds have greater or smaller carrying capacities, as follows: <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Fine')">Fine</a> x1/8, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Diminutive')">Diminutive</a> x1/4, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Tiny')">Tiny</a> x1/2, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Small')">Small</a> x3/4, Large x2, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Huge')">Huge</a> x4, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Gargantuan')">Gargantuan</a> x8, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Colossal')">Colossal</a>
 x16. Calculating these values on the fly can be a chore, so I've 
calculated them for you. If you look at the numbers on the following 
tables, closely, you'll notice that not all of them conform strictly to 
the formulas. That's because Table 9-1 gives a continuous range of 
numbers for a Medium humanoid's carrying capacity. When you start 
multiplying the numbers on the table, you get gaps in the numbers, 
however. I've closed the gaps by adjusting the number at the lower end 
of each load range. The tables for bipeds that are size Small or 
smaller, I've given loads in pounds and ounces. This allowed me to give 
load numbers that are as close to the formula as possible.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What Is a Biped?</b></p>
<p align="left">A bipedal creature stands upright on two legs. In most 
cases, creatures of the following types usually should be treated as 
bipeds: fey, giants, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, outsiders, and 
undead. Be alert for exceptions. For example, a centaur is a monstrous 
humanoid, but its horse body makes it a quadruped. I've included 
outsiders and undead here because most of them have basically humanoid 
shapes, but not always. A yeth hound, for example, is an outsider and a 
quadruped. Most elementals and plants don't really have motive limbs, 
but are essentially upright and should use biped carrying capacities.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, many constructs, such as golems, are 
bipedal. Many aberrations are bipedal (such as mind flayers) or probably
 ought to use biped carrying capacity, such as beholders. Animals that 
use only two motive limbs at a time, such as most birds, should use 
biped carrying capacities. Some animals, such as monkeys and apes, can 
switch between locomotion types.</p>
