<p align="LEFT">Last week, we looked at a few <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> basics and considered one method <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DMs</a> can use to manage initiative during an encounter. As we saw last week, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">characters</a>
 enter initiative order when an encounter begins and stay in initiative 
order until the encounter is effectively over. This week, we'll consider
 just when an encounter begins.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Beginning an Encounter</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>D&amp;D</b> characters often act when they're not 
involved in encounters. Such actions might be as simple as walking down 
deserted corridors or as complex as making armor or making magic items. 
Such activities seldom require <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiativecheck')">initiative checks</a>.
 Some actions, such as opening doors, picking locks, and searching the 
shadows for hidden foes tend to generate conflict. So, exactly when do 
you check for initiative? Does initiative begin with the act that 
precipitates a battle, or does it begin after that act? To answer that 
question, it's helpful to consider just what the initiative rules are 
trying to accomplish.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Some Initiative Theory </b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From the page 25 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As a general rule, combat actions should only be 
performed in combat when you're keeping track of rounds and the players 
are acting in initiative order. You'll find obvious exceptions to this 
rule. For example, a cleric doesn't need to roll initiative to cast <i>cure light wounds </i>on
 a friend after the battle's over. Spellcasting and skill use are often 
used outside combat, and that's fine. Attacks, readied actions, charges,
 and other actions are meant to simulate combat, however, and are best 
used within the round structure.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in Part One, the <b>D&amp;D</b> game's 
initiative system is designed to promote quick and smooth play. The 
system's cyclical nature allows players to consider and execute their 
actions without the need to declare them ahead of time and allows them 
to anticipate when their turns to act are coming up.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The system's design also includes other features that 
aren't readily apparent. For example your character may gain the upper 
hand in a confrontation and press an advantage by anticipating your 
foe's maneuvers and countering them. In the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, you can
 do that through the delay or ready actions. These actions allow you to 
treat a high initiative result as an asset you can spend, but see the 
discussions of delay and ready in Part Three.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In spite of your ability to postpone your actions until a
 more advantageous time, you can't prepare for everything. Sometimes, 
you get caught with your pants down no matter how careful you are. This 
is why you cannot delay or ready until after you've made an initiative 
check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>When Does an Encounter Start?</b></p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>From the page 22 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> One side becomes aware of the other and thus can act first.</li>
<li>Both sides become aware of each other at the same time.</li>
<li>Some, but not all, creatures on one or both sides become aware of the other side.</li>
</ul>

<p align="LEFT">The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> says an encounter begins in one of three situations.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In each case, there is no encounter until at least one <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creature</a> is aware of at least one potential foe. Without this awareness, there is no encounter and no initiative order.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It might prove helpful to examine some potential encounter openings and determine when to make initiative checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Two Groups Meet in a Dungeon Corridor</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This is possibly the most straightforward encounter 
opening. The two sides check initiative when they notice each other, 
usually the moment when the two groups have line of sight to each other 
and thus can see each other.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>A Party Enters an Occupied Chamber by Kicking in the Door</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In many campaigns, most encounters will begin this way. 
There are many possible variations to this scenario, and some variations
 affect initiative.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Neither side notices the other before the door opens. </b>Such
 a situation might occur when the room's occupants aren't keeping watch 
beyond the chamber's closed door (or cannot do so) and the party also 
fails to notice that the chamber has occupants. The party might simply 
fail to check the door or their attempts to do so (such as Listen 
checks) fail.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In this case, the encounter doesn't truly begin until 
someone opens the door. The action used to open the door takes place 
before the encounter and the character who takes the action does so 
before anyone makes an initiative check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>One side notices the other before the door opens. </b>Perhaps
 the room's occupants have a peephole they can use to look beyond the 
door. Or perhaps the intruders have made a successful Listen check that 
reveals the room's occupants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Things are easier to handle here if the party notes the 
room's occupants first. When I'm running the game, things go like this: 
The character who notes the room's occupants gets a free action (outside
 of initiative) to notify allies about the potential foes beyond the 
door. The newly informed characters take time preparing to enter the 
room, also outside initiative.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the party is ready to hit the room, I run a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_surprise')">surprise </a><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a>. One or two characters open the door, and these characters act first. The <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moveaction')">move action</a>
 the characters use to open the door counts as the single action they 
are allowed during the surprise round. You're actually limited to one <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_standardaction')">standard action</a>
 when you act during a surprise round, but you can always use a move 
action in place of a standard action (but not vice versa); see page 138 
in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050614a">Rules of the Game: All About Actions</a></i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once the door opens, the remainder of the party takes 
the single standard actions (or move actions) they're allowed during a 
surprise round. Since it's usually best to handle actions one character 
at a time, I have the characters act in the order they're standing 
before the door or in the order of their initiative <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_modifier')">modifier</a>,
 whichever seems most appropriate for the situation. There still are no 
initiative checks because a surprise round represents a flurry of 
unexpected activity before a battle begins in earnest. After the party 
uses their surprise actions, everyone makes initiative checks. None of 
the PCs will be <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flatfooted')">flat-footed</a>, even if they don't act early in the initiative order, because they acted during the surprise round.</p>
<p align="LEFT">That's it. Once everyone checks initiative and I've 
recorded the initiative order, the encounter proceeds from there. Here 
are a few more things to consider:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Overall, the approach described here favors the group 
assaulting the room. It might seem a little harsh to make characters use
 their surprise actions to open the door, but the act takes some time 
and the defenders inside the room deserve a little break for being 
behind a closed door. Allowing the party to open the door before the 
surprise (so that the characters opening the door get to act against the
 foe along with their allies), would tilt the situation even further 
toward the attackers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You could make things tougher on the attackers by 
skipping the surprise round. The attackers could prepare themselves as 
noted earlier, but the encounter would not truly begin until the door 
opens. At that point, both parties would be aware of each other and 
initiative checks would be in order. If you choose this approach, it's 
reasonable to assume that the attackers might be flat-footed until their
 first actions. The party might know a battle is coming, but they're 
still subject to a moment of uncertainty when the actual event begins.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's worth noting here that peace officers and members 
of the military I've spoken with tell me that assaulting a closed, 
defended room can prove quite dangerous, especially if the defenders 
keep their heads. I tend to prefer an approach that favors the PCs 
because they're supposed to be the heroes and the stars of the campaign.
 You might choose differently, and so might I if the PCs face a 
particularly canny or well-prepared foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All the foregoing assumes that the characters entering 
the room notice the opposition first. What happens if the room's 
defenders are forewarned and the group entering the room remains unaware
 of what awaits them beyond the door? If the defenders decide to preempt
 their foes and attack, you can run the encounter exactly as described 
above, except that the group attacking from inside the room surprises 
the party outside.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the defenders decide to wait for the enemy to enter 
their chamber, they can use the time before the attack comes as they see
 fit. There's no need for initiative checks while the defenders prepare.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the party outside finally opens the door, everyone 
checks for initiative when the door opens. You can allow the group 
inside the room a surprise round first, but I don't recommend doing so. 
It usually doesn't pay to await a foe's action. Characters who know a 
confrontation is about to commence might want to ready actions. Doing so
 would bend the rules because you're not supposed to use the ready 
action until after an encounter starts. The DM, however, might want to 
allow readying in this special situation. In any case, ready is an 
action itself, and the character with the readied action must give up 
other preparations.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>A Party Opens a Chest and Releases an Imprisoned Fiend</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This situation really isn't much different from breaking
 into a closed room. The party opens the chest before the encounter 
really begins and nobody checks for initiative until the fiend emerges 
from its imprisonment. One side might surprise the other if they spot 
the opposition before being noticed themselves, just as noted 
previously. The DM also can adjust things to favor one side or the 
other, also as noted previously.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That's all the time we have this week. Next week, we'll 
consider the fine art of deciding just when an encounter ends. We'll 
also examine a few odds and ends related to initiative.</p>
