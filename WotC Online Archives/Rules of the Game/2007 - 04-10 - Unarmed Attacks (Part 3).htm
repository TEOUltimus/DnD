<p align="LEFT">This week, we'll delve into a few more issues arising from <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_monk')">monks'</a>
 unarmed attacks and we'll conclude our look into unarmed attacks with a
 few notes about using unarmed attacks with some selected class features
 and special attack actions.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Monks and Natural Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As we saw in Part Two, a creature with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalweapon')">natural weapons</a>
 can use them for secondary attacks when using the full attack action. A
 monk character with natural weaponry has the same option.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, an 8th-level lizardfolk monk with a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> score of 17 has a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack bonus</a> of +7 (+1 for its 2 humanoid <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDice')">Hit Dice</a>
 and +6 for its monk levels). The character has three natural weapons: 
two claws (1d4) and one bite (1d4). For this example, we'll assume the 
character also has the Multiattack feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">With the full attack action, our example monk can make 
two unarmed attacks thanks to its +7 base attack bonus. After adding in 
the +3 bonus from the monk's Strength score of 17, our example 
character's unarmed attacks have the following attack bonuses: +10/+5. 
Thanks to the monk's class level and Strength score, damage for the 
unarmed strikes is 1d10+3.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The example monk also can attack with its claws and bite as secondary natural attacks at a -2 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalty</a>
 (thanks to the character's Multiattack feat). Each natural weapon uses 
the character's +7 base attack bonus and +3 Strength modifier, except 
that the Strength bonus on damage is halved because these are secondary 
attacks: 2 claws +8 (1d4+1) and bite +8 (1d4+1).</p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted last week, there are no two-weapon or off-hand penalties for these attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The example monk cannot use a flurry of blows because a flurry doesn't work with natural weaponry.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Monks and Manufactured Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The most painless way for a monk to combine attacks with
 manufactured weapons and unarmed attacks is to use special monk weapons
 (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, or siangham). You can use
 any of these interchangeably with the monk's unarmed strikes -- even 
with a flurry of blows. You can even interchange ranged attacks with 
shuriken with melee attacks with unarmed attacks or special monk weapons
 as part of a flurry. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A monk using one or two special monk weapons simply 
substitutes one attack from each weapon (or from one or both ends of a 
quarterstaff) as part of a full attack (including a flurry of blows). 
The monk need not take any penalties for off-hand or two-weapon attacks.
 The monk, however, does not get an extra attack from a second weapon. 
If the monk is using a flurry of blows, she adds her full Strength bonus
 to damage from any successful attack, even if she uses what normally 
would be her off hand, or uses one end of a quarterstaff as a two-handed
 weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If a monk is not using her flurry of blows ability, she 
can claim an extra attack from a second weapon. If she does, she takes 
all the penalties for attacking with two weapons and for attacking with 
off-hand weapons. A monk using an unarmed strike as an off-hand attack 
does not suffer any off-hand penalties; however, under the regular rules
 for two-weapon fighting you get only one extra attack for an off-hand 
weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example a 7th-level monk with a Strength score of 15
 that uses a longspear as a primary weapon and makes an off-hand unarmed
 attack has attack bonuses that are +3 longspear, +7 unarmed. This 
breaks down as follows: The longspear is +5 base, +2 Strength, -4 
two-weapon (off-hand weapon is light). The unarmed strike is +5 base, +2
 Strength -- off-hand penalties don't apply to a monk's unarmed strike. 
Because a longspear is a two-handed weapon, damage from the weapon is 
1d8+3. Damage for the unarmed strike is 1d8+2 -- a monk gets her full 
Strength bonus for unarmed strikes, even when used as off-hand attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though it might seem odd to use a two-handed weapon such
 as a longspear as an off-hand weapon, there's no reason you could not 
treat it as one, though it isn't a very good idea. If the character in 
this example uses her unarmed strike as her primary weapon and her 
longspear as the off-hand weapon, she takes a -6 two-weapon penalty for 
her unarmed strike (the standard penalty for the primary weapon when the
 off-hand weapon is not light). The monk also takes a -10 on her 
longspear attack (the standard penalty when the off-hand weapon is not 
light).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Neither option explored here is as good as a flurry of 
blows, but a longspear is a reach weapon. Of course, to make attacks 
with both a longspear and an unarmed strike, our example monk would have
 to face enemies at varying distances.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 153 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">FLANKING</p>
<p align="LEFT">When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus 
if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to 
you on the opponent's opposite border or opposite corner.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When in doubt about whether two friendly characters 
flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two
 friendly characters' centers. If the line passes through opposite 
borders of the opponent's space (including corners of those borders), 
then the opponent is flanked.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Exception: </i>If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can't flank an opponent.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The process described here applies to any sort of 
weapon. For example, if a monk wears a spiked gauntlet, her unarmed 
attacks aren't enhanced in any way, but she could use the spiked 
gauntlet in a two-weapon attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Unarmed Attacks</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can perform any special attack that you can make 
with a bludgeoning melee weapon with an unarmed attack. Treat an unarmed
 strike as a light weapon. For example, you can try to sunder a foe's 
weapon with an unarmed attack, but you take a -4 penalty on the required
 opposed roll because you're using a light weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Unarmed Sneak Attacks </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can use an unarmed attack as a sneak attack if you 
meet all the requirements for sneak attacks. That is, your unarmed 
strike can be a sneak attack if your target is denied its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> bonus against your attack or if you <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flank')">flank</a> your foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Remember that you flank a foe when you make a melee 
attack and an ally threatens the same foe from the opposite side or 
corner of the foe's space. You still get the flanking bonus (and the 
ability to make a sneak attack) even if you don't threaten the foe's 
space because you're unarmed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the unarmed strike you use in a sneak attack deals <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonlethaldamage')">nonlethal damage</a>, all the damage from the sneak attack also is nonlethal -- even the bonus damage from the sneak attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you don't have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, you 
can deal normal damage with your unarmed strike by taking a -4 penalty 
on the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack roll</a>.
 If you do so, you still can make an unarmed sneak attack. This might 
seem odd, because if you choose to deal nonlethal damage with a weapon 
that normally deals <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lethaldamage')">lethal damage</a>
 (by taking a -4 penalty on the attack roll), you can't also make a 
sneak attack. However, using a normally lethal weapon represents using 
that weapon in a less than optimal manner, and that's what spoils your 
sneak attack. When you take a -4 attack penalty to deal lethal damage 
with an unarmed strike, you're really making super optimal use of the 
sneak attack -- the attack penalty merely represents the extra 
difficulty that act entails.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 176 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Touch Spells and Holding the Charge: </b>In most 
cases, if you don't discharge a touch spell on the round you cast it, 
you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) 
indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round. If you cast 
another spell, the touch spell dissipates.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some touch spells, such as <i>teleport </i>and <i>water walk, </i>allow
 you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can't hold the 
charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the 
same round that you finish casting the spell.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Unarmed Attacks and Touch Spells</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As Rules of the Game has noted before, you can use an unarmed attack to deliver a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a> with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_touchspell')">touch</a>
 range. You make the unarmed attack as you would normally. Your unarmed 
attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity because you're 
delivering a touch spell. If your attack roll is high enough to hit your
 target's regular <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>
 (not just its touch Armor Class), you deal unarmed strike damage and 
you also deliver the spell. If your attack roll fails to hit your 
target's regular Armor Class, the attack fails. It deals no damage and 
you don't deliver the spell either. You are, however, still holding the 
spell, just as if you failed with a touch attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>In Conclusion </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That wraps up our look at unarmed attacks. You don't 
need to be a monk to use unarmed attacks (though it helps). Remember 
that you're never completely without options when you're without a 
weapon.</p>
