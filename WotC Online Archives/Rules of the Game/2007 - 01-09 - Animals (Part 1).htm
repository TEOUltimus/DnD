<p align="LEFT">When player characters seek ways to improve their 
capabilities, they can do worse than purchasing an animal or two. 
Animals can carry gear (or loot), act as mounts, and serve as scouts, 
guardians, trackers, or fighting allies. The right animal might do all 
of these things. Some characters, such as <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ranger')">rangers</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_druid')">druids</a>,
 come more or less pre-equipped with companion animals (though rangers 
must wait awhile before acquiring animal companions), but others must 
purchase, and perhaps train, their animals.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unfortunately, animals usually complicate things when 
they enter play. What, exactly, can an animal do? How will it react when
 a nasty monster jumps out of the weeds? Just what kind of creature is 
an animal companion anyway, and what does it bring to your table? This 
series considers all these questions and more. <i>Rules of the Game</i> already examined <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050125a">mounts</a> in detail, so we'll concentrate on companion animals here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Animal Basics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Animals are best treated as <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonplayercharacter')">nonplayer characters</a>
 that act according to their instincts unless someone successfully 
orders them to do something else. The rules give little guidance about 
how animals act when not commanded, and we'll deal with that issue in 
Part Three. For the moment, let's concentrate on what you must do to get
 an animal to do what you want.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>Handle an Animal: </i>This task involves commanding 
an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. For instance, to 
command a trained attack dog to attack a foe requires a DC 10 Handle 
Animal check. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage
 or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds,
 the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"<i>Push" an Animal: </i>To push an animal means to get 
it to perform a task or trick that it doesn't know but is physically 
capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal 
perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour 
between sleep cycles (see Chapter 9: Adventuring). If the animal is 
wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the 
DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task 
or trick on its next action.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Train an Animal for a Purpose: </i>Rather than 
teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a 
general purpose. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a 
preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as 
guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal 
prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the 
package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an 
Intelligence score of 2.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, 
though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above 
and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. 
Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching 
individual tricks does, but no less time. At your DM's option, you may 
be able to train an animal for a purpose that isn't mentioned here.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider
 into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and 
heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also
 "upgrade" an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding
 by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal 
check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the 
animal's previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and 
riding dogs (see the <i>Monster Manual</i>) are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don't require any additional training for this purpose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat 
knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting
 takes three weeks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the 
tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding 
takes four weeks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor 
knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes
 two weeks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the
 tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal 
for hunting takes six weeks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance 
knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an 
animal for performance takes five weeks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows 
the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes 
three weeks.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Rear a Wild Animal: </i>To rear an animal means to 
raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A 
handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A 
successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time 
it's being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Action:</b> Varies. Handling an animal is a move 
action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or 
ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a 
move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must 
spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being 
handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the 
Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or
 train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing,
 or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder 
of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time 
is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the 
attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Try Again: </b>Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special:</b> You can use this skill on a creature 
with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC 
of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on 
tricks known as animals do. The <i>Monster Manual </i>provides information on teaching or training other kinds of creatures as appropriate.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on 
Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion. In addition, a 
druid's or ranger's animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, 
which don't count against the normal limit on tricks known and don't 
require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach. If you have 
the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Synergy: </b>If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Untrained: </b>If you have no ranks in Handle Animal,
 you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but 
you can't teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks
 in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal
 companion, but she can't teach, rear, or train other nondomestic 
animals.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The rules given in the Handle Animal skill define what animals can do during encounters. You make Handle Animal <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_check')">checks</a> to control a trained animal during an encounter -- untrained animals act independently unless you can use a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a> or other ability to gain control over them. You can find the Handle Animal skill description on pages 74-75 in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> but here's an overview, along with a few additional notes and comments:</p>
<ul>
<li> An animal usually does not obey commands or do anything useful for a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a> unless it has received training to perform one or more tricks.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The tricks an animal knows define what it can do on a 
character's behalf. You can attempt to get an animal to perform a trick 
it does not know.</p>
<p align="LEFT">By definition, an animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. An animal can learn three tricks per point of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a>
 it has. Teaching an animal a trick takes at least one week of work and a
 Handle Animal check. A trainer can work with multiple animals, but the 
trainer must spend at least 3 hours a day working with each animal. For 
example, working with three animals requires 9 hours of work each day.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can save some time by training an animal for general
 purpose instead of teaching it individual tricks. A general purpose is a
 set of tricks with a common theme. You teach the animal all the tricks 
in the set at once, but each trick counts against the total number of 
tricks the animal can learn. You can train an animal for only one 
general purpose; if a general purpose contains 4 or more tricks, the 
animal must have an Intelligence score of 2 to learn it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The rules don't say so, but an animal you train must be 
fairly tame and must trust you. Wild or fearful animals do not learn 
anything unless you can calm them and develop a rapport with them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">See the Handle Animal skill description for more notes about training animals.</p>
<ul>
<li> An animal usually does not do anything during an encounter unless you give it a command by making a Handle Animal check.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Giving a command is move <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a> for you if you order the animal to perform a trick it knows, and the check <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a>
 is 10. You can command an animal to perform a trick it does not know, 
provided that the animal is physically capable of performing the trick. 
Doing so is a full-round action, and the DC is 25 (the DC for "pushing" 
an animal). An animal could perform a trick in some situations and may 
not have the ability to do that trick in other situations. For example, 
no animal can fetch an item that weighs more that it can lift, but even 
if it fails to lift an item you command it to fetch, you could have it 
try to fetch something lighter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The rules don't give any conditions or range limits for 
giving an animal a command. Common sense suggests that the animal must 
be able to see or hear you -- so that it can respond to your gestures or
 voice. Under most conditions, 60 feet is a practical distance limit for
 commanding an animal, though you could extend that by using a whistle 
or something else audible at a greater distance.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can push an animal to do something it would not normally do.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> As noted previously, you can push an animal to perform a
 trick it does not know. You also can push an animal to hustle or make a
 forced march, as noted in the Handle Animal skill description. The 
rules don't say so, but you also can push an animal to do other things, 
such as attacking foes it would not normally attack, swimming a rapids, 
or leaping a wide chasm.</p>
<ul>
<li> A trained animal acts on its handler's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> number.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The rules don't specifically mention this, but the 
handler must act to command the animal, and that has to happen on the 
handler's turn. You may want to have a trained animal delay its action 
at least until the handler has a chance to act.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can rear a wild animal so that it becomes trainable.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> If you find an infant animal, you can raise it to 
adulthood and domesticate it in the process. You can teach an animal 
tricks or general purposes while rearing it. See the Handle Animal skill
 description for details.</p>
<ul>
<li> If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can make a Charisma check to command or push an animal.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Untrained characters cannot rear or train animals.</p>
