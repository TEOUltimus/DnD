<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="590">
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">This week, we'll finish our look at actions by examining full-round actions and various special actions.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Full-Round Actions</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, a full-round action uses up all 
your time in a round. You can't combine a full-round action with a 
standard or a move action, though if your full-round action does not 
involve moving any distance, you can take a 5-foot step.</p>
<p align="left">Remember that you complete a full-round action during 
your turn. You do not have to wait until the next round to complete the 
action (unless you use two standard actions to start the action during 
one turn and finish it the next; see Part Three).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Full Attack: </b>This works just like the attack 
standard action except that you can make any extra attacks you have 
available because of your base attack bonus or equipment. You do not 
need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see 
how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.</p>
<p align="left">You decide between the full attack and attack actions 
after you make your first attack. If you decide to use a move action 
after attacking, then your first attack is considered the attack 
standard action. Even if you choose the full attack action, you can take
 a 5-foot step before, after, or during the action. You can interrupt 
your attacks with a 5-foot step to bring new opponents within reach.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cast a Spell: </b>Spells with 1 round casting times 
break the rule about completing full-round actions during your turn. You
 use a full-round action to cast the spell, but the spell comes into 
effect just before the beginning of your turn in the round after you 
began casting the spell.</p>
<p align="left">When a spell takes longer than 1 round to cast, you use a
 full-round action each turn for the entire casting time, and the spell 
takes effect just before your turn the round after you finish. For 
example, a spell with a 1-minute casting time comes into effect just 
before your turn 1 minute later. Your full-round actions must be 
consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails. You 
can, however, take a 5-foot step each round you spend casting.</p>
<p align="left">When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to 
cast, you must continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration 
from one round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If
 you lose concentration after starting the spell and before it is 
complete, you lose the spell. Any material or XP components the spell 
requires are used up when you begin the spell.</p>
<p align="left">You provoke attacks of opportunity only when you begin 
casting a spell, even though you might continue casting for at least 1 
full round. While casting a spell, you don't threaten any squares around
 you.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>From
 PH pg 188: "Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats: A cleric 
spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic 
version of it instead. For instance, an 11th-level cleric can swap out a
 prepared 6th-level spell to cast an empowered cure critical wounds 
spell. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action 
metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a
 longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast."</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Spontaneous spellcasters, such as sorcerers and bards, 
must use at least a full-round action to cast spells modified with 
metamagic feats. If such a spell has a casting time of less than 1 
round, the character uses one full-round action to cast the spell, and 
the spell takes effect on the character's turn (see page 88 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).
 If the spell has a casting time of 1 round or longer, the spellcaster 
must use an extra full-round action to complete the spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Use Special Ability:</b> As noted in Part Three, 
using a special ability is usually a standard action, but some may be 
full-round actions, as defined in the ability description.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Withdraw: </b>When you withdraw, you can move up to 
double your speed. The space you start out in is not considered 
threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies do
 not get attacks of opportunity against you when you move from that 
space. (Enemies you cannot see still get attacks of opportunity against 
you, and you can't withdraw from combat if you're blinded.)</p>
<p align="left">The withdraw action doesn't exempt you from attacks of 
opportunity when you leave spaces other than the first one you exit 
during the withdraw action. Because you move when you withdraw, you 
cannot take a 5-foot step during the same turn.</p>
<p align="left">If you're limited to a standard action during your turn, you can withdraw as a standard action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Run:</b> When you run, you can move up to four times 
your speed in a straight line (or three times your speed if you're in 
heavy armor). You lose any Dexterity bonus to AC unless you have the Run
 feat. You can run for only a limited time; see page 144 in the<i> Player's Handbook. </i>You can't run if the terrain slows your movement or if you can't see where you're going.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Move 5 Feet Through Difficult Terrain:</b> In some 
situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don't have 
sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (a single square). In such a case, 
you may spend a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any 
direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, 
it's not (you can't take a 5-foot step if your movement is hampered), 
and thus it provokes attacks of opportunity normally.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Special Actions</b></p>
<p align="left">Most special actions are standard actions or nonactions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aid Another:</b> As a standard action, you can help a
 friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent.
 The opponent must be within melee reach. You make an attack roll 
against Armor Class 10. If you succeed, your friend gains either a +2 
bonus on his next melee attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus 
to Armor Class against that opponent's next melee attack (your choice), 
as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. 
Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and the bonuses stack.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>From
 PH pg 154: "Aid Another: In melee combat, you can help a friend attack 
or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If you're in 
position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend
 in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a standard 
action. You make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed, your 
friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that 
opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent's next attack (your 
choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next 
turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses 
stack."</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">You also can use this action to assist with a skill check, as noted on page 154 of the <i>Player's Handbook. </i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Bull Rush:</b> You perform a bull rush as a standard 
action (the attack action) or as part of a charge. You must move into 
your foe's space to initiate a bull rush. If you're charging, moving 
into the foe's space is part of your charge movement (this is an 
exception to the general rule against charging through occupied spaces).
 If you're bull rushing with the attack action, you must move into the 
foe's space using a move action or a 5-foot step. See page 154 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information on bull rushing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Charge:</b> The charge action lets you move up to 
twice your speed in a straight line and make a single melee attack. If 
you're limited to standard actions during your turn, you can charge as a
 standard action, moving up to your speed. Because you move when you 
charge, you cannot take a 5-foot step during the same turn. See page 154
 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information on charging.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Disarm:</b> You can attempt to disarm someone as a 
melee attack. You usually use the attack or full attack action for a 
disarm, but you also can disarm as an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">You can knock something out of a creature's hands with 
the disarm action, or you can use a free hand to snatch away something. 
In the latter case, you wind up with the target item in your hand if the
 disarm succeeds. See page 155 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information on disarming.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Feint:</b> Feinting is a standard action you use in melee combat. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't say so, but you may want to assume that 
your foe does not notice a successful feint attempt. If a player 
character is subjected to feint attempt, the DM should make the required
 opposed check (see page 155 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>) secretly. 
To take advantage of a successful feint, you must make a melee attack 
against your foe on or before your next turn. If you cannot make the 
attack in time, the feint is wasted.</p>
<p align="left">The Improved Feint feat allows you to feint as a move action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Grapple: </b>You grapple using the attack or full-attack action. Grappling requires several steps; see Page 155 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>and <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050301a">Rules of the Game: All About Grappling</a></i>.</p>
<p align="left">Initially in a grapple, you grab your foe as an attack 
action; all the opposed grapple checks you make after that to resolve 
the grapple attempt are nonactions for you and for your opponent. 
Because you grapple as a melee attack, you can initiate a grapple as an 
attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">If you begin your turn with a foe in your grasp (or vice
 versa), your initial grapple check to affect your foe (or escape) is an
 attack action and the check your foe makes to resist you is a 
nonaction.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Overrun:</b> You attempt an overrun as a standard 
action that you take concurrently with a move action. This means that 
you can move up to your speed when overrunning. (As noted in the errata 
for the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> you cannot overrun as part of a charge.) See page 157 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for more information on overruns.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sunder:</b> You can attempt to sunder an object as a 
melee attack. You usually use the attack or full attack action for a 
sunder, but you also can sunder as an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Throw Splash Weapon:</b> You throw a splash weapon as
 a ranged attack. It takes a move action to draw a splash weapon (though
 if it is stored in easy reach, you can draw it as a nonaction as part 
of a move or as a free action with the Quick Draw feat). You use the 
attack or full attack action to throw a splash weapon. If your splash 
weapon requires any special preparations, such as lighting a wick, you 
need a full-round action to prepare the weapon. The splash weapon 
descriptions in Chapter 7 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> (acid, 
alchemist's fire, and holy water) make no mention of preparation and I 
recommend that DMs simply allow characters to draw and throw these 
weapons. Save the prepare splash weapon action for improvised splash 
weapons such as flasks of lamp oil.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trip:</b> You can attempt to trip someone as a melee 
attack. You usually use the attack or full attack action for a trip, but
 you also can trip as an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">Tripping usually is an unarmed attack, but you can use 
some weapons to make trip attacks as well. Refer to the weapon's 
description to determine if it's useful for tripping.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>From
 PH pg 160: "Initiative Consequences of Readying: Your initiative result
 becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to 
your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you 
don't get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same 
action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before
 your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new 
point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action 
that round."</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Turn or Rebuke Undead:</b> You turn or rebuke as a 
standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, which is 
the norm for a supernatural ability. The rules don't say so, but it may 
help to treat a turn or rebuke as a supernatural effect that fills a 
burst (60 feet in the case of a cleric or paladin, though be aware that 
it has a maximum number of targets it can affect, and the effect cannot 
exceed a designated HD cap). See page 159 in the <i>Player's Handbook </i>for details on turning and rebuking.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Two-Weapon Fighting:</b> As noted in Part Three, you must use the full attack action to attack with multiple weapons.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ready:</b> You can use a standard action to prepare another action later in the round. Readying does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>From
 PH pg 160: "Distracting Spellcasters: You can ready an attack against a
 spellcaster with the trigger "if she starts casting a spell." If you 
damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to cast 
(as determined by her Concentration check result). Readying a Weapon 
against a Charge: You can ready certain piercing weapons, setting them 
to receive charges (see Table 7-5: Weapons, page 116). A readied weapon 
of this type deals double damage if you score a hit with it against a 
charging character."</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">You can ready a standard action, a move action, or a 
free action; regardless of the readied action, it always costs you a 
standard action to ready it. When you ready, you must specify the action
 you will take and the conditions under which you will take it. It pays 
to be as general as possible when specifying conditions. For example, 
it's far better to prepare to shoot the first creature that comes around
 a corner than the first orc that comes around the corner (unless you 
really are interested in shooting only orcs, or if you're concerned that
 an ally may come around the corner). When in doubt, ask your DM how 
specific you must be.</p>
<p align="left">If you do not take your readied action by the time your 
next turn comes, your opportunity to act is lost, but you can ready your
 action (or another action) again. When you take a readied action, your 
initiative number changes, as noted on page 160 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
 When you take your readied action, you usually resolve your action 
before resolving whatever triggered the readied action. For example, if 
you readied to shoot a creature coming around a corner, you take the 
shot before your foe completes his movement. You can use a readied 
action to disrupt an enemy's spell or deal extra damage to a charging 
enemy, as noted in the <i>Player's Handbook. </i></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>From
 PH pg 160: "Initiative Consequences of Delaying: Your initiative result
 becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you come to 
your next action and have not yet performed an action, you don't get to 
take a delayed action (though you can delay again). If you take a 
delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, 
your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, 
and you do not get your regular action that round."</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Delay:</b> Delay is a nonaction you use to put off 
your turn until a point in the initiative order that's more favorable to
 you. You act normally (that is you can choose from the menu of actions 
noted in Part One) when you finally decide to act. When you finally take
 your delayed action, your initiative number changes, as noted on page 
160 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> If you delay until another 
creature's turn, you can choose to act either before or after that 
creature acts, but of you choose to act before the creature, you must do
 so before you know what that creature will do.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Readying vs. Delaying:</b> Readying gives you fewer options than delaying, but readying also allows you to interrupt a foe's action, as noted above.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="left">That wraps up our look at actions. I hope the overview 
presented here proves helpful when you're pondering your next feat of 
derring-do.</p>
