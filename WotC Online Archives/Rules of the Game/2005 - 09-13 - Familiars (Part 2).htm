<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-13%20-%20Familiars%20%28Part%202%29_files/dxrg_familiardragon.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="197" width="271">Last week, we considered a few basics about familiars, from effective <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDice')">Hit Dice</a> through <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a>. This week, we'll look at more familiar basics, including Alertness, improved evasion, sharing <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a>, empathic link, and delivering <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_touchspell')">touch spells</a>.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>More Special Abilities </b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, most of these abilities are affected by proximity to the master or the master's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_level')">level</a>, or both.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar gives the master the benefits of the Alertness feat when it is within arm's reach of the master.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">When a familiar's master is at least 1st level, the master gains a +2 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> on Spot and Listen <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">checks</a> when the familiar is nearby. These bonuses don't stack with the Alertness feat (if the master has it).</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't define "arm's reach" as it applies to familiars. It's worth noting, however, that the <i>Player's Handbook</i> is written with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Small')">Small</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a>
 characters in mind. It is also written so as to downplay the 5-foot 
grid that governs movement and combat. So, the master gains the benefits
 of the Alertness feat while the familiar is within 5 feet and while 
there is an unbroken <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofeffect')">line of effect</a>
 between the master and the familiar (but see below). For example, if 
there's a closed door between the master and familiar, the master 
doesn't get the Alertness benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar gains the improved evasion special quality.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If a familiar with a master of at least 1st level is subjected to an attack that normally allows a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Reflexsave')">Reflex saving throw</a> for half <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>,
 the familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and 
half damage even if the saving throw fails. The familiar gets the 
benefit of this ability even when <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flatfooted')">flat-footed</a> or denied a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> bonus (though in the latter case it probably is less likely to make a successful save).</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar and master can share spells.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> The master decides when spells are shared. To be 
shared, the master must cast the spell and the spell must have the 
master as its target. The spell must have a target entry; effect and 
area spells cannot be shared. See <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a>
 for a discussion of targets, effects, and areas. Spells with touch 
range cannot be shared unless the master targets himself with the touch.</p>
<p align="left">The master and familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar's type (usually <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_magicalbeasttype')">magical beast</a>). The shared spell does not have to be an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_arcanespell')">arcane spell</a>; any spell the master casts himself can be shared with the familiar. The master cannot share <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spelllikeability')">spell-like abilities</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_supernaturalability')">supernatural abilities</a>, nor can the master and familiar share effects from magic items.</p>
<p align="left">To share a spell, the familiar must be within 5 feet of 
the master and there must be an unbroken line of effect between the 
master and the familiar. If the shared spell has a duration other than 
instantaneous, the familiar must remain with 5 feet of the master and 
maintain an unbroken line of effect to the master or lose the spell's 
benefits. Once the familiar loses the benefits from a particular casting
 of a spell, it cannot regain them again.</p>
<p align="left">When the familiar and the master share a spell, they 
function as one being where the spell's effects are concerned. For 
example, if the master chooses to share a <i>teleport</i> spell with his familiar, the familiar doesn't count toward the spell's creature limit. Likewise, if the master shares a <i>water breathing</i>
 spell with his familiar, the familiar shares the master's portion of 
the spell's duration and does not count as another creature touched. A 
shared <i>mirror image</i> spell creates duplicates of both the master 
and the familiar, and a successful hit on either the master's or the 
familiar's image eliminates one duplicate master and one duplicate 
familiar. A shared <i>protection from energy </i>spell shields both the 
master and the familiar, but all energy damage that either the familiar 
or the master suffers is deducted from the total amount of energy the 
spell can absorb.</p>
<p align="left">In spite of the foregoing, some aspects of the master 
and familiar always remain distinct. The master and familiar have two 
separate pools of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>. If the master casts a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_curespell')">cure wounds spell</a>,
 the hit points bestowed must go either to the master or to the 
familiar. If points are left over after the chosen recipient reaches 
full hit points, the excess can go to the other pool. In a similar 
fashion, the master and familiar both have their own ability scores, and
 magic that enhances or improves an ability score must all go to either 
the master or the familiar.</p>
<p align="left">Some spells have benefits that can be fully shared and 
other benefits that must be allocated to the familiar or to the master. 
For example, an <i>aid</i> spell grants temporary hit points and bestows a +1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moralebonus')">morale bonus</a> on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack rolls</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saves</a> against fear effects. If the master and the familiar share an <i>aid</i> spell, only one of them gets the temporary hit points, but both receive the morale bonus.</p>
<p align="left">Some spells require special handling when shared. See <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040511a">Rules of the Game: All About Polymorph</a> for an example.</p>
<p align="left">The master also has the option of casting any spell with
 a target of "you" on the familiar as a spell with touch range. If the 
master does so, he does not share the effect with the familiar, but the 
familiar retains the spell's benefits for as long as the spell lasts no 
matter where the familiar goes afterward.</p>
<ul>
<li> The familiar and master have an empathic link with a range of one mile.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The rules don't say so, but master and familiar don't need <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofsight')">line of sight</a>
 or line of effect to each other for the empathic link to work. The 
link, however, does not cross planar boundaries. If the master and 
familiar are on different planes, the link is temporarily broken, just 
as though they were out of range. This is a supernatural ability, so if 
either the master or the familiar is within an <i>antimagic field,</i> telepathic communication between the two is not possible.</p>
<p align="left">Empathy is nonverbal, but limited. The master and 
familiar don't share senses and can exchange only emotions. This 
requires as much effort as speaking (usually a free action), but 
empathic communication doesn't require a common language (or any 
language at all).</p>
<p align="left">So, what, exactly, can a master and familiar communicate
 over the empathic link? As noted earlier, the link only transmits basic
 emotions, such as fear, hunger, happiness, or curiosity. So, the link 
is useful only for determining the master or familiar's emotional state.
 The familiar or master can report a state of fear over the link, but 
not what's causing that fear. You can reasonably assume that the link 
can transmit intensity of emotion. I suggest a four-step system: faint 
emotion (the merest stirring of an emotion, such as a feeling of fear 
when approaching a creepy building); moderate emotion (notable emotion, 
such as seeing a dangerous creature fairly close by); strong emotion 
(emotion that floods the mind, such as fear felt when a dangerous 
creature attacks); overwhelming emotion (emotion that drives out all 
other thoughts and feelings, such as when a dangerous creature has you 
in its claws).</p>
<p align="left">Certain other key bits of information can travel over 
the empathic link (though the rules don't specifically say they do). If 
your familiar makes a successful saving throw against a hostile spell 
and feels a tingle, you'll feel the tingle, too. Likewise, you'll know 
if the familiar is <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_unconscious')">unconscious</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_dazed')">dazed</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_stunned')">stunned</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nauseated')">nauseated</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_sickened')">sickened</a>,
 or suffering from any other impairment that keeps it from acting. If 
the familiar falls prey to a charm or compulsion effect, you'll sense 
the familiar's muddled state of mind.</p>
<p align="left">Some familiars (such as ravens and some improved 
familiars) have the ability to speak a language. Such familiars can use 
their empathic link power, but it still carries only basic emotions. The
 familiar can converse in the language the familiar knows (provided that
 the master also knows that language), but the two must be within normal
 speaking range to do so.</p>
<p align="left">The empathic link makes a familiar an extension of the 
master's being, which means that when a familiar has been somewhere or 
experienced something, the master has the same connection to it as the 
familiar has. Once a familiar has been in a room, for example, the 
master can use a <i>teleport</i> spell to travel to that room as though 
he had been there himself. Likewise, if the familiar has seen an object,
 the master can use a <i>locate object</i> spell to find that object as 
though he had seen it himself (even though the master cannot view the 
object through the familiar's eyes while the familiar looks at it).</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar can deliver touch spells for its master if the master is 3rd level or higher.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">When casting a spell with touch range, the master can 
designate his familiar as the "toucher." The master and the familiar 
must be touching at the time of casting, and this requires the familiar 
and master to share the same space or be in adjacent spaces.</p>
<p align="left">Once designated, the familiar can deliver the touch 
spell just as the master could. As normal, if the master casts another 
spell, the touch spell dissipates. If the familiar touches anything, the
 spell also dissipates.</p>
<p align="left">Delivering a touch spell is a supernatural ability. The familiar uses an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a> to touch the spell recipient, usually the attack action, but no action is required to trigger the ability to deliver the spell.</p>
<p align="left">Some touch spells have noticeable effects after they 
have been cast, and those effects are transferred to the familiar. For 
example, the <i>chill touch</i> spell makes the caster's hand glow blue. If the caster uses his familiar to deliver <i>chill touch,</i> the familiar glows blue.</p>
<p align="left">The spell to be delivered does not have to be an arcane spell; the familiar can deliver any touch spell the master casts.</p>
<p align="left">The familiar can make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleetouchattack')">melee touch attack</a> to deliver the spell, or the familiar can use a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_naturalweapon')">natural weapon</a> to make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee attack</a> that delivers the spell. In the latter case, the attack must defeat the defender's normal <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>,
 but a hit deals the attack's normal damage plus the spell effect. If 
the familiar misses with the natural weapon, it is still holding the 
spell. If the familiar is allowed more than one attack, the first attack
 in the series that hits delivers the spell.</p>
<p align="left">It's worth noting that all the foregoing applies to spells with range touch (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a></i>). Sometimes, a spell allows the caster to make a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedtouchattack')">ranged touch attack</a> to deliver the spell. Such a spell does not have touch range.</p>
