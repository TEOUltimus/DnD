<p align="left">Last week we touched on the basics of <b>D&amp;D</b> 
magic, spells, and spell preparation. This week, we'll conclude our look
 at spell preparation and explore a few more issues concerning spells.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spell Preparation Requirements and Options </b></p>
<p align="left">Once a character sleeps 8 hours or reaches the 
designated time of day, the way is clear for preparing spells -- 
provided the spellcaster can clear a few more hurdles:</p>
<ul>
<li> Spell preparation requires concentration.<br><br> In this case, 
concentration requires freedom from overt distractions. The rules 
include a short list of distractions that prevent spell preparation: 
combat nearby, exposure to inclement weather, injury, or a failed saving
 throw (see page 178 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>), but otherwise 
leave the DM free to decide when distractions are sufficient to prevent 
spell preparation. Here are some additional rules of thumb.<br><br> 
Combat nearby interferes with spell preparation when the DM decides that
 the character has a reasonable chance to become involved in the fight. 
This occurs whenever the character is within range of a foe's ranged 
attacks or spells and one of those spells or ranged attacks is directed 
at the character or anywhere the character could reach with a double 
move. Likewise, a character could reasonably become involved in a fight 
whenever the character finds himself within a double move of any ally or
 enemy that is attacking or being attacked during the fight. Use either 
the character's speed or the enemy or ally's speed, whichever is 
greater, to determine the distance. These are guidelines, not hard and 
fast rules. The key element is the potential danger to the character 
attempting to prepare spells and the character's ability to perceive 
that danger. If the character trying to prepare spells remains 
blissfully unaware of the fight, it's a good bet the fight won't 
distract the character from spell preparation.<br><br> Weather is 
inclement and sufficiently harsh to disrupt spell preparation when it 
can damage, fatigue, or otherwise hinder the character. As a rule of 
thumb, I recommend that winds of moderate or stronger force (see Table 
3-24 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>), interfere with spell 
preparation, at least for any character who uses spellbooks to prepare 
spells. Characters who don't have to read spellbooks probably don't have
 to worry about spell preparation until the wind reaches at least strong
 force.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Precipitation of any kind intense enough to reduce 
vision or provide concealment also interferes with spell preparation, as
 does heat or cold intense enough to deal damage (lethal or nonlethal) 
or to cause the character to become fatigued or exhausted.</p>
<p align="left">DMs might want to make some exceptions to these rules 
for divine spellcasters who revere nature or the elements or who are 
associated with nature or elemental deities. A druid, for example, might
 not find even a severe thunderstorm distracting when it comes to 
preparing spells.</p>
<ul>
<li>A character needs 1 hour to prepare his daily allotment of spells, no matter how many spells that might be.<br><br>
 The rules don't say what happens when spell preparation is interrupted;
 however, the rules say that the minimum time to prepare any spell is 15
 minutes (the time required to achieve the correct mental state). 
Therefore, a DM could decide that a spellcaster prepares no spells at 
all if interrupted less than 15 minutes after commencing spell 
preparation. Otherwise, a character prepares about a quarter of his 
daily spell allotment every 15 minutes spent in preparation until all 
his daily spells are prepared.<br><br> Since a spellcaster doesn't have 
to prepare all his spells at once (see the next section), being 
interrupted during spell preparation doesn't have much effect on a 
character except that the character must function with less than his 
full daily allotment for a time.<br><br></li>
<li>A character need not prepare all his spells at once.<br><br> A 
character who prepares spells can opt to halt spell preparation at any 
time. If he does so, he prepares about a quarter of his available spell 
slots for every 15 minutes spent in preparation (see the previous 
section). All the character's remaining spell slots still can hold 
spells during the current day (subject to the rule on recent 
spellcasting, see the section on rest), but the character cannot fill 
them with spells until he takes the time to prepare spells for them. See
 page 178 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details.<br><br> A 
character might find it handy to leave a few spell slots empty at the 
start of the day so he can fill them later when he has a better idea 
what spells he might need. When filling the empty slots, the character 
still needs the proper environment (see the previous sections) and at 
least 15 minutes of preparation time.<br><br></li>
<li>When initially preparing spells for the day, a character can fill 
any spell slots used up the previous day (subject to the recent casting 
limit rule). The character also can replace any unused spells left over 
from the previous day. The character doesn't have the option to replace 
previously prepared spells if he chooses to wait and prepare some spells
 later in the day.<br><br></li>
<li>When selecting a spell to place into an available spell slot, a 
character can choose any spell of the slot's level or lower, provided 
that the chosen spell is one the character normally can prepare.<br><br>
 This option allows you to load up with a few extra copies of your 
favorite spell. It's also a good way to use spell slots that you have 
available, but of a level too high for you. For example, Cinda, an 
11th-level wizard with an Intelligence score of 15 normally has a single
 6th-level spell slot available each day. A wizard, however, needs an 
Intelligence score of at least 16 to cast a 6th-level spell (see page 56
 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Fortunately, Cinda can place a spell 
of 5th level or lower into the 6th-level spell slot. The spell functions
 at its usual spell level despite being in a higher-level slot. For 
example, if Cinda places a 5th-level <i>cone of cold</i> spell in her 
otherwise unusable 6th-level spell slot, the spell has a saving throw DC
 of 17 (10 + spell level + Cinda's Intelligence modifier of +2). All 
other variables or characteristics that depend on the example spell's 
level, such as its ability to penetrate a <i>globe of invulnerability</i> effect, function at the spell's original level (5th).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Instinctive Spellcasting </b></p>
<p align="left">Some spellcasters (such as sorcerers and bards) have a 
natural talent for spellcasting and essentially employ a spell merely by
 completing its final portion. An instinctive caster readies spells each
 day rather preparing them (see page 179 in the <i>Players Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="left">To ready spells for the day, an instinctive caster must 
first rest for 8 hours. This works exactly as described in Part One for 
characters who prepare spells.</p>
<p align="left">After waking, an instinctive caster requires 15 minutes 
of concentration to make all his daily spell slots available. The rules 
don't specifically say so, but this works much like preparing spells, at
 least in terms of the environment required. The rules don't say what 
happens if the character is interrupted, but DMs may want to rule that 
an interruption foils the attempt to ready spells and that the character
 can simply try again when conditions permit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spontaneous Spellcasting </b></p>
<p align="left">Clerics (and other divine spellcasters, such as druids) can cast spells spontaneously; see page 32 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 and Rules of the Game: All About Clerics {{link}}. To spontaneously 
cast a spell, a character uses up a previously prepared spell and casts 
the spontaneous spell instead, rechanneling the prepared spell's raw 
magical force or energy into the new spell. Doing so doesn't require any
 special effort, but the character needs a prepared spell to convert 
into the desired spell. I suppose the character could use an empty spell
 slot the character has saved from her initial spell preparation for the
 day (see the previous section) for the spontaneous spell, but that 
doesn't match the spirit (or the letter) of the rule.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spells and Saves </b></p>
<p align="left">Spells that harm, alter, hinder, or otherwise affect a 
subject usually allow saving throws to resist their effects. Kinds of 
saving throws and the results of a successful save are detailed on pages
 176 and 177 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and in Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Reading Spell Descriptions</a>. People overlook a few other things about saves.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What the Subject Knows:</b> Whenever a spell (or 
other magical effect) that has obvious physical results affects a 
subject that has a Wisdom score, the subject is aware of those effects. 
As an unofficial rule of thumb, obvious physical effects include damage,
 transformation, disability, or other effects that the subject can see, 
hear, feel, taste, smell, or otherwise perceive or deduce using the 
normal human senses. The subject notices the spell's effects even if the
 subject fails a saving throw (if one is allowed). If the magical effect
 kills the subject or renders the subject unconscious, the DM might 
decide that the subject doesn't notice what hit her. If the attack 
happens when the victim is flat-footed and the caster is unseen or 
unnoticed, a DC 15 Wisdom, Spot, or Listen check (whichever the DM 
thinks is most appropriate) can determine if the subject realizes what's
 happening before losing consciousness. As always, adjust the DC up or 
down according to the circumstances.</p>
<p align="left">Even when the subject notices obvious physical effects, 
she does not necessarily know that a spell or other magic was involved. A
 Spellcraft check with a DC of 20 + the spell level reveals the spell. 
When the effect is not a spell, assign it a level based on a spell with a
 similar effect. A dragon's breath weapon, for example, might be the 
equivalent of a 3rd- or 4th-level spell for this purpose. The DM might 
waive the Spellcraft check when the spell or effect is something the 
character has used or witnessed before.</p>
<p align="left">When a spell or other magic has no obvious physical 
effects, a subject that fails a saving throw remains unaware of the 
assault. If the subject makes a successful saving throw, she feels a 
hostile tingle. This is true whether the successful save completely 
negates the spell or results in a reduced or partial effect. The subject
 knows she has shaken off some hostile magic, but gains no clues about 
what the effect was or what its source might be.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What the Caster Knows:</b> When a spell has a target 
entry, the caster knows when the target makes a successful saving throw 
or not. The caster immediately senses when a target makes a successful 
saving throw and likewise knows if a target has failed a saving throw by
 virtue of not noticing a successful saving throw. When a spell can 
affect several targets at once, the caster notes each successful or 
failed saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">The caster does not sense successful or failed saving throws when a spell has an area or effect entry instead of a target entry.</p>
<p align="left">For magical effects that aren't presented in the same 
format as a spell, refer to a similar spell to determine if the user can
 sense a successful or failed saving throw. For example, a supernatural 
or spell-like ability that works just like the <i>charm monster</i> spell is a targeted effect and the user knows when the target's save succeeds or fails.</p>
