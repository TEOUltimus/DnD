This week, we'll briefly examine the joys of fighting with a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_doubleweapon')">double weapon</a>, then we'll move on to a few examples of two-weapon fighting and wrap up by considering a few related topics.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fighting with a Double Weapon</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in Part One, a double weapon has a striking, 
cutting, or piercing implement at each end. When creating a masterwork 
or magical double weapon, you need to pay the appropriate costs for each
 end of the weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Many people work very hard at making double weapons 
complex and difficult to use in play. There's no need to agonize over a 
double weapon, however. In combat, you can use just one end of a double 
weapon or both ends. If you choose to use both ends, you resolve the 
attacks exactly as if you were using a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_onehandedweapon')">one-handed weapon</a> and a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lightweapon')">light weapon</a>. (One of the examples in the following sections uses a double weapon.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you choose to use only one end of a double weapon, 
you get to choose which end to use (though some double weapons have 
identical game statistics). No matter which end you choose, you wield 
the double weapon in two hands and you gain 1-1/2 times your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> bonus on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a> from a hit. This feature makes double weapons particularly useful. You can employ both ends when you can use the full attack <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a>. When you're limited to the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a>
 action (such as when you must use a move action to get within melee 
reach of your foe), you can use just one end and wield the weapon in two
 hands for a little extra damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Two-Weapon Fighting Examples</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The concepts presented so far in this series ought to become clear with the following examples.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fighting with Two One-Handed Weapons: </b>Alcantar is a 7th-level human <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fighter')">fighter</a>
 with a Strength score of 16, the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, the Weapon 
Focus (longsword) feat, and the Weapon Specialization (longsword) feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alcantar has a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack bonus</a> of +7, a Strength <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> of +3, and two longswords, one with +2 enhancement and one masterwork.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If Alcantar chooses to fight with both longswords, he takes a -4 penalty for both his primary and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_offhand')">off hands</a> (see Table 8-10 on page 160 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).
 With the full attack action, he'll get two attacks with his primary 
hand (thanks to his +7 base attack bonus) and one attack with his off 
hand. If he uses the <i>+2 longsword</i> in his primary hand, the 
following bonuses and penalties apply to attacks with primary hand: +3 
Strength, +2 enhancement, +1 weapon focus, -4 two-weapon fighting. The 
base attack bonus for the two attacks will be +7/+2. Alcantar gets his 
full +3 damage bonus from Strength for hits with his primary hand.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If Alcantar uses the masterwork longsword in his off 
hand, the following bonuses and penalties apply to attacks with the off 
hand: +3 Strength, +1 masterwork, +1 weapon focus, -4 two-weapon 
fighting. The base attack bonus for the single attack will be +7, and 
Alcantar gets only half of the +3 damage bonus (rounds down to +1) from 
Strength for hits with his off hand.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The table below shows the attack and damage bonuses for Alcantar's two-weapon attacks:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Attacks and Bonus Damage*</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="300"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td valign="top">Primary hand</td>

<td align="center" valign="top">+8</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">1d8+3</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">*The damage bonus for the weapon in the primary hand is 
+3 Strength, +2 enhancement, and +2 weapon specialization. The damage 
bonus for the weapon in the off hand is +1 Strength (1/2 of +3) and +2 
weapon specialization.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fighting with a One-Handed Weapon and a Light Weapon: </b>Let's<b></b>suppose Alcantar has the same <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilityscore')">ability scores</a>
 and feats as in the previous example, but he decides to use a 
masterwork short sword in his off hand rather than a masterwork 
longsword.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alcantar takes a -2 penalty for both his primary and off
 hands. With the full attack action, he'll get two attacks with the 
longsword in his primary hand and the following bonuses and penalties 
apply: +3 Strength, +2 enhancement, +1 weapon focus, -2 two-weapon 
fighting. The base attack bonus for the two attacks will be +7/+2.</p>
<p align="LEFT">With the masterwork short sword in his off hand, the 
following bonuses and penalties apply: +3 Strength, +1 masterwork, -2 
two-weapon fighting. The base attack bonus for the single attack will be
 +7.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The table below shows the attack and damage bonuses for Alcantar's two-weapon attacks:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Attacks and Bonus Damage*</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="300"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td valign="top">Primary hand</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">*The damage bonus for the weapon in the primary hand is 
+3 Strength, +2 enhancement, and +2 weapon specialization. The damage 
bonus for the weapon in the off hand is +1 Strength (1/2 of +3).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fighting with a Double Weapon: </b>Now let's<b></b>suppose
 Alcantar has the same ability scores as in the first example and the 
following feats: Two-Weapon Fighting, Exotic Weapon Proficiency 
(two-bladed sword), Weapon Focus (two-bladed sword), and Weapon 
Specialization (two-bladed sword).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Let's also assume that Alcantar has a two-bladed sword 
that has one end with a +2 enhancement bonus and one end that's just 
masterwork. The bonuses and penalties when Alcantar attacks with both 
ends of the two-bladed sword are mostly the same as in the previous 
example, except that Alcantar gain the benefits of his Weapon Focus and 
Weapon Specialization for both ends of the weapon. The two-bladed sword 
also deals a little more damage, as shown below:</p>

<p align="LEFT">*The damage bonus for the double weapon's primary end is
 +3 Strength, +2 enhancement, +2 weapon specialization. The damage bonus
 for the double weapon's off-hand end is +1 Strength (1/2 of +3) and +2 
weapon specialization.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Two-Weapon Fighting Miscellany </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Here are a few thoughts on some additional topics related to two-handed fighting.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ways to Maintain Armor Class</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One of the biggest drawbacks to fighting with both hands is the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a> hit you take for giving up a shield. You can compensate for that in several ways.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using an Animated Shield:</b> The animated shield 
property is fairly expensive (equivalent to increasing the enhancement 
bonus by +2), but it frees up both your hands while you still get the 
Armor Class bonus from the shield. Unfortunately, you also get any 
penalties associated with the shield, included the armor check penalty 
that applies to attacks you make in conjunction with the Weapon Finesse 
feat.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 124 of the <i>Player's Handbook:</i></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Buckler:</b> This small metal shield is worn strapped
 to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while 
carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether
 you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a
 two-handed weapon), but you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls while 
doing so because of the extra weight on your arm. This penalty stacks 
with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for 
fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off 
hand, you don't get the buckler's AC bonus for the rest of the round.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can't bash someone with a buckler.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using a Buckler:</b> You can wear a buckler strapped 
to your forearm and use that arm to wield a weapon. That arm could wield
 your off-hand weapon or you can use it to wield a two-handed weapon. 
You take a -1 penalty on attacks you make with the arm where you have 
the buckler (even if it's just one of two hands you use to wield a 
two-handed weapon).</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you attack with the arm bearing the buckler, you 
don't get the Armor Class bonus from the buckler, but at least you gain 
the shield bonus when you aren't attacking. You lose the shield bonus 
from the time you declare the attack with your buckler arm. You don't 
regain the shield bonus until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using a Shield Bash:</b> You can use a light or heavy
 shield (with or without a shield spike) as an off-hand weapon in a 
two-weapon attack. A heavy shield counts as a one-handed weapon. A light
 shield counts as a light weapon. As with a buckler, you lose the 
shield's armor bonus when you make an attack with it. The Improved 
Shield Bash feat, however, allows you to retain the shield's Armor Class
 bonus while you bash with it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using the Two-Weapon Defense Feat:</b> This feat 
gives you a +1 shield bonus to your Armor Class when you wield two 
weapons or a double weapon. You need only hold the weapons or double 
weapon to gain the shield bonus. If you're fighting defensively or using
 the total defense action, the shield bonus from the feat increases to 
+2.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Using the Advanced Two-Weapon Fighting Feats</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Greater Two-Weapon 
Fighting feats allow you extra attacks with your off-hand. Improved 
Two-Weapon Fighting gets you one extra off-hand attack at a -5 penalty. 
Greater Two-Weapon Fighting gets you a third extra off-hand attack at a 
-10 penalty. Here's an example of these two feats in action:</p>
<p align="LEFT">Let's assume our buddy Alcantar is now an 11th-level 
human fighter with a Strength score of 16, and the following feats: 
Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Two-Weapon 
Fighting, Weapon Focus (two-bladed sword), and Weapon Specialization 
(two-bladed sword).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Let's also assume Alcantar has a two-bladed sword with a +2 enhancement bonus at each end.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alcantar has a base attack bonus of +11 and a Strength bonus of +3.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If Alcantar chooses to fight with both ends of his 
two-bladed sword, he takes a -2 penalty for both the primary and 
off-hand ends. With the full attack action, he'll get three attacks with
 the primary end thanks to his +11 base attack bonus (+11/+6/+1), plus 
three with the off-hand end as well (also +11/+6/+1). Thanks to his 
equipment and feats, the following bonuses and penalties apply to both 
hands: +3 Strength, +2 enhancement, +1 weapon focus, -2 two-weapon 
fighting. The table shows the attacks and damage:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Attacks and Bonus Damage*</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0" width="300"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E8E8E8"><td valign="top">Primary hand</td>

<td align="center" valign="top">+15/+10/+5</td>
<td align="center" valign="top"> 1d8+5</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">*The damage bonuses for the primary end are +3 Strength,
 +2 enhancement, and +2 weapon specialization. The damage bonuses for 
the off-hand end are +1 Strength (1/2 of +3), +2 enhancement, and +2 
weapon specialization.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>In Conclusion </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That wraps up our look at two-weapon fighting. Hopefully
 you have an easier time untangling any situations involving two-handed 
combatants and have a few ideas regarding the use of these rules for 
your character.</p>
