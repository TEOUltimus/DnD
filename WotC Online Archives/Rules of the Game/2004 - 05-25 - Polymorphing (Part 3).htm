<p align="LEFT">Part Two covered some fundamental aspects of polymorphing by examining the <i>alter self</i> spell in detail. This time, we'll look at the <i>polymorph</i> spell. As noted in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i><i>polymorph</i> works much like <i>alter self,</i> with a few changes. The <i>polymorph</i> spell allows for a much greater degree of change than <i>alter self</i>, and it also introduces a few new twists and complications. Here's an overview of the <i>polymorph</i> spell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touch range spell with a target entry of "willing living creature touched."</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">You can use <i>polymorph</i> to change yourself or 
another living creature you touch. The creature must be willing to 
receive the spell. The recipient can declare a willing target any time 
(even when flat-footed or during another creature's turn). Unconscious 
creatures are automatically considered willing, but a creature that is 
conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound, cowering, 
grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can share a polymorph effect you cast with a 
familiar, mount, or other companion with the share spells ability, as 
noted in Part Two.</p>
<ul>
<li> You choose the form the subject assumes.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Unlike in earlier versions of the game, the spell allows only one change in form. As with <i>alter self,</i> the subject remains in the assumed form until the spell ends.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The spell is dismissible; if you are the spell caster, 
you can end the spell during your turn with a standard action that does 
not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you place the spell on another 
creature, it cannot dismiss the effect and it must remain in the assumed
 form until the spell ends.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As with <i>alter self,</i> you can't use the <i>polymorph</i> spell to make the subject assume the form of an object. Unlike <i>alter self,</i>
 you can choose almost any kind of living creature for the assumed form.
 You can choose any of the following creature types: aberration, animal,
 dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, 
plant, or vermin.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As with <i>alter self</i>, there's no limit to the subtypes the subject can assume, so long as the base type is on the list given above.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The subject cannot assume an incorporeal or gaseous form.</p>
<ul>
<li> The form the subject assumes can't have Hit Dice of more than your 
caster level, or the subject's own Hit Dice (whichever is lower) to a 
maximum of 15 Hit Dice.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> A form's Hit Dice refers to its racial Hit Dice, as noted in Part Two.</p>
<ul>
<li> The assumed form's size can be anything from Fine to Colossal.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The kind of creature you choose for the assumed form 
determines the size. The subject becomes the same size as an average 
member of its kind. For example, if you turn the subject into a troll, 
the subject becomes size Large, which is the standard size for a troll.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject temporarily gains the type and subtypes of the assumed form.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The subject also temporarily gains the augmented subtype
 for its original type. The subject loses any subtypes it has in favor 
of the assumed form's subtypes. For example, a human turned into a troll
 gains the giant type and the augmented humanoid subtype. The subject 
retains the features of its own type. It gains the traits of the assumed
 type -- except for any extraordinary qualities included in those 
traits. If you're having trouble deciding which type of traits you gain,
 here's a list of what you get and what you don't.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aberration Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with the form's natural weapons. If 
generally humanoid in form, proficient with all simple weapons and any 
weapon the form is described as using.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, 
medium, or heavy) the form is described as wearing, as well as all 
lighter types. Aberrations not indicated as wearing armor are not 
proficient with armor. Aberrations are proficient with shields if they 
are proficient with any form of armor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Aberrations eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Darkvision out to 60 feet. (You don't gain this because it's an extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Air Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually 
have perfect maneuverability. You gain the assumed form's fly speed 
(subject to the limits noted in Part Two) and maneuverability.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Angel Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. (Immunity is a natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison. (Another natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Protective Aura. (Supernatural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Tongues. (Supernatural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Animal Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with natural weapons. A noncombative 
herbivore uses its natural weapons as a secondary attack. Such attacks 
are made with a -5 penalty on the creature's attack rolls, and the 
animal receives only 1/2 its Strength modifier as a damage adjustment. 
(You become proficient with your natural weaponry. You don't forget what
 you know, but most animal forms don't allow you to wield weapons. You 
keep your own mind, but you don't keep your full attack capability when 
you assume the form of a noncombative herbivore because that's a natural
 limitation for the forms. Noncombative herbivores include creatures 
such as domestic cows and sheep.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with no armor unless trained for war. 
(You don't forget what you know, but you don't pick up any armor 
proficiencies. In most cases, any armor you wear will meld into your 
assumed form.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Animals eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an 
Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal). (You usually keep 
your Intelligence score when changing forms; the <i>baleful polymorph </i>spell can be an exception.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Low-light vision. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Alignment: Always neutral. (You usually keep your alignment when changing forms; the <i>baleful polymorph </i>spell can be an exception.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Treasure: None. (You keep your stuff, though chances
 are most things you hold or wear would meld into your form if you 
changed into an animal.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aquatic Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Water creatures always have swim speeds and thus can
 move in water without making Swim checks. You gain the assumed form's 
swim speed (subject to the limits noted in Part Two).</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Archon Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to electricity and petrification. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- +4 racial bonus on saves against poison. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. (Supernatural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon. (Supernatural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Teleport (Su): Archons can use greater teleport at will. (Supernatural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Tongues (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language. (Supernatural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Chaotic Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Any effect that depends on alignment affects a 
creature with this subtype as if the creature has a chaotic alignment, 
no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers 
effects according to its actual alignment (a natural ability).</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage
 reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were 
chaotic-aligned. (Another natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cold Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>--</b> A creature with the cold subtype has immunity 
to cold. It has vulnerability to fire, which means it takes half again 
as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a 
saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure. (A 
natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Construct Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Constructs are not alive, so you usually can't assume a construct form (but see Part Four).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dragon Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with its natural weapons only unless 
humanoid in form (or capable of assuming humanoid form), in which case 
proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its 
entry. (You don't forget what you know, but a change to dragon form 
doesn't get you any weapon proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with no armor. (You don't forget any 
armor proficiencies you know, but most armor you wear will meld into the
 assumed form.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Dragons eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Earth Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Earth creatures usually have burrow speeds, and most
 earth creatures can burrow through solid rock. (You get the assumed 
form's speed, subject to the limits noted in Part Two.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Elemental Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Not subject to critical hits or flanking. (Another natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with natural weapons only, unless 
generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with all simple 
weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry. (You don't forget what 
you know, but a change to elemental form doesn't get you any weapon 
proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, 
medium, or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all 
lighter types. Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not 
proficient with armor. Elementals are proficient with shields if they 
are proficient with any form of armor. (You don't forget what you know, 
but a change to elemental form doesn't get you any armor proficiency 
that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Elementals do not eat, sleep, or breathe. (A natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Darkvision out to 60 feet. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental 
does not have a dual nature -- its soul and body form one unit. When an 
elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to 
their bodies, such as <i>raise dead, reincarnate, </i>and <i>resurrection, </i>don't work on an elemental. It takes a different magical effect, such as <i>limited wish, wish, miracle, </i>or <i>true resurrection, </i>to restore it to life. (If you had a soul before changing, you still have one after changing.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Evil Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Any effect that depends on alignment affects a 
creature with this subtype as if the creature has an evil alignment, no 
matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects
 according to its actual alignment. (A natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage 
reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were 
evil-aligned (Another natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Extraplanar Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You gain this subtype when changing form only when the 
form you assume would have it. The subtype has no traits, but certain 
spells and other magical effects work in special ways against 
extraplanar creatures.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fey Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons 
mentioned in its entry. (You don't forget what you know, but a change to
 fey form doesn't get you any weapon proficiency that's not listed 
here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, 
medium, or heavy) that it is described as wearing, as well as all 
lighter types. Fey not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient 
with armor. Fey are proficient with shields if they are proficient with 
any form of armor. (You don't forget what you know, but a change to fey 
form doesn't get you any armor proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Fey eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Fire Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>

ability.)</p>

<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as

listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, 
medium or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter 
types. Giants not described as wearing armor are not proficient with 
armor. Giants are proficient with shields if they are proficient with 
any form of armor. (You don't forget what you know, but a change to 
giant form doesn't get you any armor proficiency that's not listed 
here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Giants eat, sleep, and breathe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Low-light vision. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Goblinoid Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Good Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Any effect that depends on alignment affects a 
creature with this subtype as if the creature has a good alignment, no

doesn't get you any weapon proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, 
medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class. If a

that type of armor and all lighter types. Humanoids not indicated as

with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor. (You don't

<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Native Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong 
connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or

<p align="LEFT"> -- Blind, with immunity to gaze attacks, visual 
effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. (Natural 
ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Not subject to critical hits or flanking. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with its natural weapons only. (You don't
 forget what you know, but a change to ooze form doesn't get you any 
armor proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with no armor. (You don't forget what you
 know, but a change to ooze form doesn't get you any armor proficiency. 
Most armor you wear melds into your assumed form.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Oozes eat and breathe, but do not sleep.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Mindless: No Intelligence score, and immunity to all
 mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and 
morale effects). (You usually keep your Intelligence score when changing
 forms; the <i>baleful polymorph </i>spell can be an exception.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Blindsight (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Some oozes have the ability to deal acid damage to 
objects. In such a case, the amount of damage is equal to 10 + 1/2 
ooze's HD + ooze's Constitution modifier per full round of contact.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Outsider Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with all simple and martial weapons and 
any weapons mentioned in its entry. (You don't forget what you know, but
 a change to outsider form doesn't get you any weapon proficiency that's
 not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, 
medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter 
types. Outsiders not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with 
armor. Outsiders are proficient with shields if they are proficient with
 any form of armor. (You don't forget what you know, but a change to 
outsider form doesn't get you any armor proficiency that's not listed 
here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Outsiders breathe, but do not need to eat or sleep 
(although they can do so if they wish). Native outsiders breathe, eat, 
and sleep. (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Darkvision out to 60 feet. (Extraordinary special quality.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Unlike most other living creatures, an outsider does
 not have a dual nature -- its soul and body form one unit. When an 
outsider is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to 
their bodies, such as <i>raise dead, reincarnate, </i>and <i>resurrection, </i>don't work on an outsider. It takes a different magical effect, such as <i>limited wish, wish, miracle, </i>or <i>true resurrection </i>to
 restore it to life. An outsider with the native subtype can be raised, 
reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. (If 
you had a soul before changing, you still have one after changing.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Plant Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). (Natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning. (Another natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Not subject to critical hits. (Another natural ability.)</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Reptilian Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> This subtype has no traits; it merely designates certain kinds of humanoids.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shapechanger Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with the natural weapons, with simple 
weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creature's description. 
(You don't forget what you know, but a change to shapechanger form 
doesn't get you any weapon proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with any armor mentioned in the 
creature's description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of 
armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A 
shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with any 
type of armor. (You don't forget what you know, but a change to 
shapechanger form doesn't get you any armor proficiency that's not 
listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Swarm Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You can't become a swarm by changing form.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Undead Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Undead creatures are not alive, so you usually can't assume an undead form (but see Part Four).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vermin Type</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with their natural weapons only. (You 
don't forget what you know, but a change to vermin form doesn't get you 
any weapon proficiency that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Proficient with no armor. (You don't forget what you
 know, but a change to vermin form doesn't get you any armor proficiency
 that's not listed here.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">-- Vermin breathe, eat, and sleep.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You don't get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"> -- Mindless: No Intelligence score and immunity to all 
mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and 
morale effects). (You usually keep your Intelligence score when changing
 forms; the <i>baleful polymorph </i>spell can be an exception.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">-- Darkvision out to 60 feet. (A natural ability.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Water Subtype</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You get the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT">-- Creatures with the water subtype always have swim 
speeds and can move in water without making Swim checks. A water 
creature can breathe underwater and usually can breathe air as well. You
 gain the assumed form's swim speed (subject to the limits noted in Part
 Two).</p>
<ul>
<li> Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The subject regains 1 hit point per character level. 
Character level includes racial Hit Dice and all class levels. The 
subject does not heal any temporary ability damage or get any other 
benefits of resting. Changing back does not heal the subject further. If
 slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains 
dead.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores 
of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 
scores.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The subject retains its own mind, but its body is 
transformed into a semblance of the assumed form. Unlike previous 
versions of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, the subject's hit points change 
according to his new Constitution score. The subject's Strength, 
Dexterity, and Constitution scores revert to normal when resuming its 
normal form, which may prompt another change in hit points.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A change in ability scores might render some of the 
subject's feats unusable. If a feat has an ability score prerequisite 
that the subject no longer meets, the subject still has the feat, but 
cannot use it so long as the prerequisite is not met. If the subject has
 a prestige class that depends on an unusable feat, the subject cannot 
use any features of the class but retains any Hit Dice, base attack, and
 base save bonuses from the class and also retains weapon and armor 
proficiencies from the class.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject's class and level, alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses remain unchanged in the assumed form.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> As noted in Part Two, the subject also retains all 
class features, as well as all skill ranks and feats derived from class 
levels.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject retains the supernatural and spell-like special attacks
 and qualities of its normal form, except for those requiring a body 
part that the new form does not have.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> As noted in Part One, the subject loses breath weapons 
if the assumed form doesn't have a mouth and loses gaze attacks if the 
assumed form doesn't have eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject retains all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from class levels.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> As noted in Part One, extraordinary special attacks or qualities from class levels are primarily a function of the mind.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject loses extraordinary special attacks and qualities not derived from class levels.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> Also as noted in Part One, extraordinary special attacks and qualities are assumed to be largely a function of the body.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject retains its ability to speak if the assumed form has that ability, as noted in Part Two.<br><br></li>
<li> The subject gains all extraordinary attacks of the assumed form, 
but no supernatural or spell-like attacks. The subject gains no special 
qualities of the assumed form at all.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> As noted in Part One, extraordinary special attacks 
derive largely from the physical body, while extraordinary special 
qualities prove more subtle.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject retains spellcasting abilities, if any, just as noted in Part Two.<br><br></li>
<li>The subject has the physical qualities of the assumed form as noted in Part Two.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> Physical qualities include modes of breathing as well 
as modes of movement. If the assumed form has gills but no lungs it can 
breathe underwater but it cannot breathe out of the water and will begin
 to suffocate if stranded on dry land.</p>
<ul>
<li> The subject cannot take the form of any creature with a template, just as with the <i>alter self</i> spell.<br><br></li>
<li> You can freely designate the assumed form's minor physical 
qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the 
normal ranges for a creature of that kind, just as with the <i>alter self</i> spell.<br><br></li>
<li> The subject is effectively disguised as an average member of the assumed form's race, as noted in Part Two.<br><br></li>
<li>When the change occurs, the subject's equipment, if any, either 
remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or 
holding the item), or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">For purposes of most polymorph effects, one can divide 
creatures into types that have basically humanoid shapes and those that 
do not, as follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="308"><tbody><tr><td width="142"><b>Humanoid Shapes</b></td>
<td width="150"><b>Nonhumanoid Shapes</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td width="142">Fey</td>
<td width="150">Aberration</td>
</tr>
<tr><td width="142">Giant</td>
<td width="150">Animal</td>
</tr>
<tr><td width="142">Humanoid</td>
<td width="150">Dragon</td>

</tr>
<tr><td width="142"></td>
<td width="150">Vermin</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">*Most, but not all outsiders have humanoid shapes.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">In general, a change from one form that has a humanoid 
shape to another form that has a humanoid shape leaves all equipment in 
place and functioning. The subject's equipment changes to match the 
assumed form. It becomes the appropriate size for the assumed form and 
it fits the assumed form. The spellcaster can change minor details in 
your equipment, such as color, surface texture, and decoration.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a subject changes from a form with a humanoid shape
 to a form with a nonhumanoid shape (or vice versa) most of his 
equipment is subsumed into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. Items
 the subject could conceivably wear in an assumed form remain 
functional. For example, most items worn on the body, such as armor, 
cloaks, boots, and most other items of clothing made for a humanoid body
 won't fit on a nonhumanoid body. Some items can fit on just about any 
kind of body. For example, a ring fits just about any form that has 
digits of some kind (the limit of two rings applies no matter how many 
hands or similar appendages a creature has). Likewise, a necklace fits 
on just about any form that has a neck.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>A <i>Polymorph </i>Example</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">
</p><p align="LEFT">Our friend Anlion (from Part Two) is now an 8th-level sorcerer. Let's see what happens when he uses a <i>polymorph</i> spell to assume the forms of a lizardfolk and a troll.</p><b>Anlion (Normal Form):</b>
 Male half-elf sorcerer 8; CR 8; Medium humanoid; HD 8d4; hp 20; Init 
+2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 14, touch 13, flat-footed 12; Base Atk +4; Grp +3; 
Atk +3 melee (1d6-1, quarterstaff) or +7 ranged (1d8/19-20, masterwork 
light crossbow); Full Atk +3 melee (1d6-1, quarterstaff) or +7 ranged 
(1d8/19-20, masterwork light crossbow); SQ half-elf traits, low-light 
vision; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +6, Will +8; Str 8, Dex 14, Con 11, Int 
12, Wis 10, Cha 17. <p></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Bluff +11, Concentration +9, 
Diplomacy +7, Gather Information +5, Intimidate +5, Knowledge (arcana) 
+9, Listen +1, Search +2, Spellcraft +11, Spot +1; Dodge, Empower Spell,
 Extend Spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Half-Elf Traits:</b> Anlion is immune to magic sleep 
spells and effects, and he has elven blood (for all effects related to 
race, he is considered an elf). Anlion also has a +2 racial bonus on 
saves against enchantment spells or effects, a +1 racial bonus on 
Listen, Spot, and Search checks, and a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and 
Gather Information checks (already figured into the statistics given 
above).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/7/7/6/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 -- <i>arcane mark, daze, detect magic, flare, light, mage hand, prestidigitation, resistance;</i> 1st -- <i>burning hands, color spray, magic missile, shield, true strike;</i> 2nd -- <i>alter self, scorching ray, see invisibility; </i>3rd -- <i>fly, lightning bolt;</i> 4th -- <i>polymorph. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Possessions:</i><i>Bracers of armor +1, ring of protection +1, cloak of resistance +2,</i> quarterstaff, masterwork light crossbow, 10 bolts, <i>potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of invisibility, </i>2 scrolls of<i> eagle's splendor, wand of magic missile </i>(3rd-level caster, 48 charges)<i>.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">In lizardfolk form, Anlion's statistics change 
significantly. He gains the lizardfolk's natural armor, natural 
weaponry, and racial skill bonuses; he also gains the Strength, 
Dexterity, and Constitution scores of a typical lizardfolk (as noted in 
the <i>Monster Manual</i>). The ability score changes give him a few 
more hit points and improve his melee combat abilities, but his reduced 
Dexterity score makes his Dodge feat unusable. He loses his low-light 
vision (an extraordinary special quality). He retains his half-elf 
racial skill bonuses. He gains the lizardfolk's racial skill bonuses to 
Balance, Jump, and Swim checks, and the lizardfolk's natural ability to 
hold its breath. He loses his half-elf subtype and gains the reptilian 
subtype. His equipment keeps functioning in his assumed form (because 
it's another humanoid form).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Anlion (Lizardfolk Form):</b> Male half-elf sorcerer 
8; CR 8; Medium humanoid (reptilian); HD 8d4+8; hp 28; Init +0; Spd 30 
ft.; AC 17, touch 11, flat-footed 17; Base Atk +4; Grp +5; Atk +5 melee 
(1d4+1, claw) or +5 melee (1d6+1, quarterstaff) or +5 ranged (1d8/19-20,
 masterwork light crossbow); Full Atk +5 melee (1d4+1, 2 claws) and +0 
melee (1d4, bite) or +5 melee (1d6+1, quarterstaff) and +0 melee (1d4, 
bite) or +5 ranged (1d8/19-20, masterwork light crossbow); SQ hold

Jump +5, Knowledge (arcana) +9, Listen +1, Search +2, Spellcraft +11, 
Spot +1, Swim +5; Dodge (unavailable due to reduction in Dexterity 
score), Empower Spell, Extend Spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hold Breath:</b> Anlion can hold his breath for 52 rounds before he risks drowning. (This is a natural ability for a lizardfolk.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Sorcerer Spells Known</b> (6/7/7/6/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 -- <i>arcane mark, daze, detect magic, flare, light, mage hand, prestidigitation, resistance;</i> 1st -- <i>burning hands, color spray, magic missile, shield, true strike; </i>2nd -- <i>alter self, scorching ray, see invisibility; </i>3rd -- <i>fly, lightning bolt;</i> 4th -- <i>polymorph.</i></p>

<p align="LEFT">In troll form, Anlion's statistics change dramatically. 
He gains the troll's natural armor, natural weaponry, and the troll's 
deadly rend attack; he also gains the Strength, Dexterity, and 
Constitution scores of a typical troll (as noted in the <i>Monster Manual</i>).
 The ability score changes give him many more hit points and improve his
 melee combat abilities. He loses his low-light vision (an extraordinary
 special quality). He retains his half-elf racial skill bonuses. He does
 not gain the troll's darkvision or regeneration abilities (also 
extraordinary special qualities). He gains the giant type, loses his 
half-elf subtype, and gains the augmented humanoid subtype. His 
equipment keeps functioning in his assumed form because a giant has a 
basically humanoid body. He gains the troll's Large size, which 
increases his space and reach and affects his combat abilities -- 
particularly his grapple bonus. Because his equipment remains 
functional, it changes size along with him.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Anlion (Troll Form):</b> Male half-elf sorcerer 8; CR
 8; Large giant (augmented humanoid); HD 8d4+48; hp 68; Init +2; Spd 30

+4 melee (1d6+3, bite) or +6 ranged (1d8/19-20, masterwork light

<p align="LEFT"><b>Rend (Ex):</b> If Anlion hits with both claw attacks,
 he latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack 
automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.</p>
