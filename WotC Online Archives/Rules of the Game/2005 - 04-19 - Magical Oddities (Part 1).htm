<p align="left">Magic plays a central role in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game. It provides an essential dose of the fantastic for any campaign. Most players and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DMs</a>
 agree that magic is fun; unfortunately magic also proves inscrutable or
 even illogical, and arguments about magic and how it works have brought
 many a game to a standstill. This series explores the <b>D&amp;D</b> game's singular approach to magic. This week, we'll consider some of the principles underlying <b>D&amp;D</b> magic and take a look a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> and spell preparation.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Magical Basics </b></p>
<p align="left">The rules don't include a formal definition of magic; however, when the <b>D&amp;D</b> core rules (<i>Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide</i> and <i>Monster Manual</i>)
 discuss magic, they refer to some force or effect that somehow 
transcends the natural laws that govern the real world. Magic works its 
wonders in <b>D&amp;D</b> without any discernable physical cause and often without any rational explanation. <b>D&amp;D</b>
 magic involves tapping into some kind of mysterious force or power 
source and shaping it into some kind of effect that the magic wielder 
finds useful. Characters most often do so through spellcasting (see the 
next section).</p>
<p align="left">Magic in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game follows its own logic, 
and a magical effect most often works more like a legal contract than a 
physical law. A magical effect in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game has a 
description that defines exactly how it works in the game. This approach
 has its advantages for a roleplaying game, and perhaps the most 
important of these is that an effect's description limits its power and 
impact on the game world, which helps keep magic wielders from 
completely dominating the game. It also allows players and DMs to be 
reasonably sure how any particular magical effect functions in the 
context of the game, and that eliminates a lot of arguments and 
guesswork.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Ins and Outs of Spells</b></p>
<p align="left">Spells represent the form of magic most readily available to player characters in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game. The rules define a spell as a one-time magical effect that 
usually must be carefully prepared ahead of time by studying a book of 
spells (the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_wizard')">wizard's</a> approach to spells) or petitioning a divine power (the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cleric')">cleric's</a> method). Spells in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game come in two varieties: <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_arcanespell')">arcane</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_divinespell')">divine</a>.
 Arcane spells are generally more versatile and potent than divine 
spells, but they can prove more difficult to cast (see Part Three).</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Basics of Spell Preparation</b></p>
<p align="left">The act of preparing a spell is the first step of 
gathering and shaping raw magical power into a useful effect. Earlier 
versions of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game treated preparing a spell much like 
committing something to memory. Once a spell was "memorized," it was 
ready to cast. The act of spellcasting wiped the spell from the caster's
 memory. In the present version of the game, preparing a spell is the 
first step of casting the spell, and it is the most difficult and 
time-consuming part of the casting. Once a spell has been prepared, the 
spellcaster holds the spell's potential in her mind (or body) and needs 
only a moment of concentration (usually along with a few words, 
gestures, and materials) to complete the spell and release its effects. 
Once cast, a spell's potential is used up, though a spellcaster can 
prepare the same spell more than once.</p>
<p align="left">The rules governing spell preparation are fairly straightforward. Chapter 10 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> explains spell preparation in considerable detail. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li> Spellcasters have limited number of spells they can use each day, as shown in the table of features for the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_class')">class</a>. For <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">characters</a>
 who prepare spells, DMs may find it best to enforce the limit by 
restricting the character to one session of spell preparation each day 
(though the character doesn't have to prepare those spells all at once; 
see the section on delayed spell preparation).<br><br> The act of spell preparation is what makes the character's daily allotment of spells available for use.<br><br></li>
<li>A wizard (and most other arcane spellcasters who prepare spells) must first sleep for 8 hours to clear the mind.<br><br>
 The spellcaster doesn't have to sleep for every moment of that time, 
but the character must rest quietly when not asleep. If the character 
does not need to sleep for some reason, she still must have 8 hours of 
restful calm before preparing any spells. For example, an elf does not 
sleep, but instead enters a trance for 4 hours. An elf wizard still must
 rest for the full 8 hours before preparing any spells.<br><br> A 
character is not sleeping or resting quietly when walking around, 
running, or using any other form of movement. Combat, spellcasting, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skill')">skill</a>
 use, conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental 
task also precludes rest. Such tasks might include breaking down a door,
 lifting a heavy object, reading, or writing.<br><br> If something 
interrupts the spellcaster's rest, all is not lost. Instead, each 
interruption extends the required rest period by 1 hour. Deciding what 
constitutes an interruption usually isn't too hard. If the character 
chooses to do something (or is forced to do something) that precludes 
rest, then the character's rest is interrupted. Deciding when one 
interruption ends and the next one begins can prove a little tougher. 
Here are a few useful rules of thumb: A single interruption lasts until 
the character tries to begin resting again. If an interruption lasts an 
hour or more, it's best to assume the character has abandoned his 
current attempt at rest.<br><br> No matter how often a character stops 
and resumes resting, the character must have a full hour's uninterrupted
 rest immediately prior to preparing spells.<br><br></li>
<li> Most divine spellcasters don't need to rest before preparing 
spells. Instead, they must prepare spells at a certain time of day. See 
pages 179-180 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and Rules of the Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050329a">All About Clerics</a> for details.<br><br></li>
<li>A character's ability to prepare spells is diminished when the character has cast any spells just prior to spell preparation.<br><br>
 When a character begins preparing spells for the day, any spells she 
has cast during the past 8 hours count against the number of spells the 
character can prepare and cast. See page 178 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for an example.<br><br>
 Here's another example of the recent casting rule: Harold, a 1st-level 
wizard who specializes in evocation magic, has a basic daily spell 
allotment of three 0-level spells and one 1st-level spell (see Table 
3-17 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). Harold gains an extra 1st-level 
evocation spell for being a specialist and also gains a bonus 1st-level 
spell for Intelligence. The additions make three 0-level spells and 
three 1st-level spells available to Harold each day.<br><br> Harold goes
 to sleep at 10 PM one evening and plans to rise 8 hours later (at 6 AM 
the following morning) to prepare spells. At 5:35 AM, however, a horde 
of goblins assaults the character's camp and Harold dispatches their 
leader with a <i>magic missile</i> spell. All is well after the attack, 
which is over in about 10 minutes (including some time to search the 
surrounding area for any additional goblins). Harold gets back to bed by
 5:45; he will have to rest for an extra hour because of the 
interruption to his rest. The earliest he can begin preparing spells 
this day is 7:00 AM (his original wake-up time plus 1 hour). Assuming no
 further interruptions, Harold will be ready to prepare spells at 7:00 
AM, however, he can prepare only two extra spells at that time because 
he had cast a 1st-level spell at 5:35 AM, which was within 8 hours of 
his spell preparation time.</li>
</ul>
