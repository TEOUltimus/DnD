<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion Basics: </b>Use the base statistics for a creature of the companion's kind, as given in the <i>Monster Manual, </i>but make the following changes.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Class Level: </i>The character's druid level. The 
druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are 
entitled to an animal companion (such as the ranger) for the purpose of 
determining the companion's abilities and the alternative lists 
available to the character.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Bonus HD: </i>Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each 
of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra 
Hit Dice improve the animal companion's base attack and base save 
bonuses. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a
 druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. An animal companion has good
 Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals 
the animal's HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and 
feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster's Hit Dice (see the
 <i>Monster Manual</i>).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Natural Armor Adj.: </i>The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Str/Dex Adj.: </i>Add this value to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Bonus Tricks: </i>The value given in this column is 
the total number of "bonus" tricks that the animal knows in addition to 
any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal 
skill, page 74). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or 
Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of 
tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and 
once selected, they can't be changed.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Link (Ex): </i>A druid can handle her animal 
companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she 
doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 
circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks 
made regarding an animal companion.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex): </i>At the druid's option, she may
 have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself 
also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 
feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell 
or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting 
the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and
 will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid 
before the duration expires. Additionally, the druid may cast a spell 
with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) 
instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells
 even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's 
type (animal).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Evasion (Ex): </i>If an animal companion is subjected
 to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Devotion (Ex): </i>An animal companion's devotion to 
its master is so complete that it gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves 
against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Multiattack: </i>An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks (see the <i>Monster Manual </i>for
 details on this feat) and does not already have that feat. If it does 
not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal 
companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon,
 albeit at a -5 penalty.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Improved Evasion (Ex): </i>When subjected to an 
attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an 
animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw 
and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Animal Companion Basics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The animal companion class feature gives you an animal 
to serve you and accompany you on your adventures. The animal is pretty 
much just like any other creature of its kind, but its status as an 
animal companion gives it several exceptional features and traits.</p>
<ul>
<li> The sidebar on page 36 in the<i> Player's Handbook</i> shows potential animal companions and their special abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_class')">class</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_classlevel')">class level</a>
 determines the kind of animal you can choose, as shown in your class 
description. Some animal companion traits, however, remain the same no 
matter what your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_level')">level</a>. Here's an overview:</p>
<p align="LEFT">An animal companion remains an animal.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Early versions of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> said that
 animal companions become magical beasts. According to the errata files,
 however, animal companions are merely animals.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can handle your animal companion as a free <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a>, and you do it very well.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The link special ability, which is available to anyone 
who has an animal companion, allows you to give your animal a command as
 a free action if you order it to use a trick it knows. You can push 
your companion (see Part One) as a move action. You also gain a +4 
circumstance <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a>
 on any Handle Animal or wild empathy check you make regarding your 
animal companion. Otherwise, commanding an animal companion works just 
like commanding a trained animal, as described in Part One.</p>
<ul>
<li> You can share <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> with your animal companion.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> You decide when spells are shared. To share a spell, 
you must cast the spell and you must select yourself as its target. The 
spell must have a target entry; you cannot share effect and area spells.
 See <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a"><i>Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</i></a> for a discussion of targets, effects, and areas. You can't share a spell with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_touchspell')">touch</a> range unless you target yourself with the touch.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You and your animal companion can share a spell even if
 the spell normally does not affect animals. The shared spell does not 
have to be a divine spell; you can share any spell you cast yourself 
with your animal companion. You cannot share spell-like abilities or 
supernatural abilities, even if you can target them on yourself. You and
 your animal companion can share effects from magic items only if the 
effect is a spell that you can target on yourself. For example, you and 
your animal companion can share a <i>barkskin</i> spell cast from a wand, but cannot share the armor bonus from <i>bracers of armor</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To share a spell, your animal companion must be within 5
 feet of you and there must be an unbroken line of effect between you 
and the companion. If the shared spell has a duration other than 
instantaneous, your animal companion must remain with 5 feet of you and 
maintain an unbroken line of effect to you or lose the spell's benefits.
 Once your animal companion loses the benefits from a particular casting
 of a spell, it cannot regain them again.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When you and your animal companion share a spell, you're
 effectively adding one free target (your animal companion) to the 
spell's effect. In simple cases, the spell just affects both of you in 
the same way. For example, when you share a <i>cure light wounds </i>spell
 with your animal companion, the spell provides healing equal to 1d8 + 
your caster level for both you and for your animal companion. A shared <i>spider climb</i> spell gives both you and your animal companion the power to climb sheer, smooth surfaces. A shared <i>protection from energy </i>spell provides a separate ablative shield against the chosen energy type to you and to your animal companion.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some spells don't work quite as simply as these, but the
 effect of sharing them with your animal companion is usually pretty 
intuitive. For example, if you cast <i>word of recall,</i> your animal 
companion doesn't count toward the limit of transported creatures 
(regardless of its size). Likewise, if you share a <i>transport via plants</i> spell with your animal companion, the companion doesn't count toward the spell's weight limit. If you share a <i>water breathing</i>
 spell with your animal companion, the companion gains the same duration
 of effect as you do, but it isn't counted as one of the creatures 
touched for the purpose of dividing the total duration.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some spells require special handling when shared. See <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040511a">Rules of the Game: All About Polymorph</a></i> for an example.</p>
<p align="LEFT"> You also have the option of casting any spell with a 
target of "you" on your animal companion as a spell with touch range. If
 you do so, you do not share the effect with the companion, but your 
animal companion retains the spell's benefits for as long as the spell 
lasts no matter where the companion goes after you cast the spell.</p>
<ul>
<li> The animal companion learns a bonus trick.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">You don't have to make a check or spend any time 
training the companion. Once you select the bonus trick, you cannot 
change it later.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Level-Based Benefits</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">An animal companion gains several traits that depend on 
your level in the class that gives you the companion. If you have more 
than one class that can give you an animal companion, add your class 
levels together to determine what animals are available to you as animal
 companions and what your animal companion's abilities are. (You don't 
gain an animal companion for each class.) You might not be able to add 
all your class levels together to generate an animal companion. For 
example, the ranger's animal companion class feature uses the same 
particulars as the druid's animal companion class feature, but the 
ranger's effective class level for his animal companion is only one half
 his ranger level. A druid/ranger uses his druid level plus one half his
 ranger level for all his animal companion's level-related variables.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Here's an overview of an animal companion's level-based benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li> Bonus <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDie')">Hit Dice</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The animal companion gains extra Hit Dice as noted in the table on page 36 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> The companion gains the full benefit from increased Hit Dice, including increased <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_basesavebonus')">base saves</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillpoints')">skill points</a>, and feats. The animal companion, however, does not increase in <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_size')">size</a> (any more than you do when adding Hit Dice for your class levels).</p>
<ul>
<li> Natural armor increase.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Add the value shown on the table to the companion's 
normal natural armor bonus. For example, a standard wolf's natural armor
 bonus is +2. A wolf animal companion with a 5th-level master has a 
natural armor bonus of +4.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This trait doesn't simply provide an extra natural armor
 bonus, it actually improves the companion's racial natural armor bonus.
 Additional natural armor bonuses from items or spells, such as <i>amulets of natural armor</i> or <i>barkskin</i> spells stack with the natural armor bonus from this trait, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The natural armor bonus from this trait increases with 
your level, as shown on the table. The companion gets the benefit of 
this trait for as long as it remains a companion.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> increases.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Add the value shown on the table to the companion's 
Strength and Dexterity scores. For example, a standard wolf has a 
Strength score of 13 and a Dexterity score of 15. A wolf animal 
companion with a 5th-level master has a Strength score of 14 and a 
Dexterity score of 16.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As with natural armor, this is an outright increase to Strength and Dexterity, not a bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li> Bonus tricks.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The animal companion learns additional tricks. As noted
 earlier, you don't need to teach your companion its bonus tricks. Once 
you choose a bonus trick, you cannot change it.</p>
<ul>
<li> Evasion.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> If your effective class level for the animal companion 
class feature is at least 3rd (for example, you are a 3rd-level druid or
 a 6th-level ranger), your animal companion gains the evasion special 
quality. If the companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows
 a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Reflexsave')">Reflex saving throw</a> for half <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>, the companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<ul>
<li> Devotion.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">If your effective class level for the animal companion 
class feature is at least 6th, your animal companion gains a +4 morale 
bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Essentially, your animal companion becomes so devoted to
 you that others have a hard time establishing mental control over the 
companion.</p>
<ul>
<li> Multiattack.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">If your effective class level for the animal companion 
class feature is at least 9th, your animal companion gains Multiattack 
as a bonus feat if it doesn't already have it. The companion must have 
three or more natural weapons (for example, two claws and a bite) to 
gain Multiattack. If the companion does not have the requisite three 
natural weapons, it instead gains a second natural attack with its 
primary natural weapon at a -5 penalty. The companion must use the full 
attack action to get the second attack (just as it must to use more than
 one natural weapon).</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, a wolf animal companion with a 9th-level 
master has 8 Hit Dice (2 racial Hit Dice and 6 bonus Hit Dice), a base 
attack bonus of +6, and a Strength score of 16 (base 13 increased by 3).
 The wolf companion attack bonus with its bite is +9 (+6 base, +3 
Strength). Because a wolf has only one natural weapon (its bite), the 
wolf gains a second bite attack when it uses the full attack action. The
 attack bonus for this second attack is +4 (9 - 5).</p>
<ul>
<li> Improved evasion.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">If your effective class level for the animal companion 
class feature is at least 15th, your animal companion gains the improved
 evasion special quality. If the companion is subjected to an attack 
that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, the animal 
takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage 
even if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Acquiring an Animal Companion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The rules speak of a ceremony to gain an animal 
companion, but they do not go into much detail about the process other 
than noting that the ceremony takes 24 hours of uninterrupted prayer. 
Here are a few thoughts to flesh out the process.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An animal companion is not a conjured creature and is not subject to effects, such as <i>protection from evil</i> or <i>dismissal,</i>
 that banish or hedge out conjured creatures. Think of it as binding an 
animal companion rather than summoning it. To begin, you must first 
locate the kind of creature you desire. The prospective companion cannot
 be an advanced animal, nor can it be another character's animal 
companion or another character's familiar. It also can't have a 
template, even if that template doesn't change its type. Awakened 
animals can never serve as animal companions. The animal you choose must
 be of a kind your class makes available to you as an animal companion.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can use any convenient means to locate your intended
 companion. Because most animal companions aren't the kind you can find 
in a shop, finding the animal you want probably requires a trip into the
 wild and a few Survival or Knowledge (nature) checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">After locating the companion, you must arrange to keep 
the animal nearby for the day-long ritual that binds the two of you 
together. Lucky masters choose companions that are friendly enough to 
stick around on their own , but sometimes you must tether or cage it to 
keep it from wandering off.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The ritual does not succeed unless the intended 
companion is friendly toward you (but a wild empathy check can solve 
that problem). The ritual also does not succeed if the intended 
companion is under any charm or compulsion effect.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You can have only one animal companion at a time and an 
animal can have only one master at time. You can, however, have both an 
animal companion and a familiar if your class levels give you both class
 features.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The ritual itself can take any form the DM desires; 
however, a few gestures, chants, and perhaps some drawings sketched on 
the floor around the pair of you -- all repeated at intervals throughout
 the day -- are all that are necessary.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dismissing an Animal Companion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes, a character may want to rid herself of an 
animal companion, usually because the companion has suffered some 
debilitating injury or because a more desirable animal becomes available
 as a companion. To dismiss an animal companion, you simply will it so, 
though breaking the link that binds the two of you is a full-round 
action.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You suffer no penalties for dismissing an animal 
companion (other than the necessity of finding and binding a new animal 
companion). Immediately on being dismissed, the animal loses all animal 
companion abilities and becomes a normal creature of its kind. It 
suffers no other ill effects. You are free to bind a new animal 
companion as soon as you have the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Death of an Animal Companion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When an animal companion dies, the master doesn't suffer
 any penalties beyond the loss of the companion and she can bind a new 
one right away, as noted above.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Bringing back the animal from the dead reestablishes the
 link between the two of you, and you need not locate or bind a new 
companion; however, the <i>reincarnate</i> spell is an exception. The 
spell brings back the animal as an independent being and the resulting 
creature is no longer an animal companion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Death of a Master</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you die, and your animal companion survives, it is 
effectively dismissed. As a house rule, you might want to delay the 
companion's loss of abilities for a short time, say one day for each 
character level you have.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you are later brought back from the dead, the link 
between you and your surviving animal companion is reestablished 
automatically.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Animal Companions and Magic Items</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A great way to both protect your companion and perhaps 
give it some offensive power is to equip it with magic items. Consider 
purchasing items for your companion or just give it items you no longer 
need (such as your <i>+1 ring of protection</i> when you acquire a <i>+2 ring of protection</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once you do so, however, you and your DM face a 
potentially difficult decision. Exactly which items can animals use? 
Since most magic items fit users of any size, the simple answer is this:
 pretty much any item. No animal companion can use an item that requires
 spell completion or spell knowledge because they are not spellcasters. 
Likewise animals cannot speak, so they can't use command word items. 
Animals also lack weapon proficiencies and prehensile appendages, so 
they cannot employ weapons, either. That leaves us with the following: 
potions (though you may have to open the potion vial and pour out the 
liquid), rings, and most items that can be worn or carried. Your DM may 
decide that your companion's body type simply does not allow some items 
to fit your companion. For example, you might persuade your DM to let 
your wolf wear boots, but don't count on your snake wearing boots. 
Creatures like owls and hawks may have a hard time with cloaks (since 
the garment interferes with their wings).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Other than the exceptions noted here, all animals have 
locations for magic items similar to those noted for characters on page 
214 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i> For example, a quadruped uses 
its back feet for the "foot" location and its front feet for the "hand" 
location. The hind legs correspond to a humanoid's legs and the front 
legs correspond to a humanoid's arms.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For avians, treat the feet and legs as hands and arms, 
and the wings as legs and feet. The creature can wear "leg" items on its
 wings or hind legs, but not both.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A snake simply wears items over its head or body.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In most cases, even if your companion can't use an item 
you've found, it should be possible to make (or have made) an item it 
can use. For example, you might fashion <i>wing bands of speed</i> for your owl's or hawk's wings, and they would work just like <i>boots of speed </i>for your companion.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For an in-depth look at what items an animal can use or wear, check out <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/re/20031125a">Wild Life</a>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Animal Companions as Beings</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Other than the special traits noted earlier, an animal 
companion acts just like a well-trained loyal animal, no smarter or more
 capable than any other creature of its kind (except for the 
improvements your class levels bring). An animal companion identity is 
strongly linked to you, however, and the two of you form a sort of dual 
being. The animal companion cannot gain <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_experiencepoints')">experience</a> or add any class levels on its own.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Likewise, an animal companion is an extension of you, 
and you and your companion do not split or share any experience points 
you earn even when the companion helps you earn that experience.</p>
<p align="left"><b>In Conclusion </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That wraps up our look at animals. I hope that you find 
the material on this topic helpful when you next sit down at the gaming 
table.</p>
