<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Charms</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, charm <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> grant the caster some degree of control over the subject. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_charmsubschool')">Charms</a>
 tend to be the most troublesome enchantments because arguments arise 
over the extent of the control the spell provides, especially when a 
player character falls victim to a charm spell. Fortunately, a quick 
review of the spell description usually proves sufficient to establish 
what the spell can do.</p>
<p align="left">When a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player character</a>
 falls victim to a charm and the player finds it hard to cooperate to 
the extent that the spell requires, it's usually best for the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DM</a>
 to point out a course of action for the character that properly 
reflects the enchantment. If the player continues to balk, the DM should
 to step in and treat the character as an NPC for a short time.</p>

<p align="left"><i><b>Charm Person:</b></i> The quintessential charm spell, <i>charm person</i> makes the target <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creature</a> friendly to the caster. According to the sidebar on page 72 of the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> a friendly creature wishes you well and will chat with you, advise you, offer you limited help, and act as your advocate.</p>
<p align="left">In general, a <i>charmed</i> (or otherwise friendly) 
person might be expected to be roughly as accommodating to you as a 
co-worker that trusts you and gets along well with you or as obliging as
 an old school chum. You shouldn't expect a <i>charmed</i> character to make any truly painful or costly sacrifices for you.</p>
<p align="left">You have a limited ability to persuade a <i>charmed</i> creature to go out on a limb for you when the consequences to the <i>charmed</i>
 creature aren't immediately obvious. The spell description uses holding
 off a red dragon while you escape as an example (and that works only 
when the <i>charmed</i> subject is a fighter type with appropriate equipment). For more suggestions on handling charms, see <i>Save My Game: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20050812a">Adjudicating Charm Spells</a></i></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 209 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Charm Person</b></p>
<p align="left">Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Target:</b> One humanoid creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance: </b>Yes</p>
<p align="left">This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its 
trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly; see 
Influencing NPC Attitudes, page 72). If the creature is currently being 
threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 
bonus on its saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">The spell does not enable you to control the <i>charmed </i>person
 as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in 
the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you 
must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it 
wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature 
never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but a <i>charmed </i>fighter,
 for example, might believe you if you assured him that the only chance 
to save your life is for him to hold back an onrushing red dragon for 
"just a few seconds." Any act by you or your apparent allies that 
threatens the <i>charmed </i>person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">In any case, when you give a <i>charmed</i> subject orders (rather than just take advantage of its friendly attitude), you must win an opposed <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Charisma')">Charisma</a> check against the creature to persuade it obey. Giving an order usually is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_freeaction')">free action</a>
 for you, and making the opposed check is part of that free action. If 
your subject also is under another creature's mental control, you first 
must make an opposed check against the subject to make it obey you, then
 you must make a separate check against the other controlling character.
 The extra check isn't an action for you.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 144 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Speak</b></p>
<p align="left">In general, speaking is a free action that you can 
perform even when it isn't your turn. Some DMs may rule that a character
 can only speak on his turn, or that a character can't speak while 
flatfooted (and thus can't warn allies of a surprise threat until he has
 a chance to act). Speaking more than few sentences is generally beyond 
the limit of a free action; to communicate more information than that, 
your DM may require that you take a move action or even a full-round 
action.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><i>Charm person</i> isn't a language-dependent spell, 
but it isn't much good to you if you don't have some way to communicate 
with the subject. Speaking in a language that the subject can understand
 allows you to make the best possible use of a <i>charm person</i> 
spell. You can use pantomime to communicate with a subject; however, 
gestures won't allow you much in the way of detailed communication with a
 subject, but you can convey simple things such as "come," "go," "pick 
that up," or "open that." When in doubt, the DM might call for an 
Intelligence check to decide if the subject can understand the gestures.
 For something fairly simple, such as "come" or "go," a DC of 10 is 
sufficient. For something more complex, such as "pick that up" or "open 
that," the DC is 15. Concepts that merit a higher DC probably are too 
complex to communicate through gestures that you make up on the spot. As
 always, adjust the DC upward for unfavorable conditions, such as poor 
visibility, a particularly obtuse subject, or any situation that makes 
the gestures hard to understand, such as an overabundance of things that
 your gestures might indicate.</p>
<p align="left">If the creature you target with a <i>charm person</i> spell is currently under attack by you or your allies, or under the threat of attack, the subject gets a +5 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a> on its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throw</a>. See page 171 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 for a definition of attack as it pertains to spells. The DM must decide
 if the subject is under the threat of attack; this usually requires 
nothing more than a common sense judgment about what you and your allies
 are doing. If the subject can reasonably assume that you or your group 
will attack, it is under threat. For example, you and your group 
threaten attack if you've already attacked the subject's allies, when 
you menace the subject with weapons or spells, or when you've invaded 
some building or territory where you don't belong.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From Special Spell Effects on page 171 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Attacks:</b> Some spell descriptions refer to attacking. For instance, <i>invisibility </i>is
 dispelled if you attack anyone or anything while under its effects. All
 offensive combat actions, even those that don't damage opponents (such 
as disarm and bull rush) are considered attacks. Attempts to turn or 
rebuke undead count as attacks. All spells that opponents resist with 
saving throws, that deal damage, or that otherwise harm or hamper 
subjects are attacks. <i>Summon monster I </i>and similar spells are not attacks because the spells themselves don't harm anyone.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><i>Charm person</i> affects only humanoids. Many other spells work just like the <i>charm person</i> spell, except that they affect other kinds of creatures. These spells include <i>charm animal</i> (affects only creatures of the animal type), <i>charm monster</i> (affects creatures of all types, though not creatures immune to mind-affecting spells), <i>mass charm monster</i> (just like <i>charm monster,</i> but multiple creatures), and<i> symbol of persuasion.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Enthrall:</b></i> This spell makes other creatures
 pay attention exclusively to you. The creatures must be able to see you
 and hear you speak or sing for a full <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a> in a language they can understand (<i>enthrall</i> is language-dependent, see Part One). Though the spell description speaks of an area, <i>enthrall</i>
 is a targeted spell and you can select any number of creatures within 
range as targets for the spell. If any creature comes within range after
 you cast the spell, you can target it, too.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 227 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Enthrall</b></p>
<p align="left">Enchantment (Charm) [Language Dependent, Mind-Affecting, Sonic]<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Clr 2<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round<br><b>Range: </b>Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br><b>Targets:</b> Any number of creatures<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour or less<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates; see text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you 
can use this spell to hold them spellbound. To cast the spell, you must 
speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those 
affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their 
surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while 
under the effect of the spell (see the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>for
 information about NPC attitudes). Any potentially affected creature of a
 race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving 
throw.</p>
<p align="left">A creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 
16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of 
indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it
 opposes.</p>
<p align="left">The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those <i>enthralled </i>by
 your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds 
thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering 
the area during the performance must also successfully save or become <i>enthralled. </i>The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.</p>
<p align="left"> If those not <i>enthralled </i>have unfriendly or 
hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma 
check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, 
use the Charisma bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the 
group; others may make Charisma checks to assist (as described in Aid 
Another, page 65). The heckling ends the spell if this check result 
beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per
 use of the spell.</p>
<p align="left"> If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously <i>enthralled </i>members
 become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more 
HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Once the spell takes affect on a target, that creature 
does nothing but stand quietly and pay attention to you. It looks at you
 and listens to you. The spell lasts for as long as you speak or sing 
and for 1d3 rounds after you stop speaking or singing (but see below), 
up to a maximum of 1 hour.</p>
<p align="left">If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected 
to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends immediately (no 1d3 
rounds of additional effects occur), and the enchanted creatures become 
unfriendly or hostile to you, as noted in the spell description. Any 
attack or hostile action ends the spell, not just acts from you or your 
allies. The spell description doesn't say so, but if some third party 
ends the spell by attacking your audience, it's a good bet that the 
party who disrupted the spell also draws the audience's wrath.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compulsions</b></p>
<p align="left">Most <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_compulsionsubschool')">compulsion</a>
 spells literally force the subject to act in some manner, or not act at
 all. Many compulsions simply make their subjects feel particularly good
 (or bad) and provide bonuses (or penalties) when the subjects take 
certain actions. The <i>bless, good hope, bane,</i> and <i>crushing despair</i> spells are examples of the latter type of spell.</p>
<p align="left">Many compulsions grant the caster some degree of control
 over the subject, however, and require the same careful handling as 
charm spells. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Animal Messenger:</b></i> This spell affects one <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Tiny')">Tiny</a> creature of the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_animaltype')">animal type</a>. </p>

<p align="left">Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Drd 2, Rgr 1<br><b>Components: </b>V, S, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Target:</b> One Tiny animal<br><b>Duration:</b> One day/level<br><b> Saving Throw:</b> None; see text<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. 
The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a 
message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by 
someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal 
companions.</p>
<p align="left">Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a 
lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. 
You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you
 or an obvious landmark (such as the peak of a distant mountain). The 
directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge 
and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item 
or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated 
location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, 
whereupon it resumes its normal activities.</p>
<p align="left">During this period of waiting, the messenger allows 
others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. Unless 
the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form
 of a bird or other small animal, the carrier may be ignored. The 
intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the 
animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he or
 she doesn't know, for example).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component: </i>A morsel of food the animal likes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The target animal cannot be one tamed or trained by 
someone else. This includes familiars (which are magical beasts and not 
subject to the spell anyway) and animal companions. It also includes any
 animal that has been taught tricks or trained for a purpose with the 
Handle Animal skill.</p>
<p align="left">The spell gives you the power to impress upon the animal
 a set of directions to some location you specify, and the animal will 
carry a message to that location for you. You can attach the message or 
item to the animal somehow (such as with a collar or leg band) or have 
the animal carry it in its mouth or a manipulative appendage (if the 
animal has one). You must know the route to that location yourself and 
the directions you give must be fairly simple. The spell description 
doesn't define "simple" in the context of the spell, but I recommend 
something based on obvious landmarks and a minimal number of 
landmark-based steps, say three steps per point of <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a>
 the animal has. Such directions might include "go to the top of that 
hill" (This would require the hill to be in sight and you would have to 
point at the hill.) Other possibilities would include walk a half mile 
in that direction (you point in the direction), follow the left bank to 
the rapids, walk into the woods, and wait by the lightning-struck oak.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot communicate with the target animal in any way
 other than to direct it to the location you desire. When the animal 
reaches the location you specified, it waits there for the remaining 
duration of the spell. The spell doesn't give creatures at the location 
any special ability to communicate with the animal or any special 
ability to read or decipher any message the animal might carry for you.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Animal Trance:</b></i> This spell affects 2d6 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDie')">Hit Dice</a> worth of animals or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_magicalbeasttype')">magical beasts</a>
 with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Roll the dice to determine how many
 Hit Dice worth of creatures, then select targets for the spell. If you 
select more targets than the roll allows, the targets closest to you are
 affected first. If you select a target that the spell can't affect 
(because it is not an animal or magical beast or because it has an 
Intelligence higher than 2), that creature doesn't count against the 
number of Hit Dice the spell can affect.</p>

<p align="left">Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting)
 compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a 
creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be fascinated by this 
spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures 
that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more
 targets within range can be affected. For example, if Vadania affects 7
 HD worth of animals and there are several 2 HD wolves within close 
range, only the three closest wolves are affected.</p>
<p align="left">A magical beast, a dire animal, or an animal trained to 
attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; an animal not trained to 
attack or guard is not.</p>

<p align="left">A creature affected by this spell becomes fascinated 
with you. It takes no actions other than to pay attention to you. It 
takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and
 Spot checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature 
approaching, allows the creature a new saving throw against the spell; 
however, only a dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard (see
 the Handle Animal skill description) is allowed a saving throw against 
the spell. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting
 a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, 
automatically breaks the spell, even when a subject is not allowed a 
saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Command:</b></i> You use this spell to issue a 
single order to one living creature. You must give the order in a 
language the subject can understand (<i>command</i> is 
language-dependent; see Part One). The spell provides a short list of 
orders you can use. When affected by this spell, a creature must obey 
its order to the best of its ability and at the soonest possible moment,
 usually during its next turn after receiving the spell. The subject 
generally obeys you for 1 round. See the spell description for details.</p>

<p align="left">You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to
 the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select 
from the following options.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Approach: </i>On its turn, the subject moves toward 
you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do
 nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of 
opportunity for this movement as normal.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Drop: </i>On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Fall: </i>On its turn, the subject falls to the 
ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone 
but takes any appropriate penalties.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Flee: </i>On its turn, the subject moves away from 
you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move 
during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this 
movement as normal.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Halt: </i>The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.</p>
<p align="left">If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The <i>greater command</i> spell functions just like the <i>command</i>
 spell, except that you command multiple creatures and the creatures you
 command might obey you for multiple rounds. You must give the same 
command to each creature. An affected creature obeys you for at least 1 
round if it fails its initial save. Each round thereafter, at the start 
of its turn, the creature gets a new saving throw to end the effect. A 
successful save from one creature doesn't affect any other creatures you
 have targeted with the spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Suggestion:</b></i> Here's a potent spell that often provokes arguments. Using <i>suggestion</i>,
 you can compel a subject to undertake some activity that you can 
describe briefly. The spell description says you must be able to 
describe the activity in a sentence or two. I recommend that you limit <i>suggestions</i> to two fairly simple sentences of no more than 25 to 30 words total.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 285 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Suggestion</b></p>
<p align="left">Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 3<br><b>Components:</b> V, M<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 standard action<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Target: </b>One living creature<br><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour/level or until completed<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <i>suggestion </i>must
 be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. 
Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate 
itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the
 effect of the spell. However, a <i>suggestion </i>that a pool of acid 
is actually pure water and that a quick dip would be refreshing is 
another matter. Urging a red dragon to stop attacking your party so that
 the dragon and party could jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere is 
likewise a reasonable use of the spell's power.</p>
<p align="left">The suggested course of activity can continue for the 
entire duration, such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. 
If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell 
ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead 
specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the 
duration. For example, you might suggest that a noble knight give her 
warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met 
before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p>
<p align="left">A very reasonable <i>suggestion </i>causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2) at the discretion of the DM.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Material Component: </i>A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><i>Suggestion</i> is language-dependent, so you must speak to the subject in a language it can understand (but see Part One).</p>
<p align="left">You can't use the spell to compel a subject to do 
something suicidal or obviously harmful. The course of action you 
suggest must seem reasonable. The DM is the final judge of what's 
reasonable, but as a rule of thumb a <i>suggestion</i> should be 
something that the subject might decide to do on his own if the 
circumstances were appropriate or if the subject shared the caster's 
point of view. You can word a <i>suggestion</i> so as to make the 
requested activity seem reasonable. The spell description uses an 
example in which the caster suggests that a pool of acid is pure water 
and suggests a swim therein.</p>
<p align="left">Very reasonable <i>suggestions</i> impose a penalty on 
the saving throw. The DM must decide what is very reasonable, but in 
general, these are things that the subject might do without any special 
prompting from anyone else. A <i>suggestion</i> to flee from a fight and
 get as far away as possible would be very reasonable, especially if the
 subject was already facing defeat (or the subject has a credible 
expectation of defeat).</p>
<p align="left">A <i>suggestion</i> effect ends when the subject follows the course of action the caster specifies. You should be careful to word <i>suggestions</i> so that they can't be fulfilled in a round or two. For example, a <i>suggestion</i> to "flee" or "hide" can be completed pretty quickly, and nothing in those <i>suggestions</i> prevents the subject from rejoining a battle immediately afterward.</p>
<p align="left">The spell also allows you to specify some action that 
the subject must take in response to a trigger you specify. The 
triggered action can't be anything you couldn't normally do with the 
spell. For example, you can't use <i>suggestion</i> to order someone to 
kill himself at sundown. When describing a trigger, you must fit the 
description into the two fairly simple sentences of no more than 25 to 
30 words total that the spell allows you.</p>
<p align="left">Many spells and effects in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game allow you to make <i>suggestions</i>, including the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bard')">bard's</a> fascinate class feature (when the bard is 6th level or higher), and the <i>demand, guards and wards,</i> and <i>illusory script</i> spells. The <i>mass suggestion </i>spell works just like <i>suggestion</i> except that it affects more than one creature. You must give the same <i>suggestion</i> to each subject you affect with a single spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Dominate Person:</b></i> This spell functions much like a supercharged version of the <i>charm person</i>
 spell. The spell is not language-dependent and it provides you with a 
telepathic link with the subject. The link allows you to control the 
subject from afar (even when you can't see the subject; see the spell 
description) and to know what the subject is experiencing, as noted in 
the spell description.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 224 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Dominate Person</b></p>
<p align="left">Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br><b>Level:</b> Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 5<br><b>Components:</b> V, S<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 round<br><b>Range:</b> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br><b>Target: </b>One humanoid<br><b>Duration:</b> One day/level<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> Yes</p>
<p align="left">You can control the actions of any humanoid creature 
through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If
 you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the
 subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. 
If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, 
such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know 
what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory 
input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.</p>
<p align="left">Once you have given a <i>dominated </i>creature a 
command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the 
exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day 
survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this 
limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather 
than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being 
influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill 
description, page 81).</p>
<p align="left">Changing your instructions or giving a <i>dominated </i>creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.</p>
<p align="left">By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action),
 you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the 
subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually 
see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there 
yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject 
is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a 
guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth).</p>
<p align="left">Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to 
take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 
bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once 
control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is 
unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You 
need not see the subject to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 
round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new 
saving throw to throw off the domination.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Protection from evil </i>or a similar spell can 
prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while 
the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the 
establishment of domination nor dispels it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If you don't share a common language with the subject, 
you can give her only simple commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," 
"Fight," and "Stand still." If you and the subject share a common 
language, you can compel the subject to do just about anything you want.
 You can't force a subject to do anything obviously self-destructive, 
but just about anything else goes. If you try to force the subject to 
act against its nature, it gets a new saving throw with a +2 bonus, and a
 successful saving throw ends the spell. (It pays to be careful about 
what you order a dominated subject to do.) The DM must decide what's 
contrary to the subject's nature. The discussion of things you can 
accomplish with a <i>charm person</i> spell provides a good basis for what a dominated subject can be made to do without getting a new saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">Once a dominated subject receives an order, it tends to 
follow that order to the exclusion of all other activities (other than 
basic activities such as eating, drinking, and sleeping) until it 
fulfills the order. If the DM decides the order is against the subject's
 nature, it gets only one saving throw to resist the order and throw off
 the spell, even if the order takes some time and effort to accomplish. 
As with the <i>suggestion</i> spell, it pays to be careful how you 
phrase orders. For example, if you order a subject to attack its ally, 
it almost certainly will get a saving throw to throw off the spell. The 
subject, however, can accomplish this order with a single action. If you
 repeat the order, the subject will get a new saving throw. On the other
 hand, if you order a subject to slay one of its allies, the subject 
will get only one saving throw.</p>
<p align="left">Each day the spell lasts, you must spend 1 round 
concentrating on the subject to maintain your influence. If you don't do
 so, the spell doesn't necessarily end, but the subject gets a new 
saving throw to throw off the effect.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Dominate person</i> affects only humanoids. The <i>dominate monster</i> spell works just like <i>dominate person</i> except that it works on any kind of creature (provided it is subject to mind-affecting spells).</p>
