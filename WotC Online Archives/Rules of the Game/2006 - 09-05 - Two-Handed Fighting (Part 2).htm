 week, we reviewed the basics of two-handed fighting. This week, we'll 
consider the ins and outs of fighting with a weapon in each hand.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Melee Fighting with Two Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted in Part One, you must use the full attack action to attack with two weapons at once; if you use the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">attack</a> action, you can attack only once despite the number of weapons you wield. You also need a weapon or two, though you can use <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_unarmedattack')">unarmed</a> strikes as your "weapons" in a two-weapon attack (see page 160 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Also as noted Part One, attacking with two weapons also imposes a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_penalty')">penalty</a> on your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackroll')">attack rolls</a>.
 Fighting this way is quite difficult, and without special training, you
 don't have much chance for success. The Two-Weapon Fighting feat eases 
the penalties quite a bit, and using a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lightweapon')">light weapon</a> in your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_offhand')">off hand</a> helps, too. Table 8-10 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 shows the attack penalties for various sorts of two-weapon attacks. The
 table is reproduced here, along with a few notes and comments.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From page 143 of the <i>Player's Handbook:</i></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Full Attack</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If you get more than one attack per round because your 
base attack bonus is high enough, because you fight with two weapons or a
 double weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting under Special Attacks, page 
160), or for some special reason (such as a feat or a magic item), you 
must use a full-round action to get your additional attacks. You do not 
need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see 
how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The only movement you can take during a full attack is a
 5-foot step. You may take the step before, after, or between your 
attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you get multiple attacks because your base attack 
bonus is high enough, you must make the attacks in order from highest 
bonus to lowest. If you are using two weapons, you can strike with 
either weapon first. If you are using a double weapon, you can strike 
with either part of the weapon first.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Deciding between an Attack or a Full Attack: </b>After
 your first attack, you can decide to take a move action instead of 
making your remaining attacks, depending on how the first attack turns 
out. If you've already taken a 5-foot step, you can't use your move 
action to move any distance, but you could still use a different kind of
 move action.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Attack Penalties:</b> When you use the full attack 
action to attack with two weapons, you can make your primary and 
off-hand attacks in any order -- though most people attack with the 
primary hand first.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You do not have to choose between the attack and full 
attack actions until after you have made your first attack on your turn 
(see page 143 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). However, if you intend 
to attack with two weapons during your action, you must take the correct
 penalty for each attack or give up your opportunity to use your second 
weapon (because the rules require you to take a penalty on attacks you 
make with both your primary and off hands). For example, suppose you 
hold a longsword in your primary hand and carry a lit torch in your off 
hand. It's reasonable to assume the torch is a light weapon, albeit an 
improvised weapon. You don't have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, but 
being able to see in the torchlight is more important to you than a 
shield right now.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If something leaps out at you and you decide to hack at 
it with your sword, you could also try to whack it with your torch 
(perhaps the foe seems slightly flammable, or perhaps you suspect you're
 facing a regenerating monster). You can make your attack roll with your
 longsword and observe the result before deciding between an attack or a
 full attack, but you must take a -4 attack penalty on that primary hand
 attack to preserve your option to attack with the torch. In this 
situation it would be entirely reasonable for the DM to make you take 
the -4 attack penalty before you see your first attack's result (because
 it speeds play); however that's not strictly necessary. The DM might 
allow you to see the result before deciding to attack with the torch. If
 that is so and you decide to try an attack with the torch, your DM must
 recalculate the result of your sword attack, taking the primary weapon 
penalty into account. (I don't recommend this option, but it fits the 
letter of the rules.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even if you decide to take the penalty, you don't have 
to attack with the torch, or even use the full attack action. If you 
decide to attack with the torch, you make a single attack with the torch
 and you'll take a -8 penalty for the off-hand attack and an additional 
-4 penalty for the improvised weapon (see page 113 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>), for a total penalty of -12.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once you take a two-weapon fighting penalty, the penalty applies to all the attacks you make with that hand during your current <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a>.
 It does not apply to attacks you make during some other character's 
turn. For example, say your torch-wielding swordfighter from the 
previous example has a base attack bonus of +10. With the full attack 
action, the character could make two attacks with the sword: one at +10 
and the other at +5.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you opt to throw in an off-hand attack with the 
torch, the -4 penalty for your primary hand applies to both attacks, 
dropping your attack bonus to +6 (10-4 = 6) and +1 (5-4 = 1). When you 
attack with the torch, you make only a single attack (because the 
two-weapon fighting option allows you only one extra attack) at -2 (you 
use your full attack bonus for the single attack, so that's 10 -8 for an
 off-hand attack with a light weapon and an additional -4 for the 
improvised weapon).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some attack penalties you voluntarily assume, such as the penalty for defensive fighting (see pages 140 and 143 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>), apply until your next turn, but two weapon penalties are not one of them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If, after you made two-weapon attacks with your sword 
and torch, a foe later provokes an attack of opportunity from you that 
same round, you can strike that foe with your longsword with no 
two-weapon penalty at all. (You also can use just the torch, also with 
no two-weapon penalty, though you still take the -4 penalty for an 
off-hand attack; you also still take the -4 penalty for an improvised 
weapon for a total penalty of -8.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Light Weapons:</b> Refer to Table 7-5 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> to determine if a weapon is light. If you're using a weapon from a book other than the <i>Player's Handbook,</i>
 refer to the tables (or weapon description) provided in that book to 
determine if a weapon is light. Remember that an unarmed strike is 
considered a light weapon and that the off-hand end of a double weapon 
also is considered a light weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ability Modifiers in Two-Weapon Melee Fighting</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The text in the previous section ignores any <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitymodifier')">ability modifiers</a> that apply to your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee attacks</a>. Your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> modifier applies to any <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattackroll')">melee attack roll</a>
 you make, even to attacks with an off-hand weapon. Your damage bonus 
(if any) from Strength is always halved for your off hand whether your 
off-hand weapon is light or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_onehandedweapon')">one-handed</a> (see page 113 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you use the Weapon Finesse feat when attacking with two weapons in melee, your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a>
 modifier applies to attacks you make with any weapon that can receive 
it (a light weapon, or a rapier, whip, or spiked chain; see the feat 
description). If you're using one weapon that can receive the Dexterity 
modifier and one that cannot, use your Strength modifier to resolve your
 attack (or attacks) with the latter weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When using the Weapon Finesse feat (see page 102 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>),
 the armor check penalty from any shield you carry applies to your 
attack rolls. This doesn't present a problem when you're fighting with 
two weapons unless you happen to be using a weapon that also has an 
armor check penalty, such as a spiked shield. If so, the armor check 
penalty applies to any attack you make with the Weapon Finesse feat.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For example, if you carry a rapier and a spiked 
masterwork heavy steel shield, you would use your Dexterity modifier for
 attacks with the rapier and you'd take a -1 penalty for the shield's 
armor check penalty (-2 reduced to -1 because it's masterwork). If you 
attack with both the rapier and the spiked heavy steel shield, you'd use
 your Strength modifier to resolve the shield attack (because the shield
 is a one-handed weapon and cannot receive your Dexterity modifier) and 
its armor check penalty would not apply because you aren't using it with
 Weapon Finesse. Your rapier attack would be resolved as noted 
previously and both weapons would receive additional attack penalties 
for being your primary or off-hand weapon in a two-weapon attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ranged Fighting with Two Weapons</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Attacks with two <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_thrownweapon')">thrown weapons</a> work just as noted for melee weapons, except that you use your Dexterity modifier to resolve <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attacks</a>.
 You still use your Strength modifier for damage rolls (but only half 
your Strength bonus for damage rolls with your off-hand weapon).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Ranged weapons you don't throw use most of the rules for
 two-weapon fighting; however, the Two-Weapon Fighting feat and related 
feats don't apply to ranged weapons that aren't thrown. Because most 
ranged weapons that aren't thrown are two-handed weapons, this isn't a 
big deal. Crossbows, however, can be fired (but not reloaded) with one 
hand. The crossbow weapon descriptions in Chapter 7 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i> cover shooting the two crossbows. Here's a summary:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hand Crossbow: </b>Treat a hand crossbow as a light weapon in a two-weapon attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Light Crossbow:</b> Treat a light crossbow as a light
 weapon in a two-weapon attack; you also take a -2 attack penalty when 
firing a light crossbow one-handed. If you were shooting a light 
crossbow with each hand you'd have a -6 penalty with your primary hand 
and a -10 penalty with your off hand. A light crossbow is a light 
weapon, so the basic penalty is -4 for your primary hand and -8 for your
 off hand, and you must add the -2 penalty for one-handed shooting on 
top of that.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Heavy Crossbow:</b> Treat a heavy crossbow as a 
one-handed weapon in a two-weapon attack; you also take a -4 attack 
penalty when firing a heavy crossbow one-handed. If you were shooting a 
heavy crossbow with each hand, you'd have a -10 penalty with your 
primary hand and a -14 penalty with your off hand. A heavy crossbow is a
 one-handed weapon, so the basic penalty is -6 for your primary hand and
 -10 for your off hand, and you must add the -4 penalty for one-handed 
shooting on top of that.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Repeating Crossbow:</b> Use the rules for the 
crossbow's size. Even when the repeating crossbow's magazine holds 
bolts, you must use two hands to reload it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Slings</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can fire, but not reload, a sling with one hand. You can't use a sling as part of a two-weapon attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That's all the time we have for this week. Next week, 
we'll conclude our look at two-weapon fighting with a few examples of 
two-weapon fighting and we'll consider a few related topics.</p>
