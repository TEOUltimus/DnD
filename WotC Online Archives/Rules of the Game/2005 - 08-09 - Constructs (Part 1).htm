<p align="left">The cast of villains in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game includes
 a host of creatures that range from the familiar, such as animals and 
humanoids, to the utterly alien, such as aberrations and undead.</p>
<p align="left"><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_constructtype')">Constructs</a>
 fit into the unfamiliar end of the spectrum. Many players and DMs have 
some difficulty understanding what makes these creatures tick (though 
few constructs literally tick). The addition of living constructs in <i>Monster Manual III</i> clouds the picture further. This month, we'll work on demystifying the construct creature type. We'll start with a few basics.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What Is Creature? </b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From page 312 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Nonabilities:</b> Some creatures lack certain ability
 scores. These creatures do not have an ability score of 0--they lack 
the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0. Other 
effects of nonabilities are detailed below.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Strength: </i>Any creature that can physically 
manipulate other objects has at least 1 point of Strength. A creature 
with no Strength score can't exert force, usually because it has no 
physical body (a spectre, for example) or because it doesn't move (a 
shrieker). The creature automatically fails Strength checks. If the 
creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modifier to its base 
attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Dexterity: </i>Any creature that can move has at 
least 1 point of Dexterity. A creature with no Dexterity score can't 
move (a shrieker, for example). If it can perform actions (such as 
casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modifier to initiative 
checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature automatically fails
 Reflex saves and Dexterity checks.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Constitution: </i>Any living creature has at least 1 
point of Constitution. A creature with no Constitution has no body (a 
spectre, for example) or no metabolism (a golem). It is immune to any 
effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on objects
 or is harmless. For example, a zombie is unaffected by any type of 
poison but is susceptible to a <i>disintegrate </i>spell. The creature 
is also immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain, and 
automatically fails Constitution checks. A creature with no Constitution
 cannot tire and thus can run indefinitely without tiring (unless the 
creature's description says it cannot run).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Intelligence: </i>Any creature that can think, learn,
 or remember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A creature with no 
Intelligence score is mindless, an automaton operating on simple 
instincts or programmed instructions. It has immunity to mind-affecting 
effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) 
and automatically fails Intelligence checks. Mindless creatures do not 
gain feats or skills, although they may have bonus feats or racial skill
 bonuses.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Wisdom: </i>Any creature that can perceive its 
environment in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom. Anything with
 no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a Wisdom
 score also has no Charisma score.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Charisma: </i>Any creature capable of telling the 
difference between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1 
point of Charisma. Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a 
creature. Anything without a Charisma score also has no Wisdom score.</p>

<p align="left">A construct is a kind of creature. According to the glossary in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creature</a>
 is a living or otherwise active being that is not an object. 
Unfortunately, the glossary doesn't include an entry for objects. So 
what's the difference between a creature and an object? The <i>Monster Manual </i>glossary gives us a clue. A creature has both a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Charisma')">Charisma</a> score, which gives it self-awareness, and a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Wisdom')">Wisdom</a> score, which gives it perception. In the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game, perception and self-awareness come as a set -- you don't have one
 without the other. Anything that lacks Charisma and Wisdom scores is an
 object, not a creature. In this case, self-awareness can be 
rudimentary. In game terms, anything capable of distinguishing between 
itself and that which is not itself to any degree at all is self-aware.</p>
<p align="left">Philosophers can argue about whether the <b>D&amp;D</b> game's method of distinguishing between creatures and objects is valid, but the definition works for game purposes.</p>
<p align="left">It's worth noting that in the <b>D&amp;D </b>game, some 
objects are alive and some creatures are not. A tree, for example, is a 
living thing. It lacks a Charisma and a Wisdom score, however, and is an
 object. The <b>D&amp;D</b> game teems with unliving creatures, including undead and constructs.</p>
<p align="left">It's also worth noting that you can mimic perception. 
For example, a trap that fires an arrow when someone trips a wire could 
be said to have a limited ability to perceive intruders. In game terms, 
however, true perception requires a Wisdom score (and consequentially a 
Charisma score).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Construct Traits</b></p>
<p align="left">The <i>Monster Manual</i> glossary includes a brief 
entry stating what distinguishes a construct from another kind of 
creature. Here are a few notes to flesh out the glossary entry. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Artificial Beings:</b> An object animated with the <i>animate object</i><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>
 is a construct. So are most creatures that are built through some 
artificial means rather than bred, cloned, sprouted, or created through 
any natural process.</p>
<p align="left">Not all artificial creatures are constructs. Spells such as <i>animate dead</i> and <i>create undead</i> produce undead creatures, not constructs. The <i>simulacrum </i>spell
 creates a duplicate of some other creature and the duplicate has the 
same creature type as the original. In general, a construct is a unique 
kind of creature, not a previously existing creature brought back from 
death or an attempt to copy another creature. A construct also usually 
is built up, piece by piece (except in the case of an animated object) 
from inert materials.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unassailable Mind:</b> Many constructs have no 
Intelligence scores and no minds. This gives them immunity to all 
mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and 
morale effects). Constructs that have Intelligence scores effectively 
have minds hardwired into their bodies -- their minds aren't subject to 
outside manipulation and they have the same immunities that mindless 
constructs have.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unliving:</b> A construct is not alive. It has no 
Constitution score and it has no biological processes to disrupt (or to 
sustain it, either). This gives a construct several benefits and a few 
drawbacks.</p>
<p align="left">Constructs don't eat, sleep, or breathe, and most 
constructs cannot do any of these things. One could, however, build a 
construct that can mimic these activities.</p>
<p align="left">Constructs lack nervous systems, circulatory systems, 
and vital organs. As a consequence, a construct isn't subject to poison,
 sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and 
necromancy effects. A construct also is not subject to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_criticalhit')">critical hits</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nonlethaldamage')">nonlethal damage</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydamage')">ability damage</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilitydrain')">ability drain</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fatigued')">fatigue</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_exhausted')">exhaustion</a>, or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_energydrain')">energy drain</a>. The rules don't say so, but a construct also cannot be <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_nauseated')">nauseated</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_sickened')">sickened</a>. A living construct can use the run action, but doing so will tire it out, as noted on page 144 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> A living construct suffers all the normal effects of a forced march (see page 164 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>). A regular construct can run or force march without tiring.</p>
<p align="left">The lack of any biological activity in a construct's body leaves it immune to any effect that requires a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Fortitudesave')">Fortitude save</a>
 unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless. When dealing 
with a spell, see the spell's area, target, or effect entry to determine
 if the spell affects objects. See the spell's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throw</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spellresistance')">spell resistance</a> entries to determine if the spell is harmless. <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a> contains further notes on determining what a spell can affect.</p>
<p align="left">A construct's unliving body cannot heal damage on its 
own unless the construct also has the fast healing special quality. 
However, one could repair damage to a construct through the Craft 
Construct feat (see below). The various <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_curespell')">cure wounds spells</a> from the <i>Player's Handbook</i> don't work on constructs. Specific spells or effects noted in the construct's description can restore <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a> a construct has lost. For example, fire heals damage an iron golem has suffered. Certain arcane spells, such as the <i>repair damage </i>spells from the<i> Complete Arcane,</i> also can remove damage from a construct.</p>
<p align="left">A living creature's body is subject to premature death 
if it suffers a massive shock or injury sufficient to disrupt its 
biological functions. In the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, the death from <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_massivedamage')">massive damage</a> rule (see page 145 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>)
 represents this vulnerability. A living creature also has the ability 
to cling to life and recover from wounds that render it nonfunctional. 
The rules for death and dying (see pages 145-146 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>) represent this capacity.</p>
<p align="left">A construct's hit points represent its body's total 
ability to withstand punishment and keep functioning. It has no 
biological functions to disrupt, but it also has nothing to keep it 
hovering on death's door when badly injured. It is not subject to the 
death from massive damage rule; however, it is immediately destroyed 
(broken into junk) when reduced to 0 hit points or less.</p>
<p align="left">Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mass Equals Hit Points:</b> Destroying a construct 
requires smashing so much of its structure that it literally falls 
apart. A construct gains bonus hit points based on size, as shown on 
page 307 in the <i>Monster Manual</i>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Standard Senses:</b> All constructs in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game can see unless otherwise noted in their descriptions. Vision is 
either built into the construct or magically bestowed through the spell 
or ritual that animates it. All constructs have <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lowlightvision')">low-light vision</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_darkvision')">darkvision</a>
 with a range of 60 feet. The rules don't say so, but it's a reasonable 
assumption that a typical construct sees at least as well as typical 
human does when it does not have to rely on low-light vision or 
darkvision.</p>
<p align="left">Constructs have no special ability or inability to hear 
sounds, and it's reasonable to assume that a construct hears at least as
 well as a human unless its description says otherwise.</p>
<p align="left">Constructs don't eat, so it's a pretty good bet they don't have a sense of taste or smell.</p>
<p align="left">A construct's immunity to critical hits and death from 
massive damage suggests that it doesn't have much of a sense of pain, 
though a construct with an Intelligence score probably has some way to 
assess how much damage it has suffered. Likewise, a construct also 
probably doesn't have much sense of touch. It probably can recognize 
some textures. I imagine a construct probably can feel about as well as a
 human wearing a pair of household work gloves.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That covers the basics of constructs. Next week, we'll 
examine making and repairing constructs. We'll also consider how 
constructs act during encounters.</p>
