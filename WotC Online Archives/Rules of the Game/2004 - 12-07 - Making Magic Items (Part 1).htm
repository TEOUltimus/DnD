<p align="left">The statement "I want to make a magic item" has the 
power to freeze a DM's blood. Players, too, can find the item creation 
process intimidating. Sometimes these fears are justified, especially 
when someone invents an entirely new item and then wants to sit down and
 make it. Many magic items, however, aren't so hard to make. This series
 of articles examines the magic item creation process in detail, 
beginning with fairly straightforward items and moving on to the more 
troublesome ones.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Some Key Terms </b></p>
<p align="left">Take a look at a few terms you'll encounter in this article and in the rules when they discuss magic items.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Activation:</b> Most items won't work until they are activated, usually with the activate magic item <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_action')">action</a>.</p>
<p align="left">All magic items in the core <b>D&amp;D</b> game use one of four activation methods: <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spellcompletionitem')">spell completion</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spelltriggeritem')">spell trigger</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_commandworditem')">command word</a>, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_useactivateditem')">use</a>. All of these are discussed on page 213 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> and in <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20041116a">Part Two of Using Magic Items</a>. An item's activation method greatly affects its cost. In general, the easier an item is to use, the more it costs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Base Price:</b> A value used to determine how much it
 costs to make or buy an item. An item's base price depends on what the 
item does and how often it can do it. Table 7-33 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> shows typical base prices for magic items.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Caster Level:</b> Every magic item must have a caster
 level, which determines the item's own saving throw bonuses when the 
item must make a saving throw. If an item can produce a spell effect, 
its caster level determines any level-based variables the spell effect 
might have (such as range and damage). An item's caster level also 
determines how susceptible the item or the spell effects it produces are
 to <i>dispel magic</i> effects.</p>
<p align="left">In general, the higher an item's caster level, the more it costs to buy or make.</p>
<p align="left">When creating items, the creator's caster level must be at least as high as the item's caster level. Your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_casterlevel')">caster level</a>
 is your level in the class that gives you access to a particular spell 
needed for the item (see the section on prerequisites). In some cases, 
your caster level will be less than your <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_classlevel')">class level</a>;
 if so, the class description notes it. For example, a paladin's caster 
level is one-half her paladin level (a paladin of 3rd level or lower has
 no caster level at all).</p>
<p align="left">If you are multiclassed, you may have different caster 
levels for the spells you have by virtue of your various classes. For 
example, a 4th-level paladin/5th-level sorcerer has a caster level of 2 
for paladin spells and a caster level of 5 for sorcerer spells. If you 
have taken a prestige class, your levels in that class may stack with 
levels in another class to determine your caster level. Otherwise, your 
levels in your various spellcasting classes usually don't stack for 
purposes of determining your caster level.</p>
<p align="left">If you draw on different classes to get access to 
different spells you need for an item, you must use the lowest of the 
various applicable caster levels.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Charge:</b> A discrete unit of an item's power that 
is used up when someone activates the item. For example, a newly created
 wand has 50 charges. An item becomes nonmagical when all its charges 
are used up.</p>
<p align="left">In general, a charged item cannot be recharged.</p>
<p align="left">An item also might have a limited number of uses each day (such as a <i>rod of enemy detection,</i>
 which works three times a day). The rules sometimes refer to these 
limited daily uses as charges per day. When this article refers to a 
charge, however, it means something that is permanently used up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Item Slot:</b> A specific part of the user's body where an item must be worn before it can function. Sometimes it is simply called a slot.</p>
<p align="left">For certain kinds of magic items, some item slots work 
better than others. For example, items related to movement are cheapest 
to make when they're made as boots. Items that don't require slots 
usually cost more to make (and thus to buy) than items that do not.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Market Price: </b>The cost, in gold pieces, that an 
item brings on the open market. Sometimes this is simply called price. 
An item's market price is a retail price (or the price a character must 
pay when buying the item). Characters who sell used items can expect to 
get only half the market price.</p>
<p align="left">An item's market price is its base price, plus the cost 
of any extra special materials the item requires, plus an increase for 
any additional experience the creator must expend when making the item 
(see Magic Item Creation Basics).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Level:</b> For purposes of creating magic 
items, a spell's level is the level where the spell appears on the item 
creator's class spell list. For example, <i>hold person</i> is a 
2nd-level spell for a bard or cleric, but a 3rd-level spell for a wizard
 or sorcerer. In general, the lower the spell's level, the less it costs
 to make an item that stores or produces the spell. Items from the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> usually are made by whatever character has the required spells available at the lowest possible spell level.</p>
<p align="left">Whenever a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_0levelspell')">0-level spell</a>
 is used in making a magic item, treat the spell's level as 1/2 when 
calculating the item's cost (see Magic Item Creation Basics).</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Magic Item Creation Basics </b></p>
<p align="left">Creating a magic item requires time, money, and experience, among other things. Chapter 7 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> covers the process in detail. Here's an overview of what's involved, along with some additional notes:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisites </b></p>
<p align="left">Every item has a list of prerequisites, which are shown 
right after the item's caster level in the item's description. (If a 
character wants to make a new item, the item's description must include a
 list of prerequisites.) Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one
 feat and one or more spells; however, an item's prerequisites can 
include multiple feats, spells, and also miscellaneous requirements such
 as level, alignment, skills, and race or kind. When two spells at the 
end of a prerequisites list are separated by<i></i>"or," only one of 
those spells is required in addition to every other spell mentioned 
prior to the last two. For example, the prerequisites for a <i>ring of three </i>wishes are the Forge Ring feat and <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle, </i>meaning that either the <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle </i>spell<i></i>is
 required as well as the Forge Ring feat. In addition, the item's 
creator must have a caster level at least as high as the item's caster 
level (see page 215 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). Also, an item's creator must have a caster level high enough to cast any prerequisite spell the item has.</p>
<p align="left">Two or more characters can work together to create an 
item, with each character providing one or more prerequisites. To 
provide a spell prerequisite, a character must have prepared the spell 
(or know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard). The rules say 
you can use a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spelllikeability')">spell-like ability</a>
 that produces the desired spell effect to provide a spell prerequisite.
 A command or use-activated item cannot provide a spell prerequisite.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cost </b></p>
<p align="left">Every magic item has a base price. Table 7-33 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>gives formulas for estimating base prices<i>.</i>
 Whenever a formula includes a spell's level, treat a 0-level spell as 
1/2 level. For example, a scroll that contains a 0-level spell has a 
base cost of 1/2 x caster level x 25 gp.</p>
<p align="left">Someone, usually the item's creator, must pay half the 
base price in gold pieces for the supplies consumed while creating the 
item. The item's creator also must invest experience points. The 
experience cost is 1/25th the base price. Under the core <b>D&amp;D</b> 
rules, no one but the item creator can pay this experience cost (but see
 the notes on cooperatively making an item in Part Seven).</p>
<p align="left">According to the rules, you can never spend so much 
experience that you lose a level -- though you can delay gaining a level
 and instead keep your experience points available for item creation (or
 spellcasting). If you do so, you always can change your mind. That is, 
you can gain a new level anytime you have enough experience to do so, 
even after delaying awhile. See <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040810a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a> for information on delaying level advancement.</p>
<p align="left">Some items require additional materials, which entail 
extra costs (see the section on equipment and materials). The extra cost
 increases the item's market price, but not the experience the creator 
must expend.</p>
<p align="left">Some items might also have an extra experience cost, 
which usually happens when they involve spells that have an experience 
cost of their own. An additional experience cost increases the item's 
market price by 5 gp per extra XP spent.</p>
<p align="left">Table 7-32 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>summarizes item creation costs<i>.</i></p>
<p align="left">If a character abandons an unfinished magic item to work
 on a second item (see the section on time), any money or experience 
spent on the first item is wasted. The supplies purchased for the 
abandoned item cannot be reused, and another character cannot pick up 
where the creator left off.</p>
<p align="left">DMs might want make an exception for some kinds of special supplies, such as <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_masterwork')">masterwork</a> items. For example, if someone begins working on a <i>+2 longsword</i>
 and then abandons the project in favor of another item, the 4,000 gp 
and 320 XP (the sword's base price of 8,000 gp, take half of that to 
determine the cost of supplies and 1/25th of that to determine the 
experience cost) are wasted. However, the masterwork longsword purchased
 to make the item (at a cost of 315 gp) can be used for another magic 
sword.</p>
<p align="left">When two or more characters cooperate to create an item,
 they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator. 
Use the designated creator's caster level for any aspect of the item 
creation process that uses the creator's caster level. The designated 
creator pays the XP required to make the item. The rules don't say so, 
but it's best to assume that when a character provides a prerequisite 
spell that has an XP component he or she also pays the XP costs for that
 spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Time </b></p>
<p align="left">For every 1,000 gp in an item's base price (or fraction 
of 1,000 gp), the creator must spend one day working on the item. For 
example, an item with a base price of 1,000 gp or less takes one day to 
make. An item that costs more than 1,000 gp, but no more than 2,000 gp, 
takes two days to make. A potion always takes just one day to make, no 
matter what the base price (see page 286 <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left">For purposes of item creation, a day of work is 8 hours.
 You cannot rush the process by working longer each day. The rules say 
that the days you spend working on an item need not be consecutive -- 
you can leave the project for as long as you like and return to work 
anytime. Likewise, interruptions during your working day don't affect 
the process. If an attack breaks your concentration, you can resume 
working after the danger has passed. As an optional rule, you might want
 to add 1 hour to the total time required that day for each interruption
 the creator suffers. In any case, if you can put 8 hours of effort into
 an item during a day (or 8 hours plus extra time for interruptions), 
that day counts as a day you've spent working on the item. If you can't 
put in 8 hours of work on an item, the whole day is lost, but there's no
 other ill effect on the creation process.</p>
<p align="left">A character can work on only one magic item at a time. 
If a character starts working on a second item, the first item is 
automatically abandoned (see the section on costs). </p>
<p align="left">Other than the loss of prerequisite spells (see the 
section on prerequisites), and the time requirement, item creation 
doesn't impose any restrictions on your activities during the days when 
you work on an item.</p>
<p align="left">You must expend all the money and experience required to
 make an item when you begin the process. If an item has a spell (or 
spells) as a prerequisite, you must have the spell or spells available 
to you at the start of each day that you work on the item; the spell or 
spells are used up for that day when you begin working on the item. 
Since you're not actually casting the spell, you don't expend any extra 
experience or money for expensive material components each day. Instead 
these costs are added to the item's overall creation cost according to 
the kind of item (see Parts Two through Five). For example, a <i>ring of invisibility</i>
 has a base price of 20,000 gp (which happens to be the same as its 
market price), and it takes twenty days to make. A wizard making a <i>ring of invisibility</i> must prepare an <i>invisibility</i>
 spell each day spent working on the ring, and the spell is expended, 
just as if cast, each day as soon as work on the ring commences. A 
sorcerer working on a r<i>ing of invisibility</i> need not prepare any spells, but he must know the <i>invisibility</i>
 spell. Each day the sorcerer works on the ring, one of the sorcerer's 
2nd-level spells is expended as soon as work on the ring commences. A 
character relying on a scroll to provide the required <i>invisibility</i> spell would need at least 20 scrolls -- one for each day of working on the ring.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Environment </b></p>
<p align="left">Creating an item requires peace, quiet, and comfort, 
just as preparing spells does (even when the item creator doesn't need 
to prepare spells). The surroundings need not be luxurious, but they 
must be free from overt distractions. Exposure to inclement weather 
prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed 
saving throw the character might experience while working (but see the 
section on time).</p>
<p align="left">Any location a character uses for item creation also 
must have enough space to hold any special equipment and materials the 
item requires (see the Equipment and Materials below and in Parts Two 
through Five). If an item requires very little in the way of equipment 
and materials (for example, a scroll), the character may find a suitable
 creation environment almost anywhere.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Equipment and Materials </b></p>
<p align="left">Chapter 7 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> gives 
very brief descriptions of what's required to create various kinds of 
items. The details are pretty sketchy, but that helps keep things 
simple. At the very least, making an item requires supplies that cost 
one half the item's base price. Some items require additional supplies, 
such as a masterwork item for a magic weapon or suit of armor or special
 material components if the item requires spells that have costly 
components. Some items also require special equipment, such as 
metalworking tools. Supplies bought to make one magic item cannot be 
reused in another item, but tools usually can be. Parts Two through Six 
examine the required equipment and supplies in detail.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That pretty well covers the basics. Next week, we'll look at what's involved in creating potions and scrolls.</p>
