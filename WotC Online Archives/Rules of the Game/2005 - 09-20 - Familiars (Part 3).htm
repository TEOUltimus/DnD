 familiars gain as their masters gain levels. This week, we conclude our
 look at familiar abilities, and then we consider how familiars function
 as creatures and how one acquires a familiar.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>More Special Abilities </b></p>
<p align="left">As with the abilities discussed in Parts One and Two, 
most of these abilities are affected by proximity to the master or the 
master's level, or both. Most of these abilities are extraordinary or 
supernatural.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar can speak with its master if the master is at least 5th level.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The familiar and master can communicate verbally as if 
they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the
 communication. In effect, the master and familiar have their own 
private language.</p>
<p align="left">Eavesdroppers can use <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spells</a> such as <i>tongues</i> to understand a conversation between a master and familiar.</p>
<p align="left">Speaking with the master is an extraordinary ability; using it usually is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_freeaction')">free action</a>, just as speaking is.</p>
<p align="left">Familiars that can speak a language (or several 
languages) can converse with their masters normally if they choose. If 
they do so, anyone who overhears the conversation understands it, 
provided that the listener speaks the language used, just as with any 
other normal conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li> When the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can speak with animals of its kind.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">An <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_animaltype')">animal</a> that becomes a familiar becomes a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_magicalbeast')">magical beast</a>
 (see below), so this ability causes some confusion. An animal familiar 
can communicate with animals of approximately the same sort as itself 
(including dire variants) before it became a familiar (as shown on the 
table below).</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"> Speaking with an animal is an extraordinary ability; 
using it usually is a free action, just as speaking is. Speaking with an
 animal is otherwise similar to using a <i>speak with animals</i> spells (though not magical).</p>
<p align="left">Improved familiars do not have the ability to speak with
 other creatures of their kind, but many improved familiars already 
speak one or more languages.</p>
<ul>
<li> A familiar with a master of 11th level or higher has <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spellresistance')">spell resistance</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The spell resistance rating is the master's level +5. 
See Part One for a discussion of what constitutes the master's level. If
 the familiar already has spell resistance (as some improved familiars 
do), the two don't stack. The familiar uses the higher number.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="290"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left">From page 298 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>:</p>
<p align="left">A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. 
Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of 
opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down 
until the creature's next turn. At the beginning of the creature's next 
turn, the creature's spell resistance automatically returns unless the 
creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does 
not provoke an attack of opportunity).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The rules don't mention how a familiar's spell 
resistance interacts with the master's spells. I recommend that you do 
not apply the familiar's spell resistance to spells the caster shares 
with the familiar. It does, however, apply to spells anyone casts on the
 familiar, including the master. The familiar can, of course, lower its 
spell resistance to receive a spell from anyone; see page 298 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>A master of 13th level or higher can <i>scry</i> on her familiar once a day.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This is a spell-like ability that the master gains through the familiar. The power works just like the <i>scry</i> spell cast at the master's caster level.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The animal familiars shown in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 grant their masters additional abilities based on their kind, as shown 
on the table on page 52. As noted in the text accompanying the table, 
these abilities function whenever the master and familiar are within one
 mile of each other. <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofsight')">Line of sight</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_lineofeffect')">line of effects</a>
 between master and familiar aren't necessary, but the master and 
familiar must be on the same plane. The rules don't say so, but I 
recommend that you treat these abilities as a function of the empathic 
link between master and familiar (see Part Two). When the empathic link 
does not function, neither does the benefit the master gets from the 
familiar.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Familiars as Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> an animal that
 becomes a familiar effectively becomes a magical beast. For purposes of
 resolving effects that depend on a creature's type, a familiar is not 
an animal but a magical beast. Spells such as <i>speak with animals</i> or <i>animal growth</i> do not work on familiars. Likewise, a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ranger')">ranger</a>
 with animals as a favored enemy would not gain favored enemy bonuses 
when dealing with the familiar (but a ranger with magical beasts as a 
favored enemy would).</p>
<p align="left">The change from animal to magical beast has no other effects on the familiar. The familiar's <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_HitDie')">Hit Dice</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilityscore')">ability scores</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackbonus')">attack bonus</a>, skills, feats, and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrowbonus')">saving throw bonuses</a>
 do not change as a result of the change in type. Once a creature 
becomes a familiar, however, most of its statistics change to reflect 
the master, as noted in Part One.</p>
<p align="left">Improved familiars that are not animals retain their type when they become familiars, as noted on page 200 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<p align="left">Any familiar becomes an extension of the master and its 
powers improve as the master improves, as noted earlier. A familiar 
cannot earn <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_experiencepoints')">experience points</a> or have a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_class')">class</a>.</p>
<p align="left">In spite of its links to the master, a familiar can 
think and act on its own. It can perform any number of tasks that don't 
exceed its physical limits. All familiars are as smart as people (the 
minimum <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Intelligence')">Intelligence</a>
 score for a familiar is 6), but usually not as smart as a particularly 
bright person. This makes familiars much better at most tasks than 
trained animals. All familiars have some sense of past, present, and 
future, can count (at least up to 100), and can recognize everyday 
creatures, objects, and activities. Animal familiars, especially if they
 have Intelligence scores of 9 or less, are apt to be distracted by 
things that are important to animals, such as food, other animals, and 
big, dangerous creatures lurking nearby (and remember that when you're <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Tiny')">Tiny</a>, just about everyone else seems really big). The master probably will have to remind the familiar about the business at hand.</p>
<p align="left">Unless the familiar actually speaks a language, it 
cannot relay the contents of any conversations it overhears, even when 
it can speak with the master. It can, however, describe who is talking, 
single out the creature who does the most talking, and assess the mood 
of the speakers. No matter what its Intelligence score, a familiar 
cannot read or write, so it cannot copy documents or relay their 
contents. A familiar probably can swipe a document, however.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Acquiring a Familiar</b></p>
<p align="left">The rules speak of summoning a familiar, but do not go 
into much detail about the process other than noting that the process 
takes 24 hours and uses up materials that cost 100 gp. Here are a few 
thoughts to flesh out the process.</p>
<p align="left">A familiar is not a conjured creature and is not subject to effects, such as <i>protection from evil</i> or <i>dismissal,</i>
 that banish or hedge out conjured creatures. It is better to think of 
the process as one of binding a familiar rather than summoning it. To 
begin, the master must first locate the kind of creature desired. Unless
 the master has the Improved Familiar feat, the prospective familiar 
must be a normal, unmodified animal. The prospective familiar cannot be 
an advanced animal, nor can it be another character's animal companion 
(through the animal companion class feature) or another character's 
familiar. If the master has the Improved Familiar feat, the character 
can acquire a more powerful creature as a familiar, but still must 
locate the creature first, and the creature cannot be an advanced 
specimen, nor can it be another character's companion or familiar.</p>
<p align="left">The master can use any convenient means to locate the 
intended familiar. In cities, one could visit a shop and perhaps 
purchase a suitable animal. Improved familiars usually take more effort 
to locate. The familiar should be one or two size categories smaller 
than the master. Pages 203-204 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> show alternative familiars for masters of various sizes.</p>
<p align="left">After locating the familiar, the master must arrange to 
keep the familiar nearby for the daylong ritual that binds the two 
together. Lucky masters choose familiars that are friendly enough to 
stick around on their own, but sometimes the creature must be tethered 
or caged to keep it from wandering off.</p>
<p align="left">The ritual fails if the intended familiar is hostile or 
unfriendly to the master (see Diplomacy skill description). If the 
intended familiar has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (before any 
increase for becoming a familiar), the creature must be friendly toward 
the character. If the creature's attitude is unsuitable, the master can 
try any nonmagical means to alter the creature's attitude, such as 
Diplomacy checks or bribes (or both). The ritual will not succeed if the
 intended familiar is under any charm or compulsion effect.</p>
<p align="left">A character can have only one familiar at a time and a 
familiar can have only one master at time. A creature that already is 
(or has ever been) another character's familiar cannot become a new 
master's familiar.</p>
<p align="left">The ritual itself can take any form the DM desires; 
however, a few gestures, chants, and perhaps some drawings sketched on 
the floor around the pair -- all repeated at intervals throughout the 
day -- is all that's necessary.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That's all the time we have this week. Next week, we'll 
briefly consider the ins and outs of protecting a familiar during combat
 and just what happens to a familiar or master when one of the pair 
dies.</p>
