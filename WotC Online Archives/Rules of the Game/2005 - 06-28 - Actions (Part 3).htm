<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">This week, we examine a selection of standard and move actions and how they affect play.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Standard Actions</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, you can use a standard action and 
still have time for a move action as well. You can substitute a move 
action for a standard action, but not vice versa. You can use only one 
standard action each round, and you can't use any standard action if you
 use a full-round action.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Attack:</b> Use this action to make a single melee or
 ranged attack. (Some feats, such as Manyshot , allow you to make more 
than one attack with a standard action.) If your base attack bonus 
allows you to make multiple attacks during your turn, or if you wield 
two weapons, you need to use the full-attack action (a full-round 
action) to make the multiple attacks.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
 From PH pg 150: "Cover: One of the best defenses available is cover. By
 taking cover behind a tree, a wall, the side of a wagon, or the 
battlements of a castle, you can protect yourself from attacks, 
especially ranged attacks, and also from being spotted. To determine 
whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner 
of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the 
target’s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of 
effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, 
the target has cover (+4 to AC)." </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">To make a melee attack, your target must be within reach
 (usually adjacent to you if you're a Medium creature). To make a ranged
 attack, your target must be within range. You must have line of effect 
(at least one unbroken, straight, line from any corner of your space to 
any corner of your target's space) to make a melee or ranged attack. If 
one or more of those lines is blocked, your target has cover against 
your attack. If you're making a melee attack, your target has cover if 
any line between any corner of your square and any corner of your 
target's square is blocked. If you're making a ranged attack, pick any 
corner of your square. Your target has cover only if any line connecting
 that corner with any corner of the target's space is blocked. </p>
<p align="left"> Remember that a natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on the 
attack roll is always a miss, no matter what your attack bonus or what 
your target's Armor Class. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a
 hit, provided that you have line of effect to your target and your 
target is in reach (for a melee attack) or range (for a ranged attack).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2005%20-%2006-28%20-%20Actions%20%28Part%203%29_files/rg_coverdiagram.jpg" border="0" height="345" width="545"></p>
<p align="left">If you make a ranged attack at a target engaged in melee
 with a character friendly to you, you take a -4 penalty on your attack 
roll. Two creatures are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each 
other and either threatens the other. In this case, it's best to assume 
one creature threatens the other if it can make an armed or an unarmed 
melee attack against the other. (As noted earlier, you must be able to 
make an armed melee attack into a space to threaten that space.) A 
creature that cannot make any attacks is not considered engaged unless a
 foe is actually attacking it. In this case, a creature is being 
attacked when a foe has attacked during the current or previous round.</p>
<p align="left">If you have the Precise Shot feat, you can shoot or throw into a melee without the -4 penalty.</p>
<p align="left">If your target (or the part of the target you're aiming 
at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest 
friendly character, you can avoid the -4 penalty, even if the creature 
you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character. That's 
because you can easily aim your shot to avoid hitting your ally.</p>
<p align="left">If your attack succeeds, you deal damage and might inflict a critical hit as noted on page 139 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i></p>
<p align="left">As a nonaction while attacking, you can choose to fight defensively as noted on page 140 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i></p>
<p align="left">Making an armed melee attack doesn't provoke attacks of 
opportunity. An unarmed melee attack provokes an attack of opportunity 
from your target if the target is armed. (A character could be 
considered armed even when she attacks without a weapon; see page 139 in
 the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>) A ranged attack provokes an attack of opportunity from every foe that threatens you when you make the attack.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Cast a Spell:</b> Most spells require one standard action to cast. To cast any spell, you must provide any components the spell requires. See <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a></i> for details. Casting a spell usually provokes an attack of opportunity from every foe that threatens you when you cast.</p>
<p align="left">As a nonaction, you can make a Concentration check to 
cast a spell defensively. Doing so allows you to cast the spell without 
provoking attacks of opportunity, but you must succeed at the 
Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell. Other 
conditions, such as poor weather, continuing damage, or hostile spells 
also can break your concentration; see the Concentration skill 
description in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details. </p>
<p align="left">If you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can touch
 one recipient as a nonaction that's part of the action you used to cast
 the spell. You also can opt to hold the charge for a spell with touch 
range. Though you can lose the charge by accident, you must use a 
standard action to deliver the spell where you want it. As a full-round 
action, you can touch up to six friends with a touch spell, but that's 
worthwhile with only a few spells. See <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040727a">Rules of the Game: Reading Spell Descriptions</a></i> for details.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Concentrate to Maintain a Spell: </b>Some spells 
require continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to 
maintain a spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, but anything 
that could break your concentration when casting a spell can keep you 
from concentrating to maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, 
the spell ends.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, you'll need to perform some other action to 
get the benefit from your spell. In most cases this is a nonaction 
that's part of the standard action you use to concentrate on the spell; 
an example is making a Spellcraft check to determine the school of a 
magical aura you've discovered with a <i>detect magic</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Activate a Magic Item:</b> Many magic items don't 
need to be activated, either because they work continuously or activate 
on their own when you use them; see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20041109a">Rules of the Game: Using Magic Items</a></i>.
 You use a standard action to activate most items that require 
activation. As noted in Part One, making a Use Magic Device skill check 
to help activate magic item is a nonaction you use as part of activating
 the item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Use Special Ability:</b> Using a special ability is 
usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard action, a 
full-round action, or not an action at all is defined by the ability.</p>
<p align="left">A spell-like ability requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity; see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040413a">Rules of the Game: All About Spell-Like Abilities</a></i> for details.</p>
<p align="left">A supernatural ability usually requires a standard 
action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, though sometimes 
using a supernatural ability is a nonaction or simply works when the 
user takes some other action. For example, energy drain works when the 
user makes a successful slam (or incorporeal touch) attack.</p>
<p align="left">Using an extraordinary ability is usually not an action 
because most extraordinary abilities automatically happen when the user 
takes some other action. Those extraordinary abilities that are actions 
are usually standard actions that cannot be disrupted, do not require 
concentration, and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
 From PH pg 142: "Total Defense: You can defend yourself as a standard 
action. You get a +4 dodge bonus to your AC for 1 round. Your AC 
improves at the start of this action, so it helps you against any 
attacks of opportunity you incur during the round. You can't combine 
total defense with fighting defensively or with the benefit of the 
Combat Expertise feat (since both of those require you to declare an 
attack or full attack). You can't make attacks of opportunity while 
using total defense." </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Total Defense:</b> This standard action gives you a dodge bonus to your Armor Class for 1 round; see page 142 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 for details. The bonus lasts from the moment you declare the total 
defense action until the beginning of your next turn. You can use a move
 action either before or after you declare the action, but you're better
 off if you declare the action, then use a move action (because you get 
the benefit of total defense against any attacks of opportunity provoked
 by your move action).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Start or Complete a Full-Round Action</b>: This 
standard action lets you start a full-round action and finish it the 
following round by using another standard action. You can't use this 
action to start or complete a full attack, charge, run, or withdraw. You
 can use this action to begin or complete a spell with a full-round 
casting time, to perform a coup de grace, or to begin or complete moving
 5 feet through difficult terrain (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i>.
 As with any other standard action, you can use a move action either 
before or after starting or completing the full-round action (provided 
you have both a standard action and move action available during your 
turn). If you use this action to start a full-round action and fail to 
use another standard action to complete the full-round during the 
following turn, your previous standard action is wasted.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Move Actions</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted in Part One, a move action either moves you 
across the battlefield a distance equal to your speed (or less) or is 
something that takes a similar amount of time.</p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, you can substitute a move action for a
 standard action, but not vice versa. This allows you to use one or two 
move actions each round.</p>
<p align="left">Leaving a threatened space using a move action provokes 
an attack of opportunity, though there are ways to avoid triggering an 
attack of opportunity, such as using the Tumble skill.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Move:</b> You use this action to move up to your 
speed. If you choose to travel across the battlefield at less than your 
speed, you still use up a whole move action. This helps simplify play.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Accelerated Climbing:</b> You can climb up to 
one-half your speed as a move action by accepting a -5 penalty on your 
Climb check. All the normal risks and penalties involved in climbing 
apply to accelerated<b></b>climbing; see the Climb skill description in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Crawling:</b> You can crawl 5 feet as a move action. 
Crawling incurs attacks of opportunity from any attackers who threaten 
you at any point of your crawl. This means that you trigger an attack of
 opportunity when you enter or leave a threatened space by crawling.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Drawing or Sheathing a Weapon:</b> Drawing a weapon 
so that you can use it in combat, or putting it away so that you have a 
free hand, usually is a move action. If you have a base attack bonus of 
+1 or higher, drawing (but not sheathing) a weapon is a nonaction that 
you can take along with a regular move (that is, a move action that you 
use to move up to your speed across the battlefield). If you have the 
Two-Weapon Fighting feat, you can draw two weapons (either light or 
one-handed weapons) either as a move action or as a nonaction along with
 a regular move.</p>
<p align="left">The draw a weapon action (and nonaction) also applies to
 weaponlike objects carried in easy reach. The rules don't give much 
guidance about which objects are "weaponlike," other than to use a wand 
as an example. As a practical matter, I suggest treating any object that
 is no bigger than a weapon for the character as weaponlike for this 
purpose. To be retrieved as a weapon, the weaponlike object also has to 
be stored in some convenient place, such as a sheath or loop in a belt 
or on some kind of harness or bandoleer.</p>
<p align="left">Drawing ammunition for use with a ranged weapon (such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, or shuriken) is a free action.</p>
<p align="left">The Quick Draw feat allows you to draw (but not sheathe)
 a weapon as a free action during your turn. If you also have the 
Two-Weapon Fighting feat, you can draw two weapons as a free action 
during your turn. Though the rules don't say so, it is reasonable to 
assume that you also can use Quick Draw to draw weaponlike objects.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Readying or Loosing a Shield:</b> Strapping a shield 
to your arm to gain its shield bonus to your Armor Class is a move 
action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The rules don't 
specifically say so, but to ready a shield as a move action you must 
carry it on your person (perhaps strapped to your back). If you pick up a
 shield off the ground, that takes a separate move action that provokes 
an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left">Unstrapping and dropping a shield so you can use your 
shield hand for another purpose requires a move action that does not 
provoke an attack of opportunity (to unstrap it) and a free action (to 
drop it). You also can merely loose the shield and keep it on your 
person, usually by slinging it over your back by a strap.</p>
<p align="left">If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can ready or loose a shield as a free action combined with a regular move.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Manipulating an Item:</b> Moving, lifting, storing, retrieving, or otherwise handling an item is a move action. See Table 8-2 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for variations on this action and which variations provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Directing an Existing Spell: </b>Some spells, such as <i>flaming sphere, </i>allow
 you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas while the spell 
lasts. Directing a spell requires a move action and does not provoke 
attacks of opportunity or require concentration.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Standing Up:</b> When you're prone (lying down), standing up requires a move action and provokes attacks of opportunity.<i></i>See<i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i> for variations on standing up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mounting or Dismounting a Steed: </b>You can mount or
 get off a steed no more than one size category bigger than you as a 
move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. With a DC 20
 Ride check, you can mount or dismount a steed no more than one size 
category bigger than you as a free action, provided that you have at 
least one move action available to you during the current turn at the 
time you attempt the mount or dismount. For example, if you ride your 
mount for a double move, you've exhausted your move actions for the 
round and cannot dismount during the same round, even with a Ride check.
 See the Ride skill description in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> or <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20040608a">Rules of the Game: All About Movement</a></i> for more on mounting and dismounting.</p>
