<p align="left"><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">Player characters</a> in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game often go looking for trouble and, more often than not, they find 
it. When trouble arises, combat is sure to follow. The action during a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a> of battle in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game takes place more or less simultaneously; however, resolving 
everyone's activities at the same time isn't too practical, so everybody
 must take turns. That's where <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiative')">initiative</a> comes in.</p>
<p align="left">Initiative doesn't pose too many difficulties for players and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DMs</a>.
 Nevertheless, situations often arise that can make even something as 
simple as initiative seem hopelessly confusing. These series examines 
those times when the action in a <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign makes the initiative rules break down.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Initiative Basics</b></p>
<p align="left">A complete tour of the initiative rules requires several stops. Pages 136-137 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> cover initiative fundamentals. The descriptions of special initiative actions, which begin on page 160 in the <i>Player's Handbook,</i>
 add considerable depth and complexity to the initiative rules. The 
rules for starting and running an encounter on pages 22-24 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> include additional information on initiative. A look at the introduction to <b>D&amp;D</b> combat on page 133 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the general information on acting during combat on page 138 also would prove helpful in understanding initiative.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the page 136-137 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Initiative</b></p>
<p align="left">Every round, each combatant gets to do something. The 
combatants' initiative checks, from highest to lowest, determine the 
order in which they act.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Initiative Checks:</b> At the start of a battle, each
 combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check is a Dexterity
 check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity modifier to the 
roll. The DM finds out what order characters are acting in, counting 
down from highest result to lowest, and each character acts in turn. In 
every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a
 character takes an action that results in his or her initiative 
changing; see Special Initiative Actions, page 160). Usually, the DM 
writes the names of the characters down in initiative order so that on 
subsequent rounds he can move quickly from one character to the next. If
 two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the 
combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier 
(highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should 
roll again to determine which one of them goes before the other.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Monster Initiative:</b> Typically, the DM makes a 
single initiative check for monsters and other opponents. That way, each
 player gets a turn each round and the DM also gets one turn. At the 
DM's option, however, he can make separate initiative checks for 
different groups of monsters or even for individual creatures. For 
instance, the DM may make one initiative check for an evil cleric of 
Nerull and another check for all seven of her zombie guards.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Flat-Footed:</b> At the start of a battle, before you
 have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn 
in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can't use your 
Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. (This fact can be very
 bad for you if you're attacked by rogues.) Barbarians and rogues have 
the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid 
losing their Dexterity bonus to AC due to being flat-footed. A 
flat-footed character can't make attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inaction: </b>Even if you can't take actions (for 
instance, if you become paralyzed or unconscious), you retain your 
initiative score for the duration of the encounter. For example, when 
paralyzed by a ghoul, you may miss one or more actions, but once the 
cleric casts <i>remove paralysis </i>on you, you may act again on your next turn.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Surprise</b></p>
<p align="left">When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you're surprised.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Determining Awareness</b></p>
<p align="left">Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of 
their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some of them 
are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other 
combatants on each side are unaware.</p>
<p align="left">The DM determines who is aware of whom at the start of a
 battle. He may call for Listen checks, Spot checks, or other checks to 
see how aware the adventurers are of their opponents. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Surprise Round:</b> If some but not all of the 
combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before
 regular rounds begin. Any combatants aware of the opponents can act in 
the surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative order 
(highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their 
opponents each take a standard action during the surprise round (see 
Standard Actions, page 139). You can also take free actions during the 
surprise round, at the DM's discretion. If no one or everyone is 
surprised, no surprise round occurs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Unaware Combatants:</b> Combatants who are unaware at
 the start of battle don't get to act in the surprise round. Unaware 
combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they lose
 any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>

<p align="left">Here's an overview of the initiative rules and some key concepts relating to initiative:</p>
<ul>
<li> Combat in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game takes place in rounds 6 seconds long.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The initiative rules exist to make sure that everyone 
involved in a battle gets a chance to act once during each round of 
combat. A round remains 6 seconds long no matter how many combatants 
become involved in a battle. This is possible because, as noted earlier,
 everyone who acts in a round is assumed to act more or less 
simultaneously.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_initiativecheck')">Initiative checks</a> determine the order in which combatants' actions are resolved during a round. Once the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DM</a> establishes an initiative order for a battle, there's very little that can change it.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As noted on page 136 in the <i>Player's Handbook, </i>an initiative check is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> check. Few other things can affect an initiative check. Feats such as Improved Initiative can improve your initiative <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_bonus')">bonus</a>.
 Any improvement or impairment to your Dexterity score that is in effect
 when the battle begins affects your initiative for that battle. If your
 Dexterity score changes during the battle, your initiative result 
doesn't change. For example, if you receive a <i>cat's grace</i><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a>
 before a battle begins, you get the benefit of the improvement to your 
Dexterity score when you make your initiative check for that battle. If a
 foe dispels your <i>cat's grace</i> spell after the battle begins, your
 Dexterity score decreases appropriately, but your initiative number 
doesn't change as the result of the decrease.</p>
<p align="left">The initiative order in a battle isn't completely set in
 stone, however. The ready and delay actions both have the potential to 
change a combatant's place in the order (and they usually do). Part 
Three considers these actions in more detail.</p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, one pass through the initiative order 
constitutes one 6-second round. One could say that a round of combat 
begins just before the combatant with the highest initiative number acts
 and ends just after the combatant with the lowest initiative number 
acts.</p>
<p align="left">Despite the foregoing, remember that the term "round" 
can be relative. It can refer to one complete initiative cycle, or it 
can refer to the period of time between one combatant's turn and that 
combatant's next turn.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left"><b>From the page 138 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</b></p>
<p align="left">Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world. At 
the table, a round presents an opportunity for each character involved 
in a combat situation to take an action. Anything a person could 
reasonably do in 6 seconds, your character can do in 1 round.</p>
<p align="left">Each round's activity begins with the character with the
 highest initiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each
 round of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a character's 
turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs his 
entire round's worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks of 
Opportunity, page 137, and Special Initiative Actions, page 160.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Combatants make initiative checks when the DM decides that an encounter has begun or has the potential to begin.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The rules leave identifying an encounter's start to the 
DM's good judgment. As a rule of thumb, however, an encounter begins 
when two groups are close enough to each other to perceive each other 
and at least one of the two groups has done so. As we shall see in Part 
Two, it is sometimes best to call for initiative when a group's meeting 
is merely imminent, such as when a party opens a door in an unexplored 
dungeon. In any case, it's usually best to call for initiative checks 
whenever you find that establishing an initiative order might prove 
helpful. For example, establishing an initiative order could prove 
useful during an encounter in which several different <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_creature')">creatures</a> are trying to deal with a series of traps or negotiations with several different creatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>A group (or a single <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a>) can <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_surprise')">surprise</a> a potential foe by noticing that foe before the foe can notice them.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">When one group surprises another, a surprise round 
ensues. During a surprise round, the character or group that has 
achieved surprise can take one <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_standardaction')">standard action</a>. Creatures that have been surprised cannot act during a surprise round.</p>
<p align="left">At times, some creatures in a group will notice a foe 
when the others do not. In such cases, an encounter still begins with a 
surprise round, but everyone who has noticed the other group gets to act
 during the surprise round, though the acting creatures still are 
limited to one standard action each.</p>
<ul>
<li> Combatants remain in initiative order until the DM decides that it 
is no longer necessary. Releasing characters from the initiative order 
usually marks an encounter's end.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">It's usually a good idea to keep characters in 
initiative order until all danger to them (at least from the current 
encounter) is past. Players might pick up on this, so sometimes you may 
want to keep using an initiative order for a little longer than strictly
 necessary just to maintain a sense of danger and tension in the game. 
Once a party has dealt with the challenges and obstacles an encounter 
offers, however, you'll probably find that maintaining an initiative 
order slows things down. For example, after the party defeats a group of
 monsters in an encounter they'll probably want to distribute some 
healing magic among the player characters, loot their defeated foes, and
 look for treasure. It's usually best to simply allow the players to 
handle those tasks outside of the initiative order.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, it's not entirely clear just when actions in 
initiative should stop. We'll consider some of those situations in Part 
Three.</p>
<ul>
<li>All combatants roll once for initiative when the DM decides an encounter has begun.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The rules don't allow you to "take 20" or even "take 10"
 on an initiative check. Your initiative check result initially 
represents your character's ability to react when an encounter begins. 
(That's why characters are <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_flatfooted')">flat-footed</a>
 until they take an action in an encounter's first round.) You have only
 one chance for an initial reaction to an encounter, and the rules don't
 allow you to prepare yourself for an encounter when you don't know it's
 coming.</p>
<p align="left">If you're fortunate enough to notice potential foes 
before they notice you, you achieve surprise over your foe, which is a 
great advantage for you. See page 137 in the <i>Player's Handbook.</i> 
Even so, if your foe survives your initial action, you could lose your 
advantage. That's why you and your foe must make initiative checks after
 a surprise round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Managing Initiative</b></p>
<p align="left">The rules make one very valuable suggestion for any DM 
trying to handle combat smoothly and efficiently: Write down the 
initiative order. Many DMs I know keep a pad of paper or a small dry 
erase board for jotting down initiative. This is a great idea, 
especially if you can prop up your writing surface when you're done -- 
if you do so, everyone can see the initiative order and will know when 
their turns come. I use a particularly large vinyl mat (marked in 1-inch
 squares) to regulate combat and I jot the initiative right on the mat.</p>
<p align="left">I also use another trick. When preparing for a game, I 
jot down the game statistics for everything the PCs will meet onto index
 cards. I also have each player record key information about their 
characters (<a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_abilityscore')">ability scores</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a>, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_baseattackbonus')">base attack</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_grappling')">grapple</a> bonuses, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_savingthrow')">saving throw</a>
 bonuses, and key skill scores) on index cards as well. When an 
encounter starts, I place all the cards into initiative order. When 
someone delays or readies an action, I can remove the appropriate card 
from the order and place it back in the correct place when the combatant
 finally acts. If I happen to drop or somehow scramble the cards, I can 
easily reset the cards by referring to the written initiative order, and
 the players also have the written order for reference.</p>
<p align="left">I find this method well worth the effort it entails. One of the biggest advantages of the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game's initiative system is its potential to speed up combat, and the 
combination of cards and a written initiative can make things speedy 
indeed.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That's all the time we have this week. Next week, we'll consider the fine art of deciding just when an encounter begins.</p>
