<p align="left">Last time, we took a quick tour of spell schools, 
subschools, and descriptors. This week, we move on to spell levels and 
components.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Level</b></p>
<p align="left">The third entry in a spell header shows the spell's 
level, which rates the spell's power relative to other spells. A spell's
 level can vary depending on who's casting the spell, if so, that is 
shown here. For example, <i>dominate person </i>is a 4th-level spell for bard, but a 5th-level spell for a sorcerer or wizard. </p>
<p align="left">When an interaction between two spells depends on the spell's levels, use whatever level the caster is using. For example, <i>globe of invulnerability</i> excludes spell effects of 4th level or lower. The globe would exclude a <i>dominate person </i>spell from a bard, but not from a sorcerer or wizard.</p>
<p align="left">If you don't know the spell's level, you usually can 
figure it out. For example, spell-like abilities usually use a spell's 
sorcerer/wizard spell levels (see page 315 in the <i>Monster Manual,</i>
 or Rules of the Game: All About Spell-like Abilities, Part Three). If a
 spell comes from a magical device, you can infer the spell level from 
the item's market price, as noted in Chapter 8 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i> Failing that, the methods you use for determining a spell-like ability's level also work for a magic item.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Components</b></p>
<p align="left"> The fourth entry in a spell header shows the components
 that the spell requires. Most of the time, a spell's components do not 
affect play very much. Occasionally, however, they can become critical. 
Here's an overview.</p>
<ul>
<li> Verbal (V): You must be able to speak in a strong voice to complete
 a verbal component. If you're gagged, you can't complete a verbal 
component. If a foe grapples you and pins you, you cannot speak (and 
thus cannot complete a verbal component) unless your foe allows you to 
speak.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Silence spells keep you from using verbal components.</p>
<p align="left">If you've been deafened, any spell you cast has a 20% 
failure chance if it has a verbal component. If you already have a 
failure chance from armor or a shield, you must check each failure 
chance separately.</p>
<ul>
<li> Somatic (S): You must have at least one hand free to complete a 
somatic component. The rules don't go into any detail about when you 
have a hand "free," but here are some general guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Your hand is free when you aren't carrying a weapon, a 
piece of equipment, or (usually) a shield. You can strap a buckler to 
your arm and use your hand to wield a weapon (albeit at a penalty), so 
there's no reason you couldn't use your buckler hand for a somatic 
component. The buckler might interfere a little bit, but that's what the
 arcane spell failure chance for the buckler is for. You also can strap a
 light shield to your forearm and still carry items in that hand, but 
you can't use the hand for anything else (such as wielding a weapon), so
 there's no good reason you should be able to use that hand to complete a
 somatic component. Since manipulating a material component (including a
 focus) is part of casting the spell, it's best to consider the hand 
that holds the material component or focus as "free" for purposes of 
completing a somatic component.</p>
<p align="left">You cannot cast a spell with a somatic component if 
you're grappling (either when you're the attacker in the grapple or the 
defender), when you're pinned, or when you're immobilized in some way 
(such as when you're tied up).</p>
<ul>
<li> Material (M): Although the rules don't mention it, common sense 
dictates that you must have a hand free to manipulate a material 
component for a spell (see the notes on somatic components, above).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">When you're grappling, you can try to cast a spell with a
 material component (but not with a somatic component) provided you have
 the material component in your hand when you begin the spell. If you 
don't have the material component in hand, you must first use a 
full-round action to get it. Since you used a full-round action to 
retrieve the component, you can't cast the spell until your next turn. 
You can't cast a spell with a material component if you're pinned.</p>
<p align="left">Most material components have a negligible cost and 
they're assumed to be part of your spell component pouch. If you lose 
that pouch you're pretty much out of luck for casting spells with 
material components unless you can talk your DM into letting you forage 
for them or shop for them separately.</p>
<p align="left">Here's an unofficial rule for foraging: Make a Survival 
check (DC 10) in much the same manner you'd forage for supplies (see the
 Survival skill description). On a successful check you find one 
component. If your check result exceeds 10, you find one additional 
component for every 2 points your check result exceeds 10. If you have 5
 or more ranks of Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana), you get a +2 bonus 
on the check (or +4 if you have 5 or more ranks in each skill). You can 
obtain spell components of only negligible cost by foraging.</p>
<p align="left">If you are in some locale where you can shop for spell 
components, you probably can buy a new spell component pouch. If that's 
not possible, you can shop for components using the same method 
described above, but a Gather Information check makes more sense than a 
Survival check.</p>
<p align="left">Some material components are valuable enough to have a 
cost listed in the spell description. Such material components are never
 included in a spell component pouch, and you must buy them separately 
(though there is no reason why you could not store them in a spell 
component pouch after you've bought them).</p>
<p align="left">No matter what a material component costs, you use it up
 when you cast a spell with it. The component is expended even if the 
spell fails for some reason (such as being disrupted while casting, 
missing a spell failure chance, or whatever).</p>
<p align="left">A spell component pouch effectively has an unlimited 
supply of material components for your own spells (but only material 
components with negligible cost). In effect, you are assumed to refill 
your pouch just by poking around in your spare time. When you use a 
material component that has a cash value, you'll need to buy a 
replacement before you can cast the spell again.</p>
<p align="left">Although it's not mentioned in the rules, two or more 
spellcasters can share a spell component pouch. As an unofficial rule of
 thumb, you can assume that a character's pouch holds enough of any 
particular material component each day to cast that spell twice as many 
times as the caster can cast spells of that level. For example, a 
1st-level wizard with an Intelligence score of 15 has a pouch that 
contains enough material components to cast any particular 1st-level 
spell four times a day. If the character shares his spell component 
pouch, he could easily run out of components for the day. Keep in mind 
that this is an off-the-cuff rule to cover a fairly unlikely situation. 
It's not intended as a way for stingy PCs to wiggle out of paying a 
measly 5 gp for a spell component pouch. DMs should free to adjust it as
 necessary to suit their campaigns.</p>
<ul>
<li> Focus (F): For all intents and purposes, a focus is merely a 
material component that isn't consumed when you cast the spell. 
Everything in the section on material components also applies to focuses
 (except the part about them being consumed), with the following 
exceptions:</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If you're forced to forage for a focus with a negligible
 cost, the DC to find one is 15, and you can locate an additional focus 
with a negligible cost for every 5 points by which your check exceeds 
15.</p>
<p align="left">A spell component pouch typically contains one focus 
with a negligible cost for each spell that you know that also requires 
such a focus.</p>
<ul>
<li> Divine Focus (DF): This is simply a focus that has some spiritual 
significance for you. Usually it's your holy symbol. Divine focuses 
aren't included in spell component pouches.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> In some cases, the arcane version of a spell will have a
 material component or a focus and the divine version will have a divine
 focus. In that case, the two differing components are listed and 
separated by a slash; for example M/DF. See page 173 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for details.</p>
<ul>
<li> XP Cost (XP): When you cast a spell with an XP cost, you pay that 
cost when you cast the spell, even if the spell fails for some reason, 
and your experience total is immediately reduced. According to the 
rules, you can never spend so much experience that you lose a level -- 
though you can delay gaining a level and instead keep your experience 
points available for spellcasting (or item creation). If you do so, you 
always can change your mind. That is, you can gain a new level any time 
you have enough experience to do so, even after delaying awhile. For 
example, suppose you're a 9th-level cleric, which gives you access to 
the <i>commune</i> spell, which has an XP cost of 100 XP. Your current 
XP total is 45,052. You have enough experience to become a 10th-level 
character, but if you do you won't be able to cast your <i>commune</i> 
spell because doing so would reduce your experience total to 44,952 and 
you'd drop back to 9th level. You can choose to delay becoming a 
10th-level character until your experience total is 45,100 gp or more. 
Once you pass that milestone, you can add a character level. Once you 
make the decision to add the level, however, you're bound to the rule 
preventing you from spending so much XP that you lose a level.</li>
</ul>
