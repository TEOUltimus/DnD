<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top" width="100%">
<p align="left">Most difficulties with magic items arise from questions 
about just what a wielder has to do to use an item and exactly how often
 the user can use it. In Part One, we considered kinds of magic items in
 general and how you use them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Activating Magic Items </b></p>
<p align="left">Pages 211-215 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>explain item activation in detail, and the introductory text for the various kinds of items in Chapter 7 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>contains additional information. This section summarizes that material and offers some additional remarks.</p>
<p align="left">Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the 
item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a 
spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, 
regardless of the kind of magic item or its activation method, unless 
the item description specifically states otherwise (see page 213 in the <i>Dungeon Masters Guide</i>).
 Potions (and oils) are an exception. Drinking a potion or applying an 
oil to yourself is always a standard action, no matter what the stored 
spell's casting time is. Administering a potion or oil to an unconscious
 ally is always a full-round action (see page 229 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left">When activating an item requires an action from you, you
 usually also must speak; the rules don't say so, but you reasonably can
 assume that doing so is much like completing a spell's verbal 
component. You must speak in a strong voice, and anything that keeps you
 from speaking, such as a <i>silence</i> spell or being pinned in a grapple, keeps you from activating the item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Completion:</b> This is the activation method 
for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The item user 
must complete the spell's verbal and somatic components (if it has any),
 but does not need any material, focus, or XP components the spell might
 have. (The character who scribed the scroll provided those.)</p>
<p align="left">To use a spell completion item safely, you must be of 
high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If you 
can't already cast the spell, there's a chance you'll make a mistake, as
 noted on page 238 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide. </i>To activate a 
spell trigger item with an arcane spell on it, you must have levels in a
 class able to cast arcane spells. Likewise, to activate a spell trigger
 item with a divine spell on it, you must have levels in a class able to
 cast divine spells. If you don't have enough levels in the class to 
cast any spells yet, you can still try to use a spell trigger item, but 
your effective caster level for activating the spell is 0.</p>
<p align="left">If a scroll has a caster level higher than your own, you
 have to make a Spellcraft check (DC = 1 + the scroll's caster level) to
 activate the scroll. If you fail the check, you don't activate the 
scroll and the scroll isn't used up.</p>
<p align="left">Activating a spell completion item usually is a standard
 action that provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell 
does.</p>
<p align="left">If the spell contained in a spell completion item has a 
casting time other than 1 standard action, that is its activation time. 
For example, a scroll containing a<i> summon monster I </i>spell has an activation time of 1 round because that's the casting time for the spell.</p>
<p align="left">The rules don't say so (probably because it's an obvious
 point), but you must be able to see a scroll to read it. If you're 
blinded, you can't activate a scroll, and you also cannot do so if 
darkness, fog, or some other condition keeps you from seeing the scroll.
 Darkvision lets you see in nonmagical darkness, and that allows you to 
read scrolls in nonmagical darkness.</p>
<p align="left">Whenever you activate a scroll, you still need to make 
any Concentration checks you'd normally need to make to cast a spell, 
and the spell on the scroll is wasted if you fail the check. For 
example, if you're damaged while activating a scroll, you must make 
Concentration check to cast the spell. You can activate a spell 
completion item defensively; the required Concentration check DC is the 
same as the DC to cast the spell. If you fail the check, the spell is 
wasted.</p>
<p align="left">Spell completion items are also subject to arcane spell 
failure if you use them while armored. If you fail an arcane spell 
failure roll while using a spell completion item, the spell is wasted.</p>
<p align="left">You cant activate a spell completion item if the spell 
stored in the item isnt on your class spell list or if your ability 
scores would not allow you to cast the stored spell. For example, a 
single-classed bard cannot cast a <i>fireball</i> spell from a scroll, because <i>fireball</i>
 isnt on the bard spell list (see the entry on spell trigger items for a
 discussion of class spell lists). Likewise, a wizard with an 
Intelligence score of 12 could not cast a <i>fireball</i> spell from a scroll because a wizard needs an Intelligence score of at least 13 to cast a 3rd-level spell. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell Trigger:</b> This is the activation method for 
wands and staffs. Activating a spell trigger item requires no gestures 
or spell finishing, but you must speak a single word, and you must hold 
the item in your hand (or what passes for your hand).</p>
<p align="left">To use a spell trigger item, you must have the spell 
that is stored in the item on your class spell list. You can use the 
item even if you're not high enough level to cast the stored spell (or 
even high enough level to cast any spells at all). It doesn't make any 
difference if the stored spell is arcane or divine, and your ability 
scores dont matter.</p>
<p align="left">See the <i>Player's Handbook</i> (or other appropriate 
rulebook) for your class spell list. If you have a prohibited school of 
spells (if you're a specialist wizard, for example), the spells from 
that school aren't part of your class spell list. If you have access to 
clerical spell domains, the spells in the domains you've chosen are on 
your class spell list (spells from domains you could have chosen, but 
did not, are not on your class spell list). If you're multiclassed, you 
can use a spell trigger item that stores a spell that is on at least one
 of your class spell lists.</p>
<p align="left">If a spell trigger item stores more than one spell (for 
example, a staff), you may find that you can use only some of the item's
 functions.</p>
<p align="left">Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action 
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the spell stored in a 
spell trigger item has a casting time other than 1 standard action, that
 is its activation time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Command Word:</b> This is the default activation 
method for rings, rods, and wondrous items when the item description 
doesn't mention another activation method. To use a command word item, 
you speak the command word and the item activates. You need no other 
special knowledge, but you must hold or wear the item as appropriate for
 that item (see Part One).</p>
<p align="left">Activating a command word magic item is a standard 
action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If a command word 
item produces a spell effect and that spell has a casting time other 
than 1 standard action, that is the item's activation time.</p>
<p align="left">A command word usually is some seemingly nonsensical 
word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common 
use. Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on 
the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design 
engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear
 a clue to the command word.</p>
<p align="left">As noted in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>, the 
Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in 
helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A
 successful check against DC 30 produces the word itself. If you fail 
that check, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some 
insight into what the word might be. For example, a successful check to 
gain insight might indicate the sort of word the command might be, such 
as an ancient word for "fire" or a rhyming couplet related to the item's
 function.</p>
<p align="left">You could possibly pick up a command word when you 
witness the item being used. I recommend a DC 15 Listen check. Subtract 5
 from the DC if the area is fairly quiet and add 5 to the DC if the area
 is very noisy (such as a typical battle). Also apply the DC modifiers 
from the Listen skill description. If you have at least 5 ranks in the 
Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) skills, you get a +2 bonus on the 
check.</p>
<p align="left">Remember that a command word item is pretty easy to use.
 These tricks won't help you figure out how to use a spell completion or
 spell trigger item.</p>
<p align="left">The spells <i>identify</i> and <i>analyze dweomer</i> both reveal command words, as noted in the spell descriptions.</p>
<p align="left">Some command-activated items use a command thought or 
other nonverbal command instead of command word (if so, the item 
description will say so). Such items work just like command word items 
in play, except that you can't make a Listen check to learn the command 
word. You might, however, pick up the command using a <i>detect thoughts</i> spell at the right moment or by making a Spot check, as appropriate for the item in question.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Use Activated:</b> You simply use this type of item 
to activate it (for example, drinking a potion, swinging a sword, 
wearing armor, looking through a lens, sprinkling dust, or donning a 
hat). As noted in Part One, most protective items, and items that give 
you some sort of bonus on attacks, saves, or checks, are use-activated 
items.</p>
<p align="left">Unless stated otherwise (and as stated in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>),
 activating a use-activated item is either a standard action or not an 
action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the 
use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity
 in itself. For example, a magic bow requires you to make a ranged 
attack, so you provoke an attack of opportunity when you make the ranged
 attack.</p>
<p align="left">If the use of the item takes time before a magical 
effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item's 
activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time, use 
activation is not an action at all.</p>
<p align="left">Use activation doesn't mean that you automatically know 
what an item can do if you use it. You must know (or at least guess) 
what the item can do and then use the item to activate it. Sometimes, 
the item activates automatically when you use it, such as when you drink
 a potion or swing a sword. In such cases, you can benefit from the item
 without even knowing it. Sometimes, you must attempt something specific
 to benefit from a use-activated item. For example, if you wear <i>gloves of</i><i>arrow snaring,</i>
 you can snatch arrows twice a day. You don't use an action to snatch 
the arrows, but unless you actually try to snatch an arrow the gloves 
don't work.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Use Magic Device Skill </b></p>
<p align="left">The Use Magic Device skill allows you to activate magic 
items even when you could not normally do so. For example, you can use 
it to activate a spell trigger item even when you don't have the spell 
it stores on your class spell list. You also can use the skill to 
activate a command item when you don't know the command or decipher the 
writing on a scroll and then activate the scroll (or other spell 
completion item) even when you otherwise could not.</p>
<p align="left">Some people think that you need the Use Magic Device 
skill to activate any item, but that's not so. The Use Magic Device 
skill merely provides a sort of last resort when you want to use an item
 that you otherwise cannot activate.</p>
<p align="left">The DC for a Use Magic Device check depends on the kind 
of item you're trying to use, as noted in the skill description. Here 
are a few additional notes for using the skill:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Blind Activation: </b>You can use the "activate 
blindly" option with any kind of item. You can even use it to activate a
 command item when you don't know the command (or even what the device 
does). If you succeed, you activate the item somehow. Successful 
activation does not necessarily reveal the command to you, but you do 
get a +2 bonus on further attempts to activate the item blindly.</p>
<p align="left">As an unofficial rule, you might allow a character who 
has activated an item blindly an immediate Knowledge check (see the 
section on command activation) with a base DC of 25. Give the character a
 cumulative circumstance bonus of +2 for each for time the character has
 previously activated the item blindly. The character gets only one 
check for each blind activation. If the character doesn't have the 
appropriate Knowledge skill, the character makes an Intelligence check 
(with the previously noted circumstance bonus) instead.</p>
<p align="left">The skill description doesn't say so, but there's no 
reason why you could not use blind activation when you don't know a 
spell trigger item's function. To use this unofficial rule, you must aim
 the item somewhere. If you aim at the wrong place, you might simply 
waste a charge from the item, or you might have a disaster on your hands
 (depending on what the item's effect is and exactly where you aimed). 
If the spell trigger item produces a visible effect, you probably can 
surmise what the spell is. Otherwise make a DC 25 Spellcraft check to 
determine what the spell is. If the effect is visible and your DM 
decides you might not know what it is, the check DC is only 20.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Decipher a Written Spell:</b><i></i>This works just 
like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that 
the DC is higher. Deciphering a written spell takes 1 minute. Remember 
that to use a scroll, you must first decipher the writing on it. Once 
you decipher the writing, you'll know what the spell is and what it does
 (at least as well as you know the spell if you had it in your spell 
book or in your personal spell repertoire).</p>
<p align="left"><b>What's Next? </b></p>
<p align="left">That covers magic item activation pretty well. Next 
week, we'll consider items with limited uses, magic items that you must 
wear, and other aspects of magic items in play.</p>
