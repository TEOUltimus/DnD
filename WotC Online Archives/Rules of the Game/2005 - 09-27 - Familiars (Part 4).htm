 week, we concluded our look at a familiar's powers and abilities, then 
considered how familiars function as creatures and just how one goes 
about acquiring a familiar in the first place. This week, we'll examine 
the challenges of protecting a familiar during combat and consider what 
happens to the surviving member of the pair when a master or familiar 
dies.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Familiars in Combat </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Most masters usually avoid physical combat, which is a 
very good idea. When you have your familiar along, it's even more 
important to stay out of harm's way. Even when you're a high-level <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">character</a>, your familiar is easy prey for any foe powerful enough to challenge you.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Perhaps the best protection you can offer your familiar 
while adventuring is to leave the familiar at home or at least in camp. 
Not only does this strategy keep the familiar safe from the perils you 
face, it also leaves a trustworthy sentinel in charge. The familiar can 
keep watch over your goods and defend them if necessary. Even if the 
familiar cannot prevent a raid on your abode, it can provide you with 
valuable information about the event (in the form of an eyewitness 
account given to the best of the familiar's ability) or even shadow the 
trespassers back to their base.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you remain within a mile of your familiar, you can 
get instant warning about any trouble thanks to the empathic link 
between master and familiar. Due to the limited nature of the link (see 
Part Two), you'll need to be prepared for false alarms. If you range 
farther afield, you can use scrying to keep up to date. The familiar 
provides an easy subject for the scrying attempt, and if you are 13th 
level or higher, you can scry on the familiar once a day without 
recourse to a spell or a scrying device.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Protection from Physical Threats</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2009-27%20-%20Familiars%20%28Part%204%29_files/dxrg_familiarpocket.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="280" width="208">Even with its increased <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">Armor Class</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hitpoints')">hit points</a>, a familiar is even more vulnerable to <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_meleeattack')">melee</a> and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedattack')">ranged attacks</a> than you are. Since most familiars are size <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Tiny')">Tiny</a> or smaller, the familiar can share your space. This doesn't provide the familiar with <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_cover')">cover</a>
 or any special defense, but at least you'll be on hand to intervene if 
the familiar gets into trouble. You might want to consider letting your 
familiar use you as a mount. If it does so, it can make a Ride check to 
claim cover (+4 to Armor Class) for 1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a>. This is "soft" cover, and the familiar does not get a bonus on <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Reflexsave')">Reflex saves</a>
 while claiming cover from you. The familiar cannot attack while 
claiming cover from you, but that's usually not a problem. Remember that
 if you have the Ride skill, the familiar can use your ranks (and its <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> score) to make Ride checks<i>.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can try to conceal your familiar inside a cloak or 
big pocket. Remember, however, that even a Tiny creature can create a 
considerable bulge. (Imagine what you'd look like when trying to carry a
 cat under your shirt.) When you're carrying your familiar in this 
fashion, your foes can still attack it. Use the rules for sundering a 
carried item. The attack provokes an <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attackofopportunity')">attack of opportunity</a>
 from you if you threaten the attacker. Use the familiar's Armor Class 
and your Dexterity modifier. Because the familiar is concealed in your 
clothing, the attack against it has a 50% <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_misschance')">miss chance</a>.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left">From page 158 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>SUNDER</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can use a melee attack with a slashing or 
bludgeoning weapon to strike a weapon or shield that your opponent is 
holding. If you're attempting to sunder a weapon or shield, follow the 
steps outlined here. (Attacking held objects other than weapons or 
shields is covered below.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Step 1: Attack of Opportunity.</b> You provoke an 
attack of opportunity from the target whose weapon or shield you are 
trying to sunder. (If you have the Improved Sunder feat, you don't incur
 an attack of opportunity for making the attempt.)</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Step 2: Opposed Rolls.</b> You and the defender make 
opposed attack rolls with your respective weapons. The wielder of a 
twohanded weapon on a sunder attempt gets a +4 bonus on this roll, and 
the wielder of a light weapon takes a -4 penalty. If the combatants are 
of different sizes, the larger combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll
 of +4 per difference in size category.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Step 3: Consequences. </b>If you beat the defender, 
you have landed a good blow. Roll damage and deal it to the weapon or 
shield. See Table 8-8: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit
 Points to determine how much damage you must deal to destroy the weapon
 or shield.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you fail the sunder attempt, you don't deal any damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Sundering a Carried or Worn Object: </i>You don't use
 an opposed attack roll to damage a carried or worn object. Instead, 
just make an attack roll against the object's AC. A carried or worn 
object's AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier + the Dexterity modifier 
of the carrying or wearing character. Attacking a carried or worn object
 provokes an attack of opportunity just as attacking a held object does.
 To attempt to snatch away an item worn by a defender (such as a cloak 
or a pair of goggles) rather than damage it, see Disarm, page 155. You 
can't sunder armor worn by another character. </p>

<p align="LEFT">A familiar concealed in your clothing is still subject 
to magical attacks, including area attacks that affect you. Normally 
things you carry aren't affected by area attacks unless you roll a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_natural')">natural</a> 1 on your saving throw (see page 177 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>); however, a familiar is a creature, not just a piece of equipment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">You also can carry a box or other container where the 
familiar can hide and claim total cover against all forms of attack. The
 table below gives statistics for such familiar carriers. All these 
carriers have latches inside and out that the familiar can operate. It 
takes the familiar a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_moveaction')">move action</a> to enter or leave the carrier.</p>

<p align="LEFT">1 A carrier's size as an object is the same as the size of the familiar for which it is made.<br> 2 For an extra cost a carrier can be made airtight and watertight; see below.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A familiar carrier has a handle and straps so it can be 
carried in the hand or strapped to the back. For an extra 20% of the 
base cost (or an extra 10 gp, whichever is higher), a carrier can be 
airtight and watertight. A familiar sealed inside such a carrier can 
breathe for 30 minutes before suffering the effects of suffocation.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The careful master also provides his familiar with 
defensive magic. The ability to share spells makes this easy to do. 
Spells such as <i>blink, blur, displacement, mage armor, </i>and <i>mirror image</i>
 provide protection for both you and your familiar. You can get double 
duty from most of these spells by casting them on yourself and sharing 
them with your familiar (see Part Two). If you plan to have your 
familiar operate more than 5 feet away from you, however, it's best to 
simply cast these spells on your familiar. Remember that you can cast a 
spell with a target entry of "you" on your familiar instead of on 
yourself (see Part Two).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Protection from Magical Threats</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Area spells probably are the biggest threats to a 
familiar's long-term survival. Fortunately, most area spells allow 
Reflex saving throws for half <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_damage')">damage</a>,
 and a familiar's improved evasion ability often allows the familiar to 
escape damage from an area spell altogether with a successful save and 
take only half damage even if it fails its save.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unfortunately, a failed save can still be deadly to a 
familiar because it does not have very many hit points. Anything that 
improves the familiar's Reflex saves improves its chance to survive. 
Some cover (see the previous section on physical threats) grants the 
familiar a +2 bonus on Reflex saves, so keep your familiar close by 
unless you have good reason to have it elsewhere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Spells that provide protection from attacks provide good protection against your familiar's occasional failed Reflex save. <i>Protection from energy </i>can
 be very effective in this regard, but you have to correctly guess what 
types of attacks you will encounter. Fortunately, this spell can be 
shared. If you expect a prolonged battle, you would do well to cast <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i> or <i>globe of invulnerability</i>.
 These spells create immobile spheres that exclude hostile spell effects
 while allowing you to cast your own spells without hindrance. Of 
course, if you or the familiar has to move, the protection is lost, but 
the spells are very effective so long as you can afford to stand your 
ground.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Effects that fill an area or affect multiple targets, 
but do not allow Reflex saves, are particularly dangerous to familiars, 
and there are more of these than you might think: <i>acid fog, cloudkill, horrid wilting, sound burst, shout, magic missile,</i> the various <i>power word </i>spells, and <i>wail of the banshee</i>,
 just to name a few. Many of these spells are high level, so you 
probably don't need to worry about them too much -- at least not right 
away. On the other hand, if you do have to face them, otherwise reliable
 defenses won't be effective. For example, <i>minor globe of invulnerability</i> cannot stop spells higher than 3rd level, and spells such as <i>protection from energy </i>won't stop <i>horrid wilting</i>. One defensive spell that offers some protection is <i>spell resistance</i>, which is worth casting even if your familiar already has <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spellresistance')">spell resistance</a>
 (because the spell probably provides better spell resistance than your 
familiar has). Best of all, you and your familiar can share the<i> spell resistance s</i>pell. If you know what spells you'll face, getting the party cleric to cast <i>spell immunity</i> or <i>greater spell immunity </i>on your familiar can be very effective, as can casting <i>protection from spells.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">You will occasionally encounter foes who employ spells such as <i>magic missile, charm monster</i>, or <i>finger of death</i> to attack your familiar directly<i>.</i> It can be difficult to defend against these assaults, but the tips in the previous paragraph are effective here, too.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Having your familiar charmed can be most inconvenient, 
but it need not be a disaster. Any time your familiar makes a successful
 save against a charm or compulsion spell (or against any other spell 
without a visible effect), you'll know it if the familiar is within one 
mile -- the hostile force or tingle that it felt when making the 
successful save can be communicated over the empathic link. If your 
familiar fails a save against a charm or compulsion effect, you'll 
immediately know something is wrong if you're within one mile (the 
change in the familiar's thinking is detectable through the empathic 
link). There's little you can do if your familiar falls under a 
compulsion effect. If the familiar is within reach, you can try to grab 
it and hold on before it can hurt itself or do something you don't like.
 Or you can try to dispel the effect. Charm effects are easier to deal 
with. If someone charms your familiar and you give the familiar a 
contradictory order, the familiar gets a new saving throw (provided the 
spell affecting the familiar allows a new save when the subject is 
ordered to do something that's against its nature). Sometimes, a master 
will wish to be rid of a familiar, usually because the familiar has 
suffered some debilitating injury or because the master simply wishes to
 acquire a new familiar. To dismiss a familiar, the master simply wills 
it so, though breaking the link that binds the two is a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fullroundaction')">full-round action</a>.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dismissing a Familiar</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="290"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="LEFT"><b>From the Sorcerer Entry (<i>Player's Handbook,</i> page 54):</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, 
the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means 
he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the 
loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer's experience point 
total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar's demise or 
dismissal. For example, suppose that Hennet is a 3rd-level sorcerer with
 3,230 XP when his owl familiar is killed by a bugbear. Hennet makes a 
successful saving throw, so he loses 300 XP, dropping him below 3,000 XP
 and back to 2nd level (see the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>for rules 
for losing levels). A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for
 a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a 
character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point 
when this happy event occurs.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Immediately upon completing the dismissal, the master must succeed on a DC 15 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Fortitudesave')">Fortitude saving throw</a> to avoid losing <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_experiencepoints')">experience points</a> as noted on page 54 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.
 Immediately on being dismissed, the familiar loses all familiar 
abilities and becomes a normal creature of its kind. It suffers no other
 ill effects, except that its reduced Intelligence score most likely 
makes it unable to remember most of what it experienced as a familiar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once a master dismisses a familiar, he cannot obtain a new one for a year and a day.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Death of a Familiar</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When a familiar dies, the master must succeed on a DC 15
 Fortitude saving throw to avoid losing experience points as noted in 
page 54 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. The master cannot obtain a new 
familiar for a year and a day. Most familiars can be raised from the 
dead. (If the familiar is of the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_elementaltype')">elemental</a> or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_outsidertype')">outsider type</a>, it takes a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to bring it back from the dead.)</p>
<p align="LEFT">Bringing back the familiar from the dead reestablishes the link between master and familiar; however, the <i>reincarnate</i>
 spell is an exception. The spell brings back the familiar as an 
independent being and the resulting creature is no longer a familiar.</p>
<p align="LEFT">No matter how the familiar returns from the dead, the 
process does not erase the experience loss the master suffers. The 
familiar does not suffer any level or <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Constitution')">Constitution</a>
 loss. If the master's experience loss has reduced the master's level, 
however, the familiar's abilities are reduced accordingly.</p>

<p align="LEFT">If the master dies, and the familiar survives, it loses 
all abilities associated with being a familiar (as if it had been 
dismissed). As a house rule, you might want to delay the familiar's loss
 of abilities for a short time, say one day per level of the master.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the master is later brought back from the dead, the 
familiar has whatever abilities that go along with the master's new 
level.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Familiars and Magic Items</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A great way to both protect your familiar and perhaps 
give it some offensive power is to equip it with magic items. Consider 
purchasing items for your familiar or just give it items you no longer 
need (such as your <i>+1 ring of protection</i> when you acquire a <i>+2 ring of protection</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once you do so, however, you and your DM face a 
potentially difficult decision. Exactly which items can familiars use? 
Since most magic items fit users of any size, the simple answer is that 
it can use pretty much any item. No familiar can use an item that 
requires spell completion or spell knowledge because they are not 
spellcasters. Likewise, most familiars cannot speak, so they can't use 
command word items (the ability to speak with the master doesn't count).
 Familiars usually lack prehensile appendages, so they cannot employ 
weapons, either. What does that leave? That leaves potions (though you 
may have to open the potion vial and pour out the liquid), rings, and 
most items that can be worn or carried. Your DM may decide that your 
familiar's body type simply will not allow some items to fit your 
familiar. For example, you might persuade your DM to let your cat wear 
boots, citing the tale of "Puss in Boots" as an example, but don't count
 on your snake wearing boots. Creatures like owls and bats may have a 
have hard time with cloaks (since the garment interferes with their 
wings). All familiars have item locations similar to those found on a 
humanoid character, though the items worn there might have a 
considerably different shape. For example, a quadruped uses its back 
feet for the "foot" location and its front feet for the "hand" location.
 The hind legs correspond to a humanoid's legs and the front legs 
correspond to a humanoid's arms. For avians, treat the feet and legs as 
hands and arms and the wings as legs and feet. (If your familiar is a 
winged humanoid or winged quadruped, such as an imp or pseudodragon, its
 wings do not provide extra locations for magic items. The creature can 
wear "leg" items on its wings or hind legs, but not both.) A snake 
simply wears items over its head or body. In most cases, even if your 
familiar can't use an item you've found, it should be possible to make 
(or have made) an item your familiar can use. For example, you might 
fashion <i>wing bands of speed</i> for your bat or hawk's wings, and they would work just like <i>boots of speed </i>for your familiar.</p>
