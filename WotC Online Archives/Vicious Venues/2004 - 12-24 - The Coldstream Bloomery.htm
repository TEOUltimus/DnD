<p align="left">Once a place of bucolic charm, the woodland village of 
Coldstream now stands at the heart of a virtual wasteland of stunted 
crops and denuded hills. A pall of acrid smoke hangs over the community,
 and dusky soot clings to everything. Still Coldstream boasts a 
hardworking population of cheerful humans and halflings who labor at the
 local bloomery, or iron works, where they smelt literally tons of pig 
iron from locally mined ore.</p>
<p align="left">Is Coldstream a hellish canker on the land, or a jewel of industry?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">Some sixty years ago, the site of the Coldstream 
Bloomery was a waterfall surrounded by pristine woodland. The first 
human settler in the area was an enterprising woman who called herself 
Mertaz Forestwalker. Mertaz built herself a simple cabin and made a 
living hunting and trapping in the forest. A generation later, the 
village of Coldstream had grown up around the cabin. The village boasted
 a blacksmith's shop and a mill for grinding grain. Mertaz's heirs kept 
the village going for years, earning a modest living from the mill and 
blacksmith's shop, which the family, now calling itself Coldstream, 
owned. The current head of the Coldstream family, however, has never 
been content to be a simple country squire. Dagin Coldstream has visions
 of becoming a wealthy landowner and a true member of the nobility. He 
ordered an extensive survey of all the property his family owned and 
additional surveys of the adjacent land. Dagin was overjoyed when his 
efforts uncovered a sizeable lode of iron ore in the wooded hills near 
the village. Dagin quickly concluded that he could make much more money 
smelting iron ore than he could make grinding grain for the villagers.</p>
<p align="left">In the space of a few years, Dagin has gutted the heart 
of the village, leveling Mertaz's cabin along with the original mill and
 blacksmith's shop. In their place, Dagin has built a blast furnace two 
stories high. A quartet of massive bellows powered by a waterwheel 
supplies forced air to stoke the furnaces, and teams of sweating workers
 work around the clock to keep the furnace stoked with charcoal and iron
 ore.</p>
<p align="left">Dagin has not replaced the old grain mill, and the few 
remaining farmers in the area must grind their grain using small mills 
powered by oxen or other draft animals. Dagin owns the mills, but the 
farmers supply the grain and the animal power.</p>
<p align="left">The village, once surrounded by vigorous fields with 
lush forests beyond, now lies under a pall of smoke from the blast 
furnace. Some crops still grow in the fields surrounding the village, 
but the hills beyond have been stripped of trees to provide charcoal for
 Dagin's blast furnace. The hills have eroded, and that has left the 
area's streams filled with silt. Likewise, the fields below have dried 
out and become considerably less fertile than they once were. In the 
meantime, Dagin is busy buying up even more forested land to satisfy the
 blast furnace's hunger for charcoal. </p>
<p align="left">A few of the villagers resent the changes Dagin has 
brought about, but most are fairly pleased with their new lot in life. 
Many of the villagers now work for the bloomery in some way or another, 
either by tending the furnace or transporting supplies or finished 
goods. Dagin has brought in new workers to handle the dirtiest jobs. 
Locals who once owned wooded land have done very well because Dagin 
bought the land at prime prices.</p>
<p align="left"><b>About Dagin</b></p>
<p align="left">Dagin's thirst for material wealth drives all his 
thoughts and actions. He's not evil, but he does have a hefty dose of 
impatience and greed. To get money to fund his mine and ironworks, Dagin
 briefly turned to adventuring, where his honey tongue and guile served 
him well. A trained orator from an early age, Dagin quickly mastered the
 way of the bard.</p>

<p align="left">Dagin's chief assistant these days is a halfling, 
Griscoe Waterside. He is an old family retainer long charged with 
keeping his eyes and ears open to threats and opportunities for the 
Coldstream family. Griscoe's ancestors settled in Coldstream not long 
after Mertaz Forestwalker came there (see the Background section), and 
his family has allied itself with Mertaz's heirs ever since. Like Dagin,
 Griscoe is proud of the ironworks and pleased with his growing wealth.</p>

<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">Thanks to Dagin's efforts, traffic through the village 
of Coldstream has increased considerably in recent years, and the PCs 
might have reason to visit or pass through the village on their own 
business. Otherwise, events in or around the village might draw them to 
the site:</p>
<ul>
<li> Various woodland creatures have grown disgusted with Dagin's 
activities and have launched some kind of assault on the village. They 
might try to blockade the place, destroy the blast furnace, or do 
something else to stop Dagin. The PCs might find themselves involved on 
either side, depending on exactly who calls for their aid.<br><br></li>
<li>Dagin's workers disturb something that is best left alone. They 
might prod the tarrasque out of hibernation, disturb a dragon's long 
nap, release an undead creature from confinement, or open a <i>portal</i> to another plane (probably an elemental plane). Someone calls in the PCs to contain what has been released.<br><br></li>
<li>Dagin becomes embroiled in some kind of trade dispute. Perhaps 
Dagin's customers believe they're being overcharged, or his workers 
think they're being underpaid. Or perhaps a nearby colony of dwarves 
resents the loss of the monopoly they once had on raw iron. Or perhaps 
someone has decided to press a claim to land Dagin has recently acquired
 or is trying to acquire. The PCs might have to do some detective work 
to figure out exactly what's going on.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Bloomery (EL 6-13)</b></p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="left">These soot-smeared buildings seem like they belong on 
one of the Lower Planes. Nearby is a massive, trapezoidal stone pile as 
tall as a castle's curtain wall and at least twice as thick. Four squat 
chimneys belch forth smoke, sparks, and a nasty stench. On one side, 
four great bellows, each the size of a peasant hut, puff air into the 
structure. Together they sound like a flight of dragons, huffing and 
puffing.</p>
<p align="left">On the side opposite the bellows lies a structure that 
looks like a stone shed or cattle barn with a lean-to roof. Arched 
openings in the shed's sides give a view of the interior, which contains
 heaps of black charcoal and lumps of rust-red rock.</p>
<p align="left">At one end of the main mass lies a sandy area where 
heaps of glasslike slag lie. A network of shallow channels winds around 
the slag piles.</p>
<p align="left">Rows of sooty cottages and other buildings line the 
crooked streets around the furnace complex. Fields of stunted crops 
surround the village, and eroded hills line the horizon beyond them.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Once every few hours, laborers working in the "shed" 
load the furnace with raw iron ore and charcoal. The bellows keep the 
fire going at volcanic intensity. When a load of refined ore is ready, 
impurities rise to the top in the form of molten slag, which the workers
 can draw off by knocking stone plugs out of one end of furnace. The 
slag flows out into the channels. When it cools, workers rake it aside, 
then release molten iron into the same channels. When the iron cools, it
 forms "blooms" that give the Coldstream Bloomery its name. The 
solidified blooms are then carted off to a warehouse and eventually 
sold.</p>
<p align="left">Raw ore comes from the nearby mine. A steady stream of wagons brings in charcoal from increasingly far away. </p>
<p align="left">Dagin is proud of his operation, and visitors to the 
village can get a tour of the premises almost any time. Either Dagin or 
Griscoe shows visitors around. Use the following text if PCs approach in
 a nonthreatening manner. Dagin tends to call everyone who isn't 
intimately familiar with the bloomery a "kid," regardless of age or 
race.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Well well, visitors!" says the individual apparently in
 charge. "You kids have come to see the operation in action, eh? We're 
always busy here, but we're also very proud of our bloomery, so there's

food. Human needs are different now, and we have to keep up or get left 
behind. I don't notice many of you adventurers going around in hide 
armor and beating up your enemies with clubs. No, you wear steel armor 
and carry fancy weapons. You think you can make those things without 
cutting down a few trees? You think you can support a city without good,
 pure iron? Well, you can't. Maybe elves like to live in the trees 
sometimes, but most people don't. What we make here is needed, or there 
wouldn't be such a market for it. The world is changing, and we have to 
change with it."</p>

<p align="left"><b>Creatures:</b> About 15-20 workers (human and 
halfling, commoner, expert, or commoner/expert 1-3) are busy around the 
furnace just about any hour of the day. The workers aren't armed and 
will flee when faced with danger.</p>
<p align="left">During daylight hours, Dagin and Griscoe look in at the furnace from time to time.</p>
<p align="left">A group of wereboars provides security for the 
ironworks, and they're on duty at all hours. Dagin and Griscoe 
encountered the lycanthropes while prospecting for their iron mine. 
Dagin was quick to persuade the wereboars to join him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wereboars (2-8):</b> hp 34 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 172.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>The wereboars spend most of their time 
in human form. If trouble arises, they assume hybrid form and move in to
 attack. If Dagin or Griscoe (or both) are on hand when a fight occurs, 
Dagin uses his spells to disrupt the foes, beginning with <i>lesser confusion</i> or <i>dominate person</i>
 on the most physically dangerous foes. Griscoe sticks close to Dagin, 
but he doesn't pass up chances to use his sneak attacks, and might even 
use his Tumble skill to get into position.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dealing with Dagin</b></p>
<p align="left">Characters who object to Dagin's ruthless exploitation 
of the land around the village of Coldstream have several options for 
dealing with the problem. Simply killing Dagin is most likely the worst 
choice, because Dagin is fairly popular with his workers and with his 
customers. Anyone who kills him will become an outlaw and wanted for 
murder.</p>
<p align="left">Dagin is too proud and stubborn to be driven out of 
Coldstream or intimidated into stopping his operations. However, someone
 could help Dagin adopt practices that aren't so hard on the land. For 
example, characters might put Dagin in touch with someone who can 
harvest trees for charcoal without clear-cutting whole forests. In any 
case, Dagin won't object to efforts to restore the land around 
Coldstream to something like its former beauty. A party with a green 
thumb (and perhaps a few <i>plant growth</i> spells) could work wonders.</p>
