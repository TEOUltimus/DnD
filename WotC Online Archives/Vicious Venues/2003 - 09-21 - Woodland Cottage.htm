<p align="LEFT"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Background for the DM</span></b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 cottage is home to Erhine, a graybeard with a nose for exotic herbs and
 esoteric knowledge. In his secluded cottage, Erhine studies old tomes 
and maintains a far-flung network of contacts that spans the world and 
the planes beyond. Messengers come and go frequently, and visitors with 
new facts to impart often stay a week or two. There's no telling whom or
 what Erhine may be entertaining on any given day. Consequently, his 
cottage has acquired a reputation as a house of horrors. The old man 
makes ends meet by selling rare herbs and by serving as a sage and 
teacher. He's a stern taskmaster when it comes to learning, so much so 
that some of his less eager students readily agree that the little 
cottage is a dreadful place.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Currently,
 Erhine has a pair of reluctant students: Arietisa and Procyonai bint 
Hamalik. Arietisa and Procyonai are djinn, daughters of a djinni sheik 
of Erhine's long acquaintance. The sisters find Erhine's cottage cramped
 (a reasonable complaint for creatures of their size), and hopelessly 
rustic (a less reasonable gripe from a pair of creatures who have 
perhaps become spoiled and lazy). They think Erhine is a boring old 
fuddy-duddy (true, from their points of view).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">The Setup</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 cottage is deliberately isolated, so the PCs aren't likely to stumble 
across it by accident unless they get lost in the woods. The characters 
might be directed here, however, if they discover some old or unusual 
item that sages find difficult to identify or appraise. They also might 
be hired to deliver a message to Erhine. Parents of means could hire the
 PCs to escort one of their children to the cottage to receive an 
education, or perhaps to track down a runaway student.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Despite
 the cottage's remote location, woodcutters, hunters, elves, and other 
sylvan creatures have had ample opportunity to observe the place over 
the years, and Erhine's bizarre dealings and eccentric ways have given 
rise to many rumors and tall tales. Anyone who seeks information about 
Erhine or his dwelling might hear any of the following tales.</span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 one who calls himself Erhine is a truly wicked being who traffics in 
blood and souls, especially those of the young and innocent. It is not 
clear exactly what kind of creature this Erhine really is, but lone 
travelers would be well advised to steer clear of his dwelling. Erhine 
lives in a cottage that seems normal enough, but it's bigger on the 
inside than on the outside, and it holds untold horrors.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Erhine
 is a crazy old coot, but he's actually harmless. He spends too much 
time with plants and animals, and he'll talk your ears off if you give 
him the slightest encouragement. He's a friend to the creatures of the 
forest, however, and anyone who does him wrong doesn't stand much chance
 of ever leaving the area alive.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Erhine's
 cottage is actually an extradimensional crossroads, and Erhine is some 
sort of toll keeper and planar tour guide. You can go just about 
anywhere right from his front parlor.</span><span style=" font-size:12px; color:#800080"></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 up to you to decide which, if any, of these rumors are true. Most of 
the following sections assume that the more ominous rumors are either 
untrue or exaggerated.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px;">A First Look at the Cottage</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From
 the outside, Erhine's cottage looks like a spacious dwelling (which it 
is). The text below assumes that the time of year is early autumn. 
Adjust it as needed to reflect the time of year in your own campaign.</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 forest opens a bit here to form a glade sheltered by massive oak trees.
 A rambling cottage stands under the oaks. Its main section features 
very tall gables and lower wings on either side. The thatched roofs look
 oddly pale and shiny, as though covered with hoarfrost. Slim 
crystalline forms dangle from the eaves, looking like tiny icicles. 
That's odd, because the day seems comfortably warm.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 cottage has half-timbered walls, with shutters and a front door painted
 bright green. Though the windows are at a height appropriate for 
creatures of about human size, the front door looks massive. It's easily
 tall and wide enough to allow an ogre to enter without squeezing or 
stooping.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 thick hedge with a gate of wrought iron surrounds the cottage. The view
 through the gate shows neatly trimmed gardens filled with flowers, 
herbs, and vegetables. </span></p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 "frost" on the thatched roof is literally cake frosting. Yesterday, 
Erhine grew impatient with his two students and decided to give them a 
short break from schoolwork, suggesting they might like some fresh air. 
The sisters were happy with the change of pace, until they learned what 
Erhine had in mind. He ordered them to repair a few minor leaks in the 
cottage roof. Inwardly fuming, the djinn asked if they would be allowed 
to use their magical powers on the job. Erhine readily agreed and told 
his students they had the day for the job. If they finished early, they 
could have the rest of the day to themselves. Erhine expected the djinn 
to use their ability to create vegetable matter to fashion some new 
thatch, but instead, the sisters conjured up a big bucket of sugary 
frosting and slathered that all over the roof. The deed done, the 
sisters used their <i>plane shift</i> abilities to return to their father's court, explaining that they had the day off.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the warmth of the day, the frosting has slumped and flowed, forming the "icicles" the PCs saw from afar.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Erhine,
 who has immersed himself in some research, has yet to notice the prank.
 He'll be none too pleased with the sisters when he discovers how they 
repaired the roof. A quick <i>sending</i> spell will bring back the sisters, probably with dad in tow.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When the PCs get closer, the true condition of the roof becomes more apparent.</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There's
 a sweet scent coming from cottage, but the smell is too cloying to be 
pleasant. A thick cloud of flying insects hovers over the cottage roof. 
Thousands of buzzing wings combine to create a throbbing drone.</span></p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 gate in the hedge is unlocked, and the PCs can walk right up to the 
cottage. It's fairly easy to reach up to the cottage's eaves and get a 
sample of the roof's sticky covering.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px;"><b>Inside the Cottage</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 main section of the cottage consists of a single room that is open to 
the rafters, which are high overhead. Erhine had the room built this way
 to accommodate visitors bigger than himself. The room has a simple 
décor consisting of a stone floor, a big fireplace, and walls lined with
 overstuffed bookshelves. A long table, a pair of padded benches, and a 
pair of high divans that large visitors can use as armchairs constitute 
the room's primary furnishings. Erhine uses this room for instructing 
students and entertaining guests.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 cottage's two wings are built to human scale. One contains a kitchen, 
storage space, and a stable. The other wing houses a library, workshop, 
and study.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 14 or 15):</b>
 Erhine lives in the cottage with his wolf animal companion, Sirus, and

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animal Companion:</b> Erhine has a wolf named Sirus as his animal companion. He gains the following benefits from it. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Link (Ex):</i>
 Erhine can handle Sirus as a free action or push him as a move action. 
He gains a +4 bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks 
regarding him. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i>
 Erhine may have any spell he casts upon himself also affect Sirus if 
desired. Sirus must be within 5 feet of him at the time of casting to 
receive this benefit. If the spell has a duration other than 
instantaneous, it stops affecting Sirus if he moves more than 5 feet 
away and does not affect him again even if he returns before the 
duration expires. Erhine may also cast a spell with a target of "You" on
 Sirus (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. Erhine and Sirus 
can even share spells that do not normally affect creatures of the 
animal type.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Familiar Benefits:</b>
 Erhine has a raven familiar named Miatrix. He gains the benefits of the
 Alertness feat when she is within arm's reach. He also gains the 
following benefits.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Empathic Link (Su):</i>
 Erhine can communicate telepathically with Miatrix at a distance of up 
to 1 mile. He has the same connection to an item or a place that Miatrix
 does.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Share Spells:</b>
 Erhine can have any spell he casts on himself also affect his familiar 
if the latter is within arm's reach at the time. He can also cast a 
spell with a target of "You" on Miatrix.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Touch:</b> Miatrix can deliver touch spells for Erhine.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Lore:</b> Erhine can make a check with a +9 bonus to know legends and information regarding various topics. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Loremaster Secrets:</b> Erhine has chosen the secrets inner strength, instant mastery (Appraise), and newfound arcana. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Nature Sense:</b>
 Erhine can identify plants and animals (their species and special 
traits) with perfect accuracy. He can determine whether water is safe to
 drink or dangerous.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b>
 Erhine can make a wild empathy check to improve the attitude of an 
animal in the same way that a Diplomacy check can improve the attitude 
of a sentient being. He rolls 1d20+2, or 1d20-2 if attempting to 
influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Woodland Stride:</b>
 Erhine may move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and 
similar terrain at her normal speed and without suffering damage or 
other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are 
enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 Erhine would rather chat than fight. He can make conversation with just
 about any being. He's always hungry for information, and he can ask an 
endless stream of questions. Unfortunately, he can't resist the urge to 
interrupt when someone else is talking, so telling him anything can 
prove difficult.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 the PCs make their presence known by knocking at the door, shouting, or
 just poking around the cottage, Erhine greets them cheerily, though his
 mood quickly sours when he discovers what has happened to his roof. </span></p>

 those girls!" he cries, gazing at the sticky-sweet mess on top of his 
cottage. "Give them a simple task, and what do you get? Frosting! 'Fix 
the roof,' I said. I should have remembered how precise you have to be 
when you talk their kind. They'll do anything to crock your request." He
 pauses a moment to gather a fingerful of the frosting and taste it 
experimentally. "Not bad, but they could at least have made it 
chocolate," he says. "I'll fix their wagons, never fear."</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Erhine quickly excuses himself and fires off a <i>sending</i> to the Plane of Air. Arietisa and Procyonai return in a few minutes.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If threatened, Erhine tries to flee, and he uses his spells and magic items to discourage pursuit. He usually begins with <i>color spray</i> or <i>fear</i> spell. If necessary, he uses Sirus and Miatrix to block or delay his foes. He uses a <i>sending</i>
 to call the Plane of Air for help at the first opportunity. His allies 
there quickly send a force of eight djinn to help out. Half of any djinn
 called to fight on Erhine's behalf make use of their whirlwind 
abilities, while the other half move in for melee attacks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Development: </b>If
 the PCs part amicably with Erhine, the loremaster adds them to his 
network of informants. Erhine periodically contacts them via <i>sending</i>
 spells to learn what they're up to. In return, Erhine provides the PCs 
with information from time to time. He is well informed about what's 
happing in the world and in the surrounding planes. He also has 
extensive historical knowledge. Whenever doubt or lack of knowledge 
impedes the PCs, Erhine might help.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Should
 the PCs attack or kill Erhine, they'll find that a remarkable wide 
array of beings -- of all types and alignments -- miss the old coot and 
are willing to visit a little retribution on the party. Arietisa and 
Procyonai's father, Hamalik, is chief among the beings looking to punish
 the PCs.</span></p>

 always possible that some of the darker rumors about Erhine are true. 
Perhaps he's only playing the role of the eccentric scholar. In such a 
case, Erhine probably has more spells that prove useful in combat, and 
he may also have one or two bodyguards. He might have a stone golem or a
 couple of vrocks to provide some muscle.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Also, Erhine and his two "students" could be a covey of hags.</span></p>
