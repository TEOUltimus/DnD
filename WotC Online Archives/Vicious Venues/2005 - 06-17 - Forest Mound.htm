<p align="left">The mound stands tall and grassy in a sylvan clearing. 
Bright green turf studded with wildflowers covers the mound's smooth 
flanks. The whole affair seems geometrically perfect, and not a single 
tree grows on the mound. What keeps the trees off and grass trimmed?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">A mixed group of fey built this particular mound in 
ancient times. The mound is conical, with a flat top about 10 yards 
across and a base ten times as wide. Luxuriant grass and wildflowers 
cover the slopes and top. The mound hides the entrance to a deep cleft 
in the earth, where the fey have built a hamlet. A secret door in the 
mound's side allows entrance into the cleft. A guardian keeps watch over
 the entrance and attempts to distract or defeat any nonresidents who 
might try to enter.</p>
<p align="left">The mound lies within a day's walk of several forest 
communities where humans and other humanoids dwell. Most of these people
 know about the mound and its eclectic mix of fey residents. One of the 
guardians, a spriggan called Thistle, is something of a metalsmith. 
Thistle oils and sharpens, or repairs, metal tools that nonresidents 
leave on a certain flat rock near the base of the mound. This simple 
arrangement helps to maintain goodwill between the fey and their mortal 
neighbors. Beyond that, the forest residents have little interaction 
with the folk of the mound. On clear summer nights, the mound dwellers 
emerge to dance atop the mound. The neighboring humanoids steer clear of
 the mound on such nights because they know the fey don't care for 
guests when they dance under the open sky.</p>

<p align="left"><b>About the Guardians</b></p>
<p align="left">The mound's guardians prove as strange as the mound and 
the community it conceals. Thistle, an unusual spriggan, and Gingersnap,
 a faerie dragon, share the duty.</p>
<p align="left">Thistletheed (Thistle for short) is an orphan raised by 
two well-meaning half-elves. Thistle doesn't know the exact 
circumstances of his birth; all he knows for sure is that his adoptive 
parents found him as a toddler one autumn morning, trying to make a 
breakfast of thistle seeds. (Thistle remains fond of thistle seeds to 
this day, and his habit of eating them gave rise to his nickname.) City 
born and bred, the half-elves had decided to retire to the forest after a
 lifetime split between adventuring and working as merchants. They had 
little knowledge of the perils lurking in the woods, and they took in 
the waif without a second thought.</p>
<p align="left">Thistle's adoptive parents believed their new charge had
 strayed from a gnome settlement nearby, or perhaps was a survivor from 
an attack on a gnome village or caravan. They named their foundling 
Fonkin, since that was the only male gnome name they could think of at 
the time, and set out to find his parents. They searched for more than a
 year before giving up. They visited many gnome families, but none were 
missing a little boy.</p>
<p align="left">Fonkin proved to be a handful. He was a short-tempered 
and contrary child who loved smashing things. He also had a penchant for
 cruelty to other living things, but his adoptive parents cured him of 
that with firm but loving discipline. Fonkin's adoptive parents taught 
him to speak Common and Sylvan. They tried to teach him Gnome, but for 
some reason the boy didn't seem to take well to that language.</p>
<p align="left">As Fonkin approached maturity, his spell-like abilities 
and power to change size came to the fore. For a time, his adoptive 
parents believed that Fonkin might be a budding sorcerer. A visit to an 
elf sage, however, confirmed his fey nature and true heritage. The sage 
guessed that Fonkin's natural parents probably were members of a 
spriggan raiding party. They most likely hid the child in a safe place 
before staging a raid in which they were killed. A very confused Fonkin 
bid his adoptive parents farewell and set off to find his place in the 
world.</p>
<p align="left">The adolescent Fonkin might have come to grief if he 
hadn't met a new friend -- Gingersnap the faerie dragon. Gingersnap 
found young Fonkin one late summer morning munching on his favorite 
snack -- thistle seeds. The dragon's curiosity was aroused, and 
Gingersnap asked the strange youngster what he was eating. Since 
Fonkin's mouth was full, he couldn't speak very clearly. 
"Thistletheeds," he replied. Gingersnap thought Fonkin's response was 
uproariously funny, and she laughed hard. Gingersnap has an infectious 
laugh, and soon the pair were chortling and giggling together. After the
 fit of merriment had passed, Gingersnap led Fonkin, now nicknamed 
"Thistletheed," to the faerie mound. Gingersnap had been a member of the
 community within the mound for some time, and Fonkin quickly settled 
into the job of chief watchman for the group. </p>
<p align="left">Few members of the mound community can match Fonkin's 
combat prowess, particularly when he's enlarged. Over the years, Fonkin 
has learned a few useful skills, including tumbling and metalworking. 
When not guarding the mound's entrance, Fonkin crafts useful metal items
 for his fellow mound folk. He also sharpens or repairs metal implements
 that other forest dwellers leave for him. The nickname Thistletheed has
 stuck to Fonkin, though most mound dwellers -- Fonkin and Gingersnap 
included -- shorten it to Thistle.</p>

<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The mound is located in a particularly rugged portion of
 the forest. The land is rugged, strewn with massive boulders, and 
covered with dense thickets of massive trees. The <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">PCs</a>
 aren't likely to stumble upon the mound unless they go hunting for game
 or have some other reason to search the countryside. Any of the 
following might do the trick:</p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs pick up a rumor (or hear a bard's tale) of a magic rock 
located deep in the forest. Any well-used edged weapon or sharp 
implement can pick up a magical enhancement if left exposed to new moon 
on the rock.<br><br></li>
<li> This story is loosely based on Thistle's habit of sharpening 
weapons and tools for his neighbors. The tale has exaggerated the facts.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs are encamped in the forest when they receive a visit from 
Gingersnap. The faerie dragon uses her spell-like abilities to play some
 sort of prank on the group. One of her favorite tricks is to use <i>dancing lights</i> and <i>ghost sound</i>
 to create the illusion of a group of gruff-voiced humanoids or giants 
singing around a campfire. If anyone goes to investigate, Gingersnap 
takes the opportunity to lead the party's mounts off into the woods or 
swipe something from the party. To recover the missing items, the PCs 
face a protected negotiation with some unlikely creature, such as a 
massive green giant or a talking porcupine (most likely a <i>major image</i>
 with Gingersnap providing the voice). Gingersnap most likely leaves the
 filched item or animals in Thistle's care until she's finished with her
 gag.<br><br> In such an assumed form, Gingersnap might address the party as follows.<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#999999" width="540"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="left">"Oh ho! Lost something, have you? Careless of you, I 
must say. Creatures like yourselves are always mooning about the woods 
and then complaining that they lost something. How would you like it if 
the fairies camped in your home and barbecued your pet for dinner and 
left trash all over the place and then accused you of stealing from 
them? Hmm? But you think everything's about you, don't you? You probably
 just misplaced whatever you're looking for. You have no attention spans
 at all. It's probably a result of eating meat. You know, creatures like
 you aren't cut out for eating meat. Dulls your senses. You don't even 
have teeth like predators, let alone the noses to track prey. You just 
like to pretend you're at the top of the food chain for the status. 
Maybe if you ate more vegetables, you'd be able to sharpen up your 
senses and hone your awareness a little. Carrots -- those are great for 
the eyes. And spinach builds you up. You won't be losing things if you 
eat those! How about if I help you find some nice vegetables, and then 
maybe you can find what you've lost? </p>
<p align="left">"No? Well, what is it you think I can do for you? You 
think I can just drop everything I'm doing to help careless twits clomp 
around the woods and search for things? I have a job here, you know. 
Who's going to harvest the mustard blossoms and knit sweaters for the 
fairies out of spidersilk if I'm always out doing favors for other 
people? Who's going to tune their violins? Entertainment's a very 
important part of life, you know. I don't suppose you can do anything 
amusing, can you?"</p>

<li>Communities near the mound have suffered a rash of petty but 
troublesome pranks and thefts. Wagon wheels have been rigged to fall 
off, foodstuffs have been spilled or spoiled, and unwary folk have been 
attacked in the night and nearly bludgeoned to death. Now several 
children have been abducted, and the villagers' patience has come to an 
end. The folk of the mound seem the most likely suspects, and the elders
 from several communities have banded together to hire someone to 
deliver an ultimatum to the folk of the mound: Desist or move on. The 
villagers also want the abductees returned (and no changelings, please).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In fact, a group of jermlaine has moved into the area, 
and those evil creatures are behind the trouble. The jermlaine have 
taken care never to be seen. Their goals simply may be to cause trouble,
 or perhaps they seek to have the mound folk driven off so they can take
 over the settlement. In any case, it falls to the PCs to uncover the 
truth and deal with the menace.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Mound (EL 6-9)</b></p>
<p align="left">No trail leads directly to the mound, but several

can direct the group to mound.</p>

<p align="left"> The forest all around has an untamed look about it. 
Massive boles of ancient trees rise from the rugged ground and tilt in 
all directions, like the pillars of a great hall rocked by an 
earthquake. Is seems as though only the branches interlocking overhead 
keep the great trees from falling over. Here and there, a forest giant 
has collapsed, leaving behind a sunny spot where a tangle of thorny 
vines grows. Under the standing trees a damp, verdant gloom prevails.</p>
<p align="left">Larger clearings where the ground seems too rocky for 
trees to grow provide some warmth and relief from the shadow. One of 
these clearings sports a fringe of jumbled rocks, moss-covered and 
garlanded with ferns where branches overhang the rocks. A smooth-sided 
mound covered with grasses and wildflowers rises from the rocks. The 
slope looks as steep and regular as a rampart leading up to a castle 
wall. All is quiet, except for the rhythmic scraping of stone on metal. 
It's hard to tell where the sound is coming from, but it seems to arise 
from the trees near the base of the slope.</p>

<p align="left">The <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_character')">characters</a>
 can track down the sound eventually. It comes from a natural bowl not 
far from the base of the mound. The mound is rocky and moss covered, 
with a few trees struggling up through the rocks and a profusion of 
ferns growing everywhere. One flat rock holds two small piles of axes, 
knives, scissors, and other assorted metal implements. The items in one 
pile look shiny and new. The other pile has items that look well used, 
if not broken.</p>
<p align="left">This area serves as the guardpost and greeting area for 
the mound. The actual entrance is a secret door in the mound's side, 
about halfway up the slope. To open the door, one must knock three times
 at the base of a particular climbing rose vine. The vine is about as 
thick as a halfling's forearm, but covered with thorns, which makes 
knocking on it a delicate operation if one tries it with bare knuckles 
(the residents usually use a stick). The secret door has two thick stone
 panels covered with living turf and wildflowers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Secret Door:</b> 9 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 135; break DC 26, Search DC 25.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures:</b> Either Thistle or Gingersnap (see 
above for statistics) is here at any hour of the day or night, keeping 
watch for visitors. There is a more or less equal chance that either 
will be present at any given time; both guards could be present, as 
well. The rasping sound the PCs heard when they arrived at the mound 
could be Thistle sharpening a tool, or it could be one of Gingersnap's<i> ghost sound </i>effects.</p>
<p align="left">If Thistle is present, he may be singing to himself as 
he works. He tends to sing snatches of a lullaby that his spriggan 
parents sang when he was an infant. Thus, as they approach, the PCs may 
hear a song something like this one.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="95%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="left">Never leave the bones behind! They're good for making bread.</p>
<p align="left">Dry them out and grind them fine, then bake them, Mama said. </p>
<p align="left">Never leave the eyes behind! They make the greatest snacks.</p>
<p align="left">Just yank them out and dip in blood, then take a few more whacks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Though he isn't a bloodthirsty creature, his parents were, and the song sticks in his mind. </p>
<p align="left">The mound folk also keep two fairly tame wolves or dire 
wolves nearby to discourage intruders. These animals are trained to 
assist the guards. They might be on hand to help defend the mound, or 
they might be off frolicking or hunting in the forest. Feel free to 
choose whichever combination of guardians will make the best encounter 
for your campaign. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wolves (2): </b>hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 283.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dire Wolves (2): </b>hp 45 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 65.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>Both Thistle and Gingersnap prefer to 
keep their distance in a fight, especially if they are on guard alone. 
Thistle prefers to stay hidden behind the ferns and question visitors 
about their business. In a fight, Thistle plays the sniper, popping out 
of hiding to use his <i>produce flame</i> ability, then hiding again. 
Occasionally, he hides and changes position to keep foes guessing about 
where he his. He prefers to direct his <i>produce flame </i>attacks 
against armored characters. If he defeats the armor wearers, he assumes 
Large size and uses his short sword against the survivors. If the foes 
close with him, Thistle likely uses his <i>oil of darkness</i> or a 
smoke stick to give him enough concealment to hide and temporarily break
 off the fight, but he soon returns to resume sniping from another 
location.</p>
<p align="left">If he has wolves or dire wolves to help him, Thistle is a
 bit bolder. He sends in the wolves to attack, and possibly trip, the 
enemy's fighter types and he uses his Tumble skill to get into position 
for a few sneak attacks.</p>
<p align="left">When fighting on her own, Gingersnap prefers to use her 
Flyby Attack feat and then use her breath weapon on as many foes as 
possible. She then uses <i>glitterdust</i> or <i>entangle</i> on anyone who isn't dazed. After that, she usually tries <i>charm monster</i> on the most dangerous-looking foe. If she thinks she needs help, she uses <i>summon nature's ally </i>or <i>animate objects</i> (there are plenty of rocks to animate). If Thistle and Gingersnap are on guard together, the faerie dragon uses <i>summon nature's ally </i>or <i>animate objects </i>immediately, so as to give Thistle chances to make sneak attacks, then she uses <i>charm monster</i> or her breath weapon against foes that prove dangerous to Thistle.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Settlement</b></p>
<p align="left">If the PCs open the secret door, they find a passage 
sloping down to a chasmlike cavern with naturally terraced walls. A 
subterranean brook runs through the center and feeds a crystalline pool.
 The rocky slopes are thick with a variety of brightly colored fungi, 
some the size of mushrooms found at the dinner table and others the size
 of oak trees. Many of the fungi are luminescent, and hundreds of <i>continual flame </i>spells provide additional light.</p>
<p align="left">Gaily painted cottages, huts, and rambling palaces rise 
amid the fungi, and twisting streets connect them all. A sandy area 
around the pool serves as a marketplace and open-air dance hall. Many of
 the luminescent fungi shine only 12 hours a day, and this provides a 
noticeable cycle of light and dark in the hamlet. Each evening at 
twilight, the residents gather near the pool to sing and dance for 
hours.</p>
<p align="left">The residents aren't terribly fond of visitors, 
especially if Thistle or Gingersnap will not (or cannot) vouch for them,
 but strangers who keep the peace are welcome to shop in the marketplace
 and even sing and dance a little, so long as they do not stay beyond 
the next sunrise in the outer world. Most of the items for sale in the 
market are made for creatures of size Small or smaller, but there's a 
smattering of goods suitable for Medium creatures. The joke-loving fey 
aren't above trying to pick visitors' pockets or selling illusory goods.
 A complaint to mayor Venlathii, a feytouched druid (see <i>Fiend Folio, </i>page 71) will secure either a refund or the genuine goods.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dealing with the Jermlaine (EL 6-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">If the PCs visit the mound to investigate the 
jermlaine's nefarious activities, the PCs quickly learn that the mound 
folk not only have nothing to do with the attacks on the neighboring 
villages, but that they too have been harassed. The jermlaine have 
established a lair in the cellar below a ruined building located in or 
near one of the woodland villages in the mound's vicinity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures:</b> A fairly large raiding party of 
jermlaine has moved in. During daylight hours, all the jermlaine are in 
the lair. At night, about half the jermlaine are out doing mischief. The
 kidnapped children are here, too. The jermlaine have them busy 
enlarging their lair. To add some challenge to the jermlaine encounter, 
consider adding a wererat or two.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Jermlaine (8-16):</b> hp 1 each; see <i>Monster Manual II </i>page 131.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rats (0 or 4-16):</b> hp 1 each; see <i>Monster Manual </i>page 278.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dire Rats (0 or 2-8):</b> hp 5 each; see <i>Monster Manual </i>page 64.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wererats (0-2):</b> hp 12 each; see <i>Monster Manual </i>page 173.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The jermlaine prefer to fight from the 
cellar's walls and ceiling, which are riddled with tiny runs that allow 
then to scurry around unseen. They have several nets hidden in the 
ceiling beams. The jermlaine drop the nets on anyone unlucky enough to 
step under them. The rats, dire rats, and wererats do their best to 
surround and bite foes. When not dropping nets, the jermlaine keep up a 
steady fire of darts.</p>
