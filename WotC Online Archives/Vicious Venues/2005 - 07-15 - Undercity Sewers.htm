<p align="left">Local tales speak of many strange and dangerous things 
lurking below the gratings and drainpipes that lead to the sewers below 
the city streets. How many of these lurid stories are true? Or perhaps 
the tales don't go quite far enough.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">Generations ago, a fire swept through a city, prompting 
the city elders to undertake a massive reconstruction. They laid out new
 streets and created a network of aqueducts and wastewater tunnels 
beneath them. These new excavations lay alongside older catacombs and 
sub-basements. Over the years, property owners have built connections 
between many of the chambers and tunnels, creating a veritable labyrinth
 under the city.</p>
<p align="left">The system still serves to carry clean water into the 
city and drain waste out, but a complex of freight tunnels also serves 
legitimate businesses, plus a larger network of delvings keeps certain 
less savory activities out of sight.</p>
<p align="left"><b>About Hertig and Rutjur</b></p>
<p align="left">Thanks to his mongrelfolk heritage, Hertig has a bizarre
 appearance, with jug ears, protruding teeth, sparse hair, and clawlike 
hands and feet. Most mongrelfolk are timid if not downright cowardly. 
Hertig, however, showed a stalwart character from an early age by 
standing up to bullies of all sorts and generally protecting the weak. 
He also showed a talent for healing. But his tribal leaders considered 
Hertig's chivalrous heart a threat to the group. They wanted no heroes.</p>
<p align="left">Hertig turned to an adventuring life but had trouble 
joining an effective group. Eventually, a cleric of Heironeous (or some 
other appropriate deity from your campaign) recognized Hertig's 
potential and arranged to have him educated. Hertig proved an apt pupil 
and quickly became a paladin (a vocation that fits his soul even if it 
belies his appearance). Hertig's superiors were at a loss when deciding 
what to do with him. He had winning ways, but he was hardly suitable for
 any public role in the religious hierarchy -- at least not in human 
lands. Ultimately, Hertig was assigned to guard the city sewers. His 
immunity to disease (courtesy of his paladin training) and dedication to
 serving the greater good made him ideal for the job.</p>
<p align="left">Hertig's job requires him to monitor the sewers for 
intruders or damage and relay his findings to the surface authorities. 
He's also charged with protecting repair workers, rescuing anyone 
unfortunate (or foolish) enough to become lost in the sewers, and 
monitoring any illegal activities there. The recent defection of his 
assistant, Rutjur, to the Thieves' Guild (see below) undermines Hertig's
 efforts toward the latter task.</p>
<p align="left">Though most humans fail to recognize them, Hertig has 
many gifts, including unflagging cheerfulness, courage, and an 
inexplicable talent for making friends and putting people at ease.</p>
<p align="left">Statistics for Hertig at two different levels are given below.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b>Special Mount Benefits (Ex):</b> Hertig and Dragonfly enjoy the empathic link and share spells special qualities.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Empathic Link (Ex):</i> Hertig can communicate 
telepathically with Dragonfly at a distance of up to 1 mile. The master 
has the same connection to an item or a place that the mount does.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i> Hertig may have any spell (but
 not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect Dragonfly 
if the latter is within 5 feet at the time. Hertig may also cast a spell
 with a target of "You" on Dragonfly (as a touch range spell) of on 
himself. Hertig and Dragonfly may share spells even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of Dragonfly's type.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Possessions: </b><i>+1 studded leather</i>, masterwork light wooden shield, <i>ring of protection +1,</i> masterwork morningstar, 6 darts, 2 oil of <i>magic weapon, </i>potion of <i>cure moderate wounds,</i> potion of <i>eagle's splendor,</i> potion of <i>hide from animals,</i> potion of <i>shield of faith, </i>10 sp.</p>
<p align="left">Rutjur is a young human, about 19 years old, with a 
slender build, quick hands, and an insatiable curiosity. Rutjur is a 
foundling, abandoned at a temple of Hertig's faith as an infant. He 
showed a knack for getting along with animals at an early age, and he 
soon boasted that he would become a famous defender of the faith 
someday. Rutjur, however, has little patience for doing anything that 
doesn't come easily and thus far he has proven a failure as an 
apprentice cleric or paladin. In fact, he lacks the strength of will for
 either job. When Rutjur learned of Hertig and his job as guardian of 
the sewers, he practically begged to become Hertig's assistant; Rutjur 
was convinced life under the city would be one long adventure.</p>
<p align="left">Life in the sewers turned out to be smelly, 
uncomfortable, and boring for Rutjur. The young man, however, has 
befriended several of the thieves who have hideouts in the sewers. He 
keeps his friends informed of Hertig's plans and whereabouts and the 
thieves have reciprocated by teaching Rutjur some of the finer points of
 living dishonestly. Eventually, Hertig will probably figure out how the
 criminals in the sewers outwit him, but until then Rutjur enjoys the 
double life he has found for himself. Rutjur doesn't see his actions as 
any kind of betrayal of Hertig's trust, just as something that keeps him
 entertained.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rutjur:</b> Male human expert 1/rogue 1; CR 2; Medium
 humanoid (human); HD 1d6+1 plus 1d6+1; hp 9; Init +2; Spd 30 ft.; AC 
14, touch 12, flat-footed 12; Base Atk +0; Grapple +1; Atk and Full Atk

masterwork light crossbow); SA sneak attack (+1d6); SQ trapfinding; AL 
CN; SV Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +2; Str 12, Dex 15, Con 13, Int 14, Wis 10,

Device +6, Handle Animal +1, Hide +6, Listen +7, Move Silently +6, Open 
Lock +6, Perform (wind instruments) +1, Spot +3, Swim +4, Tumble +5, Use
 Magic Device +1; Alertness, Lightning Reflexes.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Languages:</i> Common.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sneak Attack (Ex):</b> Rutjur deals +1d6 extra points
 of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked 
targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus 
for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against 
targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures 
without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from
 critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Rutjur may choose to 
deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a 
weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trapfinding (Ex):</b> Rutjur can find, disarm, or 
bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to 
find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the 
level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result 
exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap
 without triggering or disarming it.</p>

<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The sewer system described here can exist under any 
large town or small city, or it might simply be part of a much larger 
complex under a bigger community. For example, it might lie under a 
business district in a large city or metropolis.</p>
<p align="left">The sewers are far from deserted. The city elders were 
all too aware that the sewers could serve as a refuge for outlaws or a 
route into the city for invaders, so they took care to stock the tunnels
 with a few guardians. Today, these guardians often come into conflict 
with the sewers' clandestine elements and create an ongoing struggle 
that the surface dwellers know very little about. Player characters who 
own buildings or who are affiliated with a thieves' guild or similar 
organization might already be familiar with sewers and their denizens. 
Others characters might require an introduction, such as one of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs witness a thunderstorm in which balls of lightning 
literally shoot up out of the sewers and dance along the street, only to
 disappear into the sewers again.<br><br> The balls of lightning might 
be natural electrical discharges or flaming bits of sewer gas. If the 
PCs choose to pursue or investigate them, treat them as <i>flaming sphere</i> effects. They move randomly up to 30 feet each round. Use the splash weapon miss diagram on page 158 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 to determine the direction they move each round, but assume they move 
directly toward any sewer entrance within 30 feet (except on the round 
after they emerge). A ball deals 2d6 points of fire or electricity 
damage, or 1d6 points of each, or perhaps no damage at all, to anything 
it strikes. <br><br> The balls also might be will-o-wisps from one of the settling basins (see below).<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs hear tales of shadow figures staring out from behind sewer 
gratings (or perhaps a PC with a fairly high Spot bonus sees such a 
figure).<br><br> The figures might be rogues from the local thieves' 
guild watching the street, or they might be Hertig or his assistant, 
Rutjur, taking a peek outside (see below).<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs hear tales of a deformed creature that lurks in the sewers. 
Some say this creature is benign, but others insist that it is a hideous
 fiend or insane wizard who is breeding an army to take over the city 
and devour its citizens.<br><br> The tales refer to Hertig, the little-known guardian of the sewers. The more macabre stories are distortions.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs are hired to enter the sewers and track down a lost or stolen item.<br><br>
 The item's owner might have simply dropped the item in question, or 
perhaps a pickpocket or burglar has stolen it. For a twist on this 
theme, perhaps Hertig already has found and returned the item and the 
owner wants to deliver a reward.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Exploring the Sewers</b></p>
<p align="left">The sewers contain many different kinds of tunnels and chambers. Here's a sampling of what visitors might find.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Entrances</b></p>
<p align="left">Characters can access the sewers several different ways.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gratings:</b> The city's major streets are equipped 
with gutters and gratings that drain off rainwater. Residents also push 
nightsoil and other trash into these gratings. Most gratings are 
permanently fixed into place, and they don't offer egress for many 
creatures bigger than size Diminutive. Others are equipped with hinges 
and padlocks that allow the grate to open for cleaning. Still others 
have been surreptitiously converted into secret doors (usually by the 
sewers' less savory denizens). All these gratings have the same basic 
statistics, as noted below.</p>
<p align="left">Each grating leads to a vertical shaft that is 10 to 25 
feet long and lined with smooth masonry (Climb DC 20). If the grating is
 designed to be opened, iron rungs are set into the shaft (Climb DC 5).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Grating:</b> 4 in. thick; hardness 10; hp 120; break 
DC 27, Open Lock DC 25 (if padlocked), Search DC 25 (to locate opening 
mechanism when the grating is a secret door).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Drainage Tunnels (EL 2-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">These structures carry storm runoff and other wastes 
away from the city. The entire network leads to a single outlet set in 
some inaccessible place (a cliff face, marsh, or river bottom), where 
the effluent is discharged. A typical drainage tunnel is about 7 feet 
high and 10 to 20 feet wide. A tunnel floor has walkways about 2-1/2 
feet wide along both walls and a trough 10 feet deep in between. The 
walkways usually prove damp and slightly slippery. Any Large or bigger 
creature must make a DC 12 Balance check to move along the walkways at 
half speed. A Small or Medium creature can move at full speed but must 
make a DC 7 Balance check to fight, charge, or run on the walkways. Tiny
 and smaller creatures can use the walkways without making Balance 
checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures:</b> PCs may meet roving denizens of the sewers while moving along the walkways.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bat Swarm:</b> hp 13; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 237.</p>
<p align="left">These creatures roost in the sewers during the day and 
crawl to the surface at night, where they fly around hunting insects. If
 disturbed, the bats flee. Some locations might include rookeries. In 
such places, the bats defend their young.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rat Swarms (1-3):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 239.</p>
<p align="left">The rats attack any living creatures they encounter.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ochre Jelly:</b> hp 69; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 202.</p>
<p align="left">These creatures usually cling to the walls. They live by
 scooping detritus from the troughs, but will attack other creatures 
when they get the chance. When at rest, they look like patches of lichen
 on the walls.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Black Pudding:</b> hp 115; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 201.</p>
<p align="left">These creatures act just like the ochre jellies, except that they resemble sooty or oily patches on the walls.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sewer Workers:</b> See the Main Settling Basin entry.</p>
<p align="left">The PCs might meet Hertig or his assistant, Rutjur, out making their rounds. See Main Settling Basin entry for details.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Thugs:</b> See the Sub-Basements entry.</p>
<p align="left">These groups of fighters, rogues, and clerics are generally hostile; see the Sub-Basements entry for details.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Creatures:</b> The residents in a nearby settling basin might be out hunting; see the Settling Basin entry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Settling Basins (EL 2-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">Large, brick-lined ponds are located throughout the 
sewers. Wastewater collects in the basins and any sediment in it settles
 out. Storms cause water to surge into the basins, forcing the clearer 
water near the surface out.</p>
<p align="left">Most settling basins are circular and about 30 feet 
wide, with a 5-foot walkway all around. From two to six drainage tunnels
 feed into each basin. Half the tunnels are sloped to drain out of the 
basin and the remainder drain in.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures: </b>Many settling basins teem with 
creatures. The city elders stocked the basins with some of these 
creatures to provide the city with some security. Other creatures have 
simply moved in and settled down.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Crocodiles (1-3):</b> hp 22 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 271.</p>
<p align="left">These creatures usually float near the walkways, waiting to ambush anything that comes too close.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shocker Lizards (3-5):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 224.</p>
<p align="left">The lizards usually spread out in the chamber, with some
 in the water and some clinging to the walls, but always within 20 feet 
of each other. The lizards are fairly nervous, but not overly 
aggressive. One lizard usually hisses a warning before the whole group 
looses a lethal shock.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Juvenile Tojanida (1-2):</b> hp 19 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 244.</p>
<p align="left">These creatures usually aren't aggressive toward other 
intelligent creatures. They're willing to share whatever information 
they have about the sewers or the city above in exchange for a few 
morsels of food. The tojanidas know Hertig and Rutjur and they like the 
pair (see the Main Settling Basin entry). They've also met many other 
intelligent residents of the sewers, and they're less fond of them (see 
the Sub-Basements entry).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Otyugh:</b> hp 36; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 204.</p>
<p align="left">An otyugh usually finds a mound of sediment and stands 
on it. Most of the time, it stays submerged and uses its eyestalk like a
 periscope. It kicks its way to the surface now and then for a breath. 
The creature generally tries to wait until a group exits the chamber, 
then attacks the last person to leave.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Adult Tojanida:</b> hp 45; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 243.</p>
<p align="left">These creatures usually act much like their juvenile<b></b>brethren, but tend to be more lucid.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sub-Basements (EL 5-10)</b></p>
<p align="left">These chambers usually are located under abandoned 
buildings. Some, however, lie under newer buildings whose occupants are 
unaware (or claim to be unaware) of their existence. Some sub-basements 
are single chambers (perhaps 20 to 40 feet square); others are complexes
 of several chambers. A few sub-basements have plain, stone doors that 
open onto a drainage tunnel or settling basin. Most of them, however, 
have secret doors. Most sub-basements are built above the level of the 
surrounding sewers, and short flights of steps lead up from the doors 
into the basement.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stone Doors or Stone Secret Doors:</b> 4 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 60; break DC 23 (28 if locked), Open Lock DC 25, Search DC 25 (for secret doors).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures:</b> Sub-basements are havens for thieves, 
smugglers, evil clerics, and one black dragon. Most of the people change
 their lodgings from time to time, moving from one sub-basement to 
another. An occupied sub-basement often contains one or two thieves or 
clerics of levels 2-4 with one or two fighters of levels 1-3 for each 
thief or cleric. Use the NPC statistics in Chapter 4 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<p align="left">These characters live unsavory lives and tend to attack 
visitors unless bribed or expertly persuaded to be peaceful. Most of 
these characters despise Hertig as a meddling do-gooder. They're 
reluctant to kill him, however, because they fear retribution from the 
city government. A few of the thieves have befriended Rutjur, Hertig's 
restless assistant. They have taught the youngster an array of thieving 
skills and have gained his trust. They use that trust to get information
 about Hertig's plans and movements.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Young Adult Black Dragon:</b> hp 157; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 72.</p>
<p align="left">The dragon, Ehilunthurix, is a fairly new arrival to the
 sewers. Hertig suspects the dragon's presence, but has not located its 
lair, nor does he know how big it is. Ehilunthurix thinks herself 
invincible and gladly spares the PCs' lives in exchange for a magic item
 or a few hundred gold pieces worth of gems. Ironically, Ehilunthurix is
 helping Hertig with his job. The dragon has been harassing the criminal
 element in the sewers in an attempt to take control.</p>
<p align="left">Ehilunthurix makes her lair in a partially flooded complex of three chambers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Main Settling Basin (EL 4-5)</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, the network of settling basins and 
drainage tunnels in the sewers leads to a big settling basin 70 feet in 
diameter surrounded by a walkway 10 feet wide.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures: </b>Hertig and Rutjur dwell here in a 
series of sub-basements that adjoin the main chamber (see the About 
Hertig and Rutjur section for statistics). Each has a fairly snug and 
dry bedchamber with a narrow bed, table, chair, and chest for spare 
clothes and sundry items. At least one of the pair is home at any given 
time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Hertig would rather negotiate than 
fight. If he has advance warning of an encounter, Hertig prefers to hide
 and observe the newcomers for awhile. If the strangers don't seem 
dangerous, he plays the role of a beggar or confused workman, all the 
while attempting to get the strangers to reveal who they are and what 
they want. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="left">Somewhere ahead, a surprisingly melodious voice sings a nonsense song.</p>
<p align="left">"Treasures once shiny and clothes once fine,<br> Plaything old and new,<br> All find their way to this home of mine,<br> Once discarded by you."</p>
<p align="left">Moments later, a disgusting creature that may once have 
been human steps out from around a corner carrying a toolbox. Its teeth 
protrude from its lips, and its nearly bald pate is surrounded by long 
wisps of straggly blond hair. It awkwardly smoothes its garb -- a motley
 collection of tattered, mismatched clothing -- with a clawlike hand and
 bobs a quick bow of deference. "Ah, good day, gentles," it says in the 
same melodious voice. "Are you lost? It is no shame to be lost. Many who
 come down here cannot find their way because they are used to the 
bright light above. But I know the ways below. I can show you the way 
out if you wish."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the PCs ask Hertig about his business, he claims to be a workman assigned to fix broken tiles in the walkways. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="left">"I come to fix a spot I saw yesterday. Ah, here it is. 
Must keep tunnels safe." The fellow sets down his toolbox and runs one 
clawlike hand over a broken spot in the tiles lining the drainage tunnel
 before bending down to extract a tool from his box. "Have you seen 
other spots where tiles are cracked?" he asks as he begins prying at a 
broken tile.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the PCs claim they have come in search of treasure, 
Hertig laughs and tells them that he has found plenty of treasure here. 
He then extracts a broken piece of glass and shows it to them. "Lots 
more like this down here," he says. If the PCs tell him they are in 
search of a particular sewer-dwelling creature, he warns them of the 
dangers of the creatures below. "Beware the dragon!" he says. If the PCs
 have already seen the crocodiles, they may laugh off this warning.</p>
<p align="left">If the characters tell Hertig they have come in search 
of a thieves' conclave, he insists that such things are not for nice 
people and tells them to leave. Rutjur, however, may try to signal a PC 
in the rear of the party to follow him to the nearest thieves' den.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs go off to slay sewer monsters, Hertig follows
 along behind to make sure they aren't in over their heads. Should the 
battle prove too difficult for them, he joins in the fight.</p>
<p align="left">Should a fight break out with the PCs, Hertig tries to 
defeat the enemy leader with his morningstar. He'll call Dragonfly (if 
available) and have the warhorse attack the enemy flank (Hertig is no 
rider). If necessary, Hertig will withdraw from battle just long enough 
to get out of sight so that he can hide again. He then waits to renew 
the attack for a more opportune time.</p>
<p align="left">Rutjur is headstrong and spoiling for a fight, but he's 
not quite brave enough to meet a foe head-on. Like Hertig, Rutjur 
prefers to hide when trouble approaches. Unlike Hertig, Rutjur also 
likes to sneak attack unsuspecting foes.</p>
<p align="left">When the two face trouble together, Rutjur usually stays
 in hiding while Hertig speaks. If violence erupts, Rutjur sneak attacks
 the nearest foe, then tries to team up with Hertig to flank someone.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Treasure:</b> Hertig keeps various trinkets and 
oddments that he has gleaned from the sewers heaped in a chamber near 
his own. Bits of cracked pottery, tattered clothing, broken toys, and 
bent tableware cram the dank cell. Hertig claims that everything he owns
 that is worth anything lies in the chamber. In fact, the collection 
includes one gem -- a piece of garnet worth 10 gp. Hertig knows just 
where the gem is, but an intruder would have to make an effort to find 
it (DC 25 Search check). </p>
