<p align="LEFT"> A rippling pond rimmed with reeds and lily pads 
supports a vocal population of frogs. The occasional splash from a 
jumping fish hints at life hidden below the surface. What else lies 
under the water? Local tales say this is a magical place, and while the 
pond is truly beautiful, perhaps this spot has magic of an eldritch sort
 as well?</p>

 the pond looks somewhat ordinary, it holds a few secrets. It has a 
shallow basin filled with fairly clear spring water. A sinkhole in the 
basin, however, plunges more than 100 feet to a flooded cavern below. 
Seepage from the ocean nearby keeps the cavern filled with saltwater. 
Though the pond and the cavern are connected, very little water flows 
between them because the lighter freshwater literally floats over the 
saltwater below. The water in the pond rises and falls with the tides, 
but only very slightly and the change is so gradual that it's barely 
noticeable even when a visitor watches for it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The pond above is filled with reeds, lily pads, frogs, 
and a few freshwater fish. The salty depths are mostly lifeless, except 
for a few sponges and crustaceans.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An old bronze dragon, Lepsektogvernox, uses a dry 
section in the caverns as an occasional lair. He also keeps a portion of
 his considerable hoard hidden in the depths of the cave. 
Lepsektogvernox has encouraged a few savage creatures to take up 
residence in the pond to help guard it. He also has a penchant for 
transforming beings that annoy him into frogs, which contributes to the 
pond's amphibian population. A younger dragon, Halentiganox 
(Lepsektogvernox's daughter), also visits occasionally.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The pond lies in a hilly coastal area about 20 miles 
from the coastline or from a deep bay or estuary. Lepsektogvernox 
selected the pond as a lair because it's fairly remote; nevertheless, 
the pond is fairly well known locally as a place to avoid, thanks to its
 monstrous residents. Still, a few locals visit the place now and then 
to fish or drag the depths for sponges (none are brave or foolish enough
 to enter the water). Thanks to the dragons, there's no shortage of 
local legends that might tempt player characters to visit:</p>
<ul>
<li> A faerie sorcerer (or sorceress) who dwells in the pond can work wonders -- for people who can pay the price.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This tale refers to Lepsektogvernox and Halentiganox, 
who can be induced to perform minor services (usually spellcasting) for 
poor folk who don't have anywhere else to turn. Both dragons favor 
barter to cash payments and often require somewhat bizarre favors in 
return for their services, such as a whole basket of blooms from the 
first wildflowers of spring or a firstborn from a litter of puppies born
 under the new moon. The dragons do this mostly to make sure their 
clients work for the services they get.</p>
<ul>
<li> Ages ago, an evil cult draped its victims in gold and sacrificed 
them by throwing them into the pool, which is much deeper than it looks.
 The spirits of the lost still can be heard on dark nights. Brave souls 
who drag the pool's depths can reap great rewards -- if they can survive
 the wrath of the ancient god. Entering the water brings inescapable 
death.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This tale has some basis in fact. Locals who drag the 
pool looking for sponges sometimes bring up bits of treasure. (These 
items usually are from people who fought the pool's residents and lost.)
 The "voices of the spirits" in the tale actually refer to the pool's 
speaking residents.</p>
<ul>
<li> An enchanted prince lives in the pool. A simple kiss from a pure 
soul will break the spell and bring great wealth and good fortune -- and
 perhaps an advantageous marriage to the person who bestows the kiss.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This tale also has some basis in fact. Lepsektogvernox 
habitually turns folks who annoy him into frogs, which he leaves to stew
 for awhile in the pond. At least once in the past, the dragon has 
released a victim who has elicited a kiss from a passerby. Unfortunately
 for the PCs, the pond's current polymorphed residents are no princes.</p>
<ul>
<li> Anyone who casts something rare and valuable into the pool at a 
certain hour can expect some sort of favor in the coming month. 
Unfortunately, tales vary as to what that certain hour is.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This one arose from Lepsektogvernox and Halentiganox and
 their habit of doing favors for the locals. Someone who is truly needy 
might indeed gain a favor in exchange for a gift.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Pond (EL 3-19)</b></p>

Even in a temperate area, the pond can have open water and a lively 
population of frogs, thanks to the fairly warm seawater in the caves

 Lagade, a sleazy pickpocket, recently made the mistake of trying to 
romance Halentiganox while she was masquerading as a humanoid. When 
Halentiganox told daddy, Lepsektogvernox turned the cad into a frog 
(with his <i>baleful polymorph</i> spell) and set him in the pond. 
Lepsektogvernox was well aware that Lyman might fall prey to some of the
 carnivores in the vicinity, but reasoned that the risk was no worse 
than what Lyman faces day to day as an adventurer. In the meantime, 
Lyman will have to live by his wits and without lying or stealing.</p>
<p align="LEFT">PCs encountering Lyman must be extraordinarily patient to communicate with him, since he cannot actually speak. </p>

croaks twice, and then begins to scrape its forefoot through the mud on 
the bank, forming short furrows. These troughs bisect and interconnect 
to form crude letters in the Common tongue. Gradually, a message takes 
shape: "I am a prince held captive in this base form. If you free me, 
you will be handsomely rewarded."</p>

 options in combat beyond a hasty retreat into the depths of the pond or
 into the reeds. If approached nonviolently, Lyman does his best to 
convince the party to change him back to a human. He can't speak, but he
 can write by pawing the pond's muddy shore to form crude letters.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If freed from his frog form, Lyman tries to convince the
 PCs to dive into the depths of the pool to retrieve Lepsektogvernox's

nor does he have any real idea what lurks in the pool's depths -- as a

 own spell), he assumes his normal form and thanks them profusely.</p>

necessary. "My friends, the reward I promised you lies in the depths of 
this pond. The entire contents of the treasure caravan I was bringing to
 court my lovely lady were thrown into the pond with me. Gold, precious 
gems, fine jewelry -- all there, where it would do me no good. You have

<p align="LEFT">Unknown to Lyman (if he is present at all), a gang of 
merrow made its way inland by swimming up a nearby river. After a 
disastrous battle, the surviving merrow made their way to the pond, 
where they intend to lie low until some dark, wet night when they can 
make their way back to the sea.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Merrow (1-4):</b> hp 29 each (<i>MM</i> 199).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>The merrow stick to the deep section of 
the pool, where they keep a wary distance from the guardians there (see 
below). They usually stay hidden during the day and emerge at night to 
hunt near the pond. Day or night, however, they attack anyone who spends
 too much time near the pond (such as groups trying to negotiate with 
Lyman).</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Halentiganox (Female Juvenile Bronze Dragon):</b> hp 142 (<i>MM</i> 82).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>Halentiganox loves to turn herself into a
 frog and just hang around the pond, observing the world around her (a 
trick she learned from dad). If anyone picks her up and gives her a 
kiss, she's likely to assume a humanoid form and offer to tag along with
 her "rescuer" for a short time. She's not much interested in romance 
with nondragons, but she's curious enough about humanoid ways to 
accompany a party for a few adventures -- just long enough to acquire 
some treasure and collect a few tidbits of information.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If attacked, Halentiganox heads into the pond, assumes 
her true form, and returns to give her tormentors a taste of her 
lightning breath. While recovering her breath, she casts <i>shield,</i> 
then moves into melee reach until she can breathe again. She fights 
until reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, then plunges back into the 
pond, where she can get aid from the lair's tojanida guardians. If 
pursued and attacked in the cavern, she fights to the death.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>The tojanida stick to the depths of the 
pool, where they guard the cavern entrance. They generally don't attack 
unless molested or when someone other than Lepsektogvernox or 
Halentiganox tries to enter the cave. In a battle, the tojanida try to 
blind characters with their ink, then move past the front line to 
grapple spellcasters. If they can't bypass the opposition's front rank, 
they use their ink and try to grab characters attacking them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> The tojanida have defeated enough 
creatures to allow a fair amount of treasure to accumulate at the 
cavern's entrance. Lepsektogvernox collects the choicest bits of 
treasure for himself but allows the rest to lie there. Lepsektogvernox 
hopes this minor hoard will satisfy most treasure hunters. The amount of
 treasure varies with the size of the tojanida: Juveniles have a level 5
 treasure, adults have a level 7 treasure, and elders have a level 11 
treasure. All of the treasures are coins only.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> As a younger dragon, Lepsektogvernox 
often posed as a prince in order to romance humanoid females. He's 
through sowing his wild oats however. These days, he's content to assume
 frog form and test people's reactions. Like his daughter, he assumes a 
humanoid form if kissed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2006%20-%2002-22%20-%20Frog%20Pond_files/dx0222vv_viciousvenues_hoard.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="135" width="240"></b>If attacked, Lepsektogvernox retreats, assumes dragon form and casts <i>displacement</i> on himself. He then returns and uses his repulsion breath to drive foes away. After that, he uses <i>baleful polymorph</i>
 to turn foes who have resisted his breath into frogs. If that doesn't 
prove sufficient to defeat or drive off his foes, he uses <i>fog cloud</i> to confuse the issue and tries to pick off the opposition one character at a time, using crush attacks, melee attacks, or <i>suggestion</i>
 spells. He loves to suggest that foes take a swim to the depths of the 
pond and count to a thousand. Characters who succumb have to deal with 
the pond's resident tojanida.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Development:</b> Read or paraphrase the following if a PC kisses Lepsektogvernox.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The body of the great bullfrog shimmers and deforms, 
seeming to turn inward on itself. Then suddenly, it vanishes, and in its
 place stands a handsome, gray-haired man with a crown of gold upon his 
head. "Ah, it does an old man's heart good to be kissed by such a comely
 young person," he says, his eyes crinkling with merriment. "And you 
must have a good heart indeed to seek out an old king and free him from 
this vile enchantment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"But I am almost sad now to leave my amphibious form. 
The world has gone on without me, you see. My kingdom has long since 
passed to another, and my children have grown up and forgotten me. 
Perhaps I shall build myself a hut on the banks of the pond and live out
 the rest of my days here. This place has become home to me, you see. 
And I fear I have little to offer my rescuer other than a life here on 
the banks of this pond."</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Treasure:</b> Lepsektogvernox has collected a 
considerable hoard, as shown above. He keeps about a quarter of the 
gems, art objects, and coins hidden in the caverns below the pond. The 
loot, however, lies hidden under the silt and sand on the cave floor. 
The caverns stretch for nearly five miles, and it would take weeks of 
searching to locate the treasure, plus several days to recover it all.</p>
