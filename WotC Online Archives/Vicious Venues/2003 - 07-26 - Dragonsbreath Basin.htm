<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An
 eroded statue rises from a seething pool of superheated water. Is the 
statue and its basin merely an ancient steambath? Or does the place 
harbor some powerful force -- and is that force living or dead?</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Background for the DM</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 clan of azers built the dragonsbreath basin many centuries ago over the
 site of a natural geyser. The heat-loving azers had established a 
mining colony on the Material Plane, and they lost no time in converting
 the geyser into a vast, communal steambath where they could take their 
ease in conditions that at least partially resembled the conditions on 
their home plane. Over time, however, the geyser's waters became more 
and more acid, forcing the azers to abandon the bath. A raid by a group 
of efreet finally convinced the azers to abandon the colony as well. 
Since that time, the basin chamber has seen some use by various 
fire-loving creatures over the years. Most recently the occupants 
include an efreeti and her jann allies.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 dragonsbreath basin gets its name from the peculiar sculpture that 
looms over the roiling waters in the basin. The azers originally 
sculpted it to resemble a mass of twisting, leaping flames, but the 
acidic waters of the geyser have eroded away most of the stone, leaving 
behind a vaguely serpent-shaped mass with a gaping hole at one end that 
resembles a dragon's jaws. The geyser periodically sends gouts of 
scalding steam out through this vent.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 chamber containing the basin can be located just about anywhere, but 
placing it underground or in a secluded desert locale is best. If 
located underground, the chamber can simply be part of a dungeon or 
cavern complex. Outdoors, the basin might be housed in a decaying stone 
building with a massive central dome or vault. In any case, the basin 
chamber's interior should be dark, dank, hot, and filled with acidic 
fumes. If located in a dungeon, the area containing the chamber should 
be at least a little foggy, and droplets of warm water should fall from 
the ceiling and run down the walls. Outdoors, the building might stand 
amid a lush grove of trees bathed in cloud of vapor that perpetually 
surrounds the area.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Setup</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs might learn about the basin by discovering a cache of goods left 
behind by the azers long ago. The goods might include a journal or map 
that shows the former colony's location. If the PCs should encounter a 
local brass dragon, they'll certainly hear a few tales of the place (see
 below). The current (and self-styled) overlord of the place, the 
efreeti Dischubba, likes to spread tales of the basin's "miraculous" 
powers. In fact, the geyser is a real danger to most residents of the 
Material Plane, but Dischubba loves to tempt gullible folk into the 
chamber, where she can overpower and enslave them. The PCs might hear 
any of the following rumors regarding the place:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dragonsbreath
 basin is in reality the grave of a great gold wyrm that literally 
melded itself into the landscape at the moment of death. The stony 
corpse of the dragon can still be seen, and from time to time, the 
dragon still breathes, much to the peril of anyone nearby.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bits
 of the dragon's vast hoard still lie in a steaming pool that surrounds 
the corpse, but families of gold dragons still lay their eggs in the 
area and jealously protect the grave. Still, the dragons also leave 
offerings to the departed dragon in the pool, and a clever thief could 
not only stash up some valuables, but also come away with a dragon egg 
or two.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dragonsbreath
 basin is a place of eldritch power that is guarded by vengeful spirits.
 Some say, however, that a meek person can pass by the spirits and can 
gain a wish simply by casting three pieces of sun-warmed gold into the 
basin -- the size of the golden objects need only match one's desire for
 the wish.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dragonsbreath
 basin marked the center of an ancient dwarven kingdom that grew too 
rich for its own good. Greed and splendor have long since brought about 
the kingdom's downfall, but wonderful treasures await those hardy souls 
that can brave the spirits, both of fire and of long-dead dwarves, that 
haunt the place.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Dischubba
 planted these rumors, though all three have their basis in folktales 
about the place. Dischubba simply embellished them a little by adding 
the promise of treasure. She is most proud of the second rumor. 
Periodically, she lends verisimilitude to this one by actually granting a
 wish to some poor, desperate soul who comes to the place with an 
offering of gold. This ruse has netted her many offerings of gold and a 
steady supply of people to enslave.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Entering the Basin Chamber</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 chamber containing the basin and its geyser-turned-fountain once had a 
stone door, but that was destroyed years ago. All that remains now is an
 open doorway, and even that has seen better days:</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tendrils
 of pale mist flow from a gaping hole framed with rock. The barest hint 
of an archway remains visible over the opening, but most of the stones 
have fallen away, leaving an irregular outline of pitted rock that 
resembles rotten wood more than solid stone. Chunks of fallen masonry 
lie scattered about, their edges curiously rounded, as though worn away 
by wind or water. The air here has an acrid stench with just a hint of 
sulfur -- or perhaps of rotting flesh. </span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The stonework in the archway is not altogether safe. The noise of battle or an energy spell such as a <i>lighting bolt</i> or <i>fireball</i> striking the doorway can shake loose some stones, making the doorway a hazardous place to stand in a battle.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 a melee develops near the door, there is a 1-in-6 chance each round 
that loose stones fall from the doorway, dealing 2d8 points of damage to
 anyone within 10 feet of the door. A Reflex save (DC 18) reduces damage
 by half. A blow with a weapon or an energy spell striking the top of 
the door automatically shakes loose the stones. Once the stone falls, 
there is no further danger from the stonework (at least for the moment).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 character with the stonecunning ability can make a Search or Spot check
 (DC 15) to notice the loose stones, as can a rogue or character with 
the ability to find traps.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 8, 9, or 10):</b> At least one janni, or sometimes two or three always lurk near the doorway ready to "welcome" visitors to the chamber,</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jann (1-3):</b> hp 33 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>One
 janni remains visible just inside the door while its comrades (if any) 
stay in the chamber, both invisible and out of the line of sight for 
anyone outside. The visible janni poses as a human commoner, Vizen bin 
Arneb, who has journeyed to the chamber to cast a few golden rings into 
the basin and gain a wish. He is loathe to explain the nature of his 
wish, as that might jinx his quest. Vizen is happy to explain the tale 
of the wishes if the PCs have not heard it. Vizen also confesses to the 
PCs that he is loathe to give up his three golden rings (one is his 
wedding band), for he now doubts that he could gain a wish at all. (This
 is one true element of his tale. The janni cannot get a wish, because 
it is Dischubba who grants the wishes here and the efreeti cannot grant 
wishes to other genies.)</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 the PCs believe Vizen's tale, the janni confesses that he fears to 
fully enter the chamber because he has heard other tales of powerful and
 malignant spirits within, and yet he begs the PCs not to enter the 
chamber just yet, since that may interfere with the granting of his 
wish. It is Vizen's plan to hem and haw a long as he can until he drives
 the PCs mad with waiting and they eventually push their way into the 
chamber without being properly prepared for a fight.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Should the PCs attack Vizen, the janni uses his flying ability to get out of reach, then <i>enlarges</i>
 himself and tries to harry the party from the air with his longbow. If 
Vizen has jann allies to help out, the other jann also use their <i>enlarge</i> powers, then use their flying ability or <i>ethereal jaunt </i>powers
 to surround and flank the PCs during the ensuing fight. If he gets the 
chance, Vizen (or one of his allies) sends an arrow into the doorway to 
dump stones on characters standing nearby.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Any battle here that lasts more than 2 rounds brings Dischubba from the next chamber.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Inside the Chamber</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The chamber where the basin lies is hot, steamy, and thoroughly uncomfortable:</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Within
 the chamber beyond the opening, the stench is even stronger. The air is
 hot and humid, but it isn't just heat that burns the nose and throat; 
the air in here seems caustic.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 chamber is perhaps an easy bowshot across, with a vaulted ceiling 
dripping with moisture and a slick stone floor. All the stone in here 
looks heavily pitted.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 heat and moisture seem to come from a vast, irregular pool of simmering
 water that lies in the center of the chamber, filling perhaps a third 
of the floor space. Here and there, the remains of a low stone wall 
stand at the pool's edges. Elsewhere, chunks of broken stone lie half 
submerged in the water, forming a rough circle within the much larger 
pool.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 massive stone statue rises in serpentine curves from the center of the 
pool. The sculpture seems mostly featureless, but it seems to have a 
massive, toothy maw where steam emerges with a steady hiss. The water 
just below the statue seems calmer and clearer than the rest of the 
pool, and many bright flecks of gold seem to lie around the statue's 
base.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 basin was once a round pool lined with a low stone wall, but the acidic
 waters of the pool have eaten way most of the wall, letting the waters 
spread over the chamber. The water is not boiling; the "simmering" is 
actually gas escaping from the bottom of the pool, and it is this gas 
that makes the water acid.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 water is scalding hot, though, and also highly corrosive. Just touching
 the water results in 1 point of fire damage and 1 point of acid damage.
 Immersion in the pool results of 1d6 points or fire and 1d6 points of 
acid damage each round.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 addition, the geyser erupts without fail every 7 minutes. The geyser 
files the whole chamber with boiling, acidic vapor, which deals 3d6 
points of fire damage and 1d6 points of acid damage to everyone in the 
chamber. A Reflex saves (DC 20) reduces damage by half.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 gold at the base of the statue is genuine. Dischubba dropped a few 
coins and trinkets here to lend credence to the stories about casting 
gold in the pool to gain a wish.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 8, 9, or 10):</b> Dischubba makes her lair in a side chamber not far from the basin with one janni attendant.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Janni:</b> hp 33; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Efreeti:</b> hp 65; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 When Dischubba hears Vizen speaking to visitors at the door, she 
becomes invisible and moves into the main chamber, where she observes 
the action. If anyone enters the chamber without fighting the jann at 
the door, Dischubba uses her <i>permanent image </i>ability to form the 
ghostly image of a golden dragon around the statue in the pool. Upon 
seeing this, Vizen immediately throws himself to the ground, groveling 
and begging for his life. The "dragon" scolds the PCs for entering its 
tomb bearing weapons and demands that all weapons be immediately cast 
into the pool. If the PCs comply, Dischubba attacks with an evil chuckle
 using the tactics described below. Anything cast into the pool takes 
fire and acid damage reach round (the acid, however, does not harm 
gold).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Should a fight break out at the doorway. Dischubba takes to the air, using her <i>wall of fire</i> ability to separate the party, then uses <i>produce flame</i> to attack an armored character. If necessary, she enters melee herself.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All
 the genies, and particularly Dischubba, are well aware of the geyser's 
schedule, and they flee the chamber the round before it erupts, only to 
return to resume the fight afterwards.</span></p>
