<p align="LEFT">The cool depths of a cave hold ice sculptures year round
 -- some beautiful, some grotesque -- but all carved from blue-green ice
 that looks like a frozen bit of the sea. Each statue possesses some 
illusive, artistic quality that makes it oddly appealing, if not exactly
 lifelike. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The cave lies a short distance from an alpine glacier. A
 mile or so up slope, a finger of ice has forced its way underground, 
and the cave marks its farthest advance south. Inside, one finds a 
cluster of limestone chambers near the cave mouth and ice chambers 
farther back. During the warm months, an icy stream flows from the cave 
mouth, fed by melt water from the subterranean glacier. During the 
cooler portion of the year, the ice advances a little and the stream 
dries up.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The cave has one permanent resident, Kaddmeia 
Elthaneios, a fiendish medusa who has created the sculptures. Kaddmeia 
loves to preserve some of the creatures that fall victim to her 
petrifying gaze, as many medusas do. Kaddmeia keeps those victims she 
finds the most comely, and also those whose postures she finds 
appealing. She considers herself an artist, however, and frequently 
takes the time to pose her victims in some unusual or macabre pose 
before unleashing her gaze attack. Not content to simply decorate her 
lair with stone statues, Kaddmeia first stains her work with a sea green
 hue, then carefully sprinkles the statues with water. When the water 
freezes, the statue has a mantle of ice and it looks exactly like an ice
 sculpture chipped from blue-green ice.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Kaddmeia shares her cave with a fiendish harpy, Rhiannon
 Roe, and the pair has allied themselves with a tribe of grimlocks that 
dwell in the lightless caverns below their cave.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Kaddmeia and Rhiannon have fled their native marshes for
 a cooler, drier mountain climate. Kaddmeia thinks they both have a 
little ice devil in their blood. They pose as two elderly human sisters:
 one nearly blind, the other crippled. They seem to make a scanty living
 selling ice from a pool in their cave. In reality, the "sisters" use 
their ice business to get news from the towns below them. They and their
 grimlock allies attack travelers passing though the area (usually in 
the dead of night) and occasionally raid neighboring farms and 
settlements. This far, they successfully have blamed the raids on orcs 
and even giants living high in the mountains.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The cave is best located in a mountainous or arctic 
area, but one not too far from civilization. A mountain range that marks
 the border between two counties would be ideal.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Though Kaddmeia and Rhiannon try to keep a low profile, 
they have achieved considerable notoriety in the area where they live. 
Everyone knows about the two weird sisters who share an icy cold cave 
and peddle ice to the cities and towns below. If the PCs listen to the 
local tales, they might hear any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yup, we've got an icehouse to keep everything fresh and cold. We get
 a shipment every month from the weird sisters on the mountain. People 
say those two have ice in their veins. They live in a cave of ice and 
never come out 'cept in winter. Now that's not true at all. Why just 
last month that Kaddmeia was here, half-blind as she is, seeing that a 
shipment came in all right.<br><br></li>
<li>Ice is all those weird sisters think about. They live in a cave full
 of ice and they peddle it. When they're not selling it, they're carving
 it. Folks say their place is chock full of ice statues -- which must be
 something to see.<br><br></li>
<li>The weird sisters aren't really sisters at all. Some folks say 
they're a pair of witches or sorcerers who do ice magic all day. That's 
how they make their famous ice sculptures. They're crazy about those 
silly ice statues. Never want to sell a single one of them, even though 
they'd make a pile more money than they do now just selling plain ice. 
Many folks think the sisters must be a pair of retired adventurers 
living up there with all the loot they collected over the years.<br><br></li>
<li>Selling ice is just a cover for the weird sisters. What they really 
have up there is a diamond mine. Folks who've been hunting up there say 
the whole area is peppered with deep, deep holes where blind miners work
 in utter darkness, digging out gems for the sisters. Folks who get too 
snoopy go into the holes and never come out again. They just stay down 
there and dig until they go blind from want of light. Years ago, some 
cocky group (an elf, a human, a dwarf, and a halfling) went up there to 
find out what was going on. They were never seen alive again, but my 
cousin swears he was up there getting ice one day and saw all four of 
'em all carved outta ice.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs could simply come across the cave while 
traveling through the mountains, though it's more likely that the pair's
 grimlock allies attack during the night, perhaps with Kaddmeia or 
Rhiannon in support (probably the latter if the attack occurs on a dark 
night). The PCs might then track any surviving grimlocks (or perhaps a 
cohort or comrade who has fallen prey to Rhiannon's captivating song) 
back to the cave.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Entering the Cave</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The following text assumes the PCs visit the cave in 
winter. An icy stream flows from the cave the other three seasons of the
 year. If the PCs visit the cave during a hot day, all the ice in the 
cave generates a thick, white mist that rises in clouds from the cave 
mouth.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#E9E9E9" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#E9E9E9" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">A rocky cave mouth opens from a snowy hillside. The 
ribbon of glistening ice emerges from the opening and meanders down the 
hillside in erratic loops before vanishing under a snowdrift. Clusters 
of gleaming figures stand on either side of the ice, nearly invisible 
under the shelter of the cave. The figures seem lifelike. A few seem to 
stare in wonderment into the distance, but most appear locked in wild, 
but frozen action -- oddly animated, but motionless all the same. All 
the figures appear as silent and still as the icy landscape surrounding 
them.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Kaddmeia has left some two dozen figures at the cave 
mouth. Most of them are her petrified victims disguised as ice 
sculptures as described in the Background section. A few, however, are 
genuine ice sculptures. If the PCs examine all the statues closely, 
they'll notice that few of them (the ones made wholly out of ice) are 
much lighter than the rest. A round or so of chipping at a disguised 
statue removes its icy shell and reveals the painted stone beneath. All 
the sculptures look slightly less lifelike when viewed up close. They 
have a thick-featured, chunky look. Nevertheless, they're undeniably 
appealing.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond the cave mouth and its collection of statues, 
visitors find a vast chamber floored with a sheet of ice. More statues 
(disguised as ice sculptures) are scattered throughout. There also is a 
vast pile of ice blocks and a frozen pool from which the ice blocks have
 been sawn. The floor in here is fairly slippery. Creatures can walk in 
here at half normal speed. Moving at full speed, charging, or running 
requires a balance check (DC 15), or the creature falls prone. Kaddmeia 
wears spiked shoes that allow her to move normally without Balance 
checks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Openings lead farther into the cave, where Kaddmeia and 
Rhiannon have their personal chambers. The "sisters" also have a 
storeroom. The depths of the cave are solid ice. Several ice chambers 
are empty and one is stocked with discarded statues (more of Kaddmeia's 
victims). The whole cave complex runs about a quarter mile back into the
 slope before it completely dead ends against the glacier.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures (EL 8, 9, 10, or 11):</b> Kaddmeia and 
Rhiannon live here year round, with occasional visits from their 
grimlock allies. Two versions of Kaddmeia are presented here, one with a
 few sorcerer levels, and one without. If the PCs have previously met 
and killed Rhiannon, Kaddmeia is here with some grimlock bodyguards.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Captivating Song (Su): </b>When Rhiannon sings, all 
creatures (other than harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a
 DC 17 Will save or become captivated. This is a sonic mind-affecting 
charm effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected 
again by the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A captivated victim walks 
toward Rhiannon, taking the most direct route available. If the path 
leads into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff, or the like), 
that creature gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can take 
no actions other than to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter cannot run 
away or attack but takes no defensive penalties.) A victim within 5 feet
 of Rhiannon stands there and offers no resistance to the monster's 
attacks. The effect continues for as long as she sings and for 1 round 
thereafter. A bard's countersong ability allows the captivated creature 
to attempt a new Will save.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Smite Good (Su): </b>Once per day Rhiannon can make a normal melee attack to deal +7 points of extra damage against a good foe.</p>

the depth of the cave. Kaddmeia appears in a shabby peasant dress and a 
hooded shawl. She stoops and has a visible hump at the left shoulder. 
Under her hood, dark glasses are visible. (These neutralize her gaze 
attack while she wears them.) Kaddmeia does her best to win the PCs 
confidence. Read or paraphrase the following.</p>

somewhere? It's a sad thing to get old, you know . . . never seem to

did you know that? Shocks your digestive system into working a bit 
harder."</p>

<p align="LEFT">Kaddmeia happily chats with the PCs while sizing them 
up. She mentions the following in answer to appropriate questions or to 
make small talk as needed."Oh, you've seen my sculptures! My sister says
 I could have been a famous artist, and there do seem to be plenty of 
people willing to offer money my statues. But I just sculpt for my own 
pleasure and the joy the finished statues bring to me and my sister in 
our declining years."</p>
<ul>
<li>"I suppose we could make more money selling statues than ice, but 
our needs are simple and few. We have more than enough customers to 
support ourselves, and the ice is easy to come by, though a bit too 
heavy for the two of us to extract at times. Some nice boys downstairs 
sometimes help us with that part."<br><br></li>
<li>"Why live in an ice cave? Well, comfort, for one thing. We enjoy the
 cool, crisp air, and there's nothing like icepacks to help rheumatism. 
It's cheap, too. My sister and I are poor, and we can't afford to pay 
the kind of rent they charge in town. Furthermore, it's very safe. It's 
amazing how few of the criminal types that prey on older folk are 
unwilling to come up here."</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> If the PCs get suspicious, or if Kaddmeia decides she'd
 like to add a PC to her collection, she whips off her dark glasses (a 
free action) and looses her gaze attack. She uses her spiked shoes to 
keep her distance from the PCs. She keeps up a steady fire from her bow 
(her quiver and bow make the hump under her shawl). If you're using the 
sorcerer version of Kaddmeia, she protects herself with a <i>shield</i> spell and drops the occasional <i>charm person</i> spell on characters that get too close.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While Kaddmeia fights, Rhiannon starts her captivating 
song from the depths of the cave (she sings Kaddmeia a few bars each 
morning to give her temporary immunity). If Rhiannon draws someone away 
from the fight, she tries to push the victim into an icy sinkhole, then 
flies to the main chamber to assist Rhiannon in the fight. She averts 
her eyes from the medusa and keeps up a steady fire with her crossbow.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If Rhiannon is not present, Kaddmeia's grimlock 
bodyguards lie low until trouble begins, then they move into the main 
chamber, wearing spiked shoes so they can move normally, and try to 
engage the PCs in melee while also staying between the party and 
Kaddmeia.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Cave as a Happier Place</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Kaddmeia and Rhiannon don't have to be nasty monsters. 
They could, for example, be pair of fairly young silver dragons (perhaps
 young or juvenile) just keeping an eye on things. As a dragon, Kaddmeia
 could still be an artist and sculptor, but she would work only in ice 
from the cave (which might naturally have a blue-green color from 
minerals in the area). A dragon version of Kaddmeia might be willing to 
sell her work to help build her treasure hoard.</p>
