<p align="LEFT">To remain at the height of fashion, one must visit the 
House of Metege often, if not regularly. This impeccable clothing store 
and haberdashery offers only the finest goods that are always 
individually crafted for each customer. But what secrets lie behind the 
fa√ßade?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2011-21%20-%20The%20House%20of%20Metege_files/VV_Nov03.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="215" width="186">The
 House of Metege sells fine apparel of all kinds, from hats to shoes, 
and from silk shirts to fur coats, for both men and women. If also 
offers accessories and personal items, such as jewelry, cologne, and 
cosmetics. The House of Metege concerns itself with the customer's 
overall appearance and also offers hairdressing and other grooming 
services for both men and women. The House of Metege caters to wealthy 
customers with a discriminating sense of style, but it also provides 
advice for those clients whose tastes don't quite match what they can 
afford.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Metege, the haberdasher, has established himself as the 
leading authority on matters of fashion and personal style in the city, 
and indeed the whole region where his sprawling shop is located. 
Needless to say, Metege is hardly the typical merchant. Besides being 
successful, widely admired (and nearly as widely envied or resented), 
Metege is a gnome with a reputation for energy and single-minded 
tenacity. Local tales say Metege began his career as a common peddler 
selling wares made by his own hand out of a backpack. Through sheer hard
 work and determination, say the tales, Metege built his business into 
the respected institution it is today. This tale is largely of Metege's 
own invention. In fact, Metege is a semi-retired adventurer who could 
spin many true tales of derring-do. Metege built up his business by 
carefully investing the profits from his adventuring career. For reasons
 of his own (which will become obvious in a moment) Metege has chosen to
 keep his true past hidden.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Metege's role as an arbiter of good taste and as a 
trusted advisor on all things related to personal style places him in a 
unique position to observe the rich and powerful in his city. Both he 
and his employees pick of a steady stream of useful political, economic,
 and even military information, and Metege passes it on, discreetly, to 
some of his other clients. The DM can decide whether Metege's espionage 
activities are noble or simply mercenary. Perhaps Metege passes his 
information on to the local government, which in turn uses it benignly 
to keep the peace and to detect any undue foreign influences. Or perhaps
 Metege is a foreign spy, gathering information as a prelude to war. He 
also may sell what he knows to the highest bidder, fueling bitter and 
deadly rivalries among the noble houses.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The House of Metege also has another sideline, and a 
tawdry one by any estimation. Trusted clients rely on the House of 
Metege to help them simply disappear for varying periods of time. For a 
fee, a client can receive a well-crafted disguise and a new public 
identity (usually one well below the client's usual social station). For
 an extra free, the client also can purchase the services of a double, 
who will go forth to perform the client's usual daily activities. This 
allows the client to effectively be in two places at once. The service 
is quite popular with bored spouses in the city, who send their doubles 
off to do their daily errands while they slip away to their secret 
assignations. Other clients of the House of Metege use the service to 
confuse their business rivals. In any case, Metege finds that his role 
as a purveyor of disguises and false identities helps his espionage 
activities immensely, and it also puts him in a position to influence or
 blackmail some of the most powerful families in his city. Again, the DM
 can decide what spin to put on this aspect of Metege's business. The 
old gnome might simply be making some extra money from his particular 
areas of expertise, or he might be planning something more sinister. Or 
perhaps the House of Metege is merely a front for a guild of thieves or 
assassins.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The doubles Metege employs usually are bards or rogues 
who simply act their parts with the benefit of a disguise Metege 
provides. However, Metege also may use spellcasters who in turn use <i>disguise self </i>or <i>alter self </i>spells, or even doppelgangers or other shapechangers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>About Metege</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Metege began his career as scout and guardian for his 
home community of rock gnomes. His post being largely honorary, Metege 
was obliged to supplement his meager income through hunting and 
trapping. He sold most of his pelts and meat in a neighboring human 
community. Metege quickly learned that he much preferred the thrill of 
the hunt (and of the kill) to the tedious job of safeguarding his fellow
 gnomes. He also learned that he preferred cold, hard cash to the 
gratitude of his peers and the blessings of his elders. Several 
different versions of Metege are presented below, in keeping with the 
various ways you might want to use him in your campaign. In any case, 
Metege keeps his true past a secret, and he finds that the guise of a 
hardworking gnome merchant who stays focused on matters of style and 
taste thoroughly obscures his more nefarious activities. No matter which
 version of Metege you choose, customers buying their clothes at the 
House of Metege meet an affable fellow with an air of refinement and a 
person who is utterly unpretentious despite his obvious wealth and his 
exclusive clientele. Metege has a dark side, however, and in most cases,
 that is the real Metege. </p>

<p align="LEFT">This version of Metege represents him as an adventurer 
turned merchant/spy, but not necessarily as an evil or dangerous person.
 The listed alignment is neutral, but this version could just as well be
 chaotic good or neutral evil. In the former case, Metege is likely very
 picky about whom he allows to use his disguise service, and he most 
likely refuses to help anyone deceive a spouse except in extreme cases 
in which a spouse is abusive or obviously mismatched.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As an evil character at this stage, Metege is more 
likely to operate as a front for a group of thieves or assassins. His 
intimate knowledge of the city's wealthiest people (right down to their 
measurements) makes him a key link in all manners of deceptions and 
chicanery.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In any case, this Metege tends to avoid combat. If 
forced to fight, he tries to keep his distance and use ranged attacks. 
He relies on a cadre of guards for protection. His complement of guards 
contains mostly human fighters of level 3 or so, but also wizards of 
similar level. Depending on his other activities, he might have a few 
rogues or bards on call as well. </p>

<p align="LEFT">Here we see Metege as a person who developed a taste for
 cloak and dagger activities fairly early in his career. This is a much 
more deadly Metege, but one still well suited for his double life. (He 
still has many of the same skills as the previous version, but his rogue
 levels make him more formidable in a fight.) His alignment is neutral, 
but this version could just as well be or good or evil, as noted above. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In a fight, this Metege still prefers to keep his 
distance, but he's not afraid to get in close if he has to, especially 
if he can deliver a sneak attack or two. He uses his Tumble skill to 
avoid dangerous foes or to set up sneak attacks, as the need arises. His
 complement of personal guards contains mostly fighters, but possibly 
also rogues and bards, as noted previously. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Death Attack:</b> If Metege studies his victim for 3 
rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that 
successfully deals damage, he can attempt to either paralyze or kill his
 target. The victim must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 16). Failure 
against the kill effect means the target dies; failure against the 
paralysis effect means the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act
 for 1d6 rounds plus 5 rounds. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, 
the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once Metege has completed the 3
 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 
rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her 
save) or if Metege does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of 
completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can 
attempt another death attack. </p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> Metege can use body language, 
vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal. This 
ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of
 a person. His bonus on the check is +6. The typical domestic animal has
 a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually 
unfriendly. The ranger and the animal must study each other for 1 
minute. This ability can also be used to influence a magical beast with 
an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but Metege takes a -4 penalty on the 
check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Assassin Spells Known</b> (4/2; save DC 13 + spell level): 1st -- <i>feather fall, jump, sleep, true strike;</i> 2nd -- <i>invisibility, spider climb, undetectable alignment.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Possessions: </b><i>+2 amulet of natural armor, +2 bracers of armor, +2 ring of protection,</i> masterwork composite longbow (+1 Strength), 10 <i>+1 arrows,</i><i>+1 longsword, cloak of Charisma +4</i>.</p>

<p align="LEFT">This version shows Metege as an efficient killer as well
 as an entrepreneur and spy. Metege remains the affable merchant and 
retains his business acumen, but all that is merely a screen for his 
dark side. The listed alignment is neutral evil, and this fits him best.
 He is utterly without compassion or mercy, but he is neither prone to 
self-indulgence nor overly devoted to acquiring personal power or 
maintaining a sense of order. As presented here, Metege is best used as 
the leader of a secret gang of assassins, spies, or thieves (or perhaps 
just as the accomplished front man for such an organization).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Metege presented here is utterly fearless in combat,
 though he is capable of realizing when he is in over his head so that 
he can do something to escape. He prefers to begin a confrontation with a
 long negotiation (the better to size up the opposition and perhaps to 
set up a death attack). His personal bodyguards include fighters of 
around 7th level, and a collection of fellow rogues and assassins, plus a
 spellcaster or two.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs might become familiar with the House of Metege 
without realizing what's really going on there for quite some time. 
After all, it seems just like a normal business. But any of the 
following situations might cause the PCs to take a closer look.</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs receive invitations to a fancy ball (or perhaps to a costume
 ball). If they have made friends with a wealthy or noble NPC, the 
invitation might be strictly social, or the PCs might be asked to 
provide security or to guard a particular person. If they accept, the 
PCs are told that they must acquire proper attire for the affair, and 
they're advised to visit the House of Metege, which is the absolute best
 formal outfitter in town. At the House of Metege, the PCs are fitted 
for suitable clothes (at masterwork prices), but only after answering 
dozens of questions about the affair and their role in it. If the PCs 
balk, they're told that the House of Metege could not possibly serve 
them correctly without understanding things from the PCs' own 
perspective. After all, personal service is what has made the House of 
Metege famous. (These questions are, of course, asked as smoothly and 
diplomatically as possible. If all else fails, the person attending them
 notes that those who sent them here fully expect to have the PCs let 
the House of Metege experts in on whatever is going on, and he or she 
also mentions that discretion is a part of the service.) The questions 
from the staff may prove innocuous, or they may serve to allow Metege 
and his thief or assassin associates to evade the PCs and successfully 
kidnap a guest or steal something during the event. (Metege would set up
 a clever ploy for covering his own business so that it evades 
suspicion, of course. He has far too much to lose if his business is 
compromised, and he'll stand down from any plans if something goes 
awry.)<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs visit the House of Metege, where they meet a boisterous 
young rake who insists upon treating the whole group to a round of 
drinks at a swanky tavern nearby. The PCs may find themselves getting 
their new acquaintance out of trouble when he (or she) insults someone 
or claims to be insulted and a brawl ensues. Later on, the PCs meet this
 person again, and he or she seems to have no clear recollection of 
their meeting. In fact, the PCs have met one of the doubles Metege 
supplies. Canny PCs might make Spot checks (use the DC needed to 
discover the original disguises, -5) to note differences between this 
person currently in their presence and their friend from the previous 
incident. The PCs may think they've spotted an imposter, but in fact 
they have discovered the original. The person in question probably won't
 want to explain the situation.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs are hired to guard or shadow someone, and their quarry leads
 them to the House of Metege, where the PCs briefly lose track of the 
subject while he or she is fitted for a new suit of clothes. A double 
replaces the subject, possibly leading the PCs astray. The original may 
have decided to evade the PCs for a time, or perhaps Metege has abducted
 the original. Or perhaps the original is secretly a member of Metege's 
organization of thieves, spies, or assassins, and he or she wishes to 
get the PCs to provide him or her with an alibi.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs are hired to locate a missing person. During an exhaustive 
search, the PCs discover that the subject visited the House of Metege 
two days before disappearing. In fact, the missing person vanished then,
 and a double impersonated the subject before vanishing as well. The 
subject may have decided to flee the city, or he or she may have been 
kidnapped.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the House of Metege</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Viewed from the street, the place has an air of 
understated elegance. It stands in the city's business district and is 
surrounded by humbler buildings. The description below assumes that the 
PCs visit the place during a weekday, when the local merchants are all 
open for business.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">The streets around you bustle with mercantile activity. 
This area seems dedicated to the textile trade. Weavers, spinners, and 
cloth merchants hawk their wares from booths and storefronts, often 
while busy at the loom or spinning wheel, or while plying their needles.
 Amid all the hurly burly stands a handsome stone building at least 
three stories high. Rounded turrets (with peaked roofs) at each corner 
make the place look a little like a castle. Wide stone steps lead up 
from the street to a pair of immaculate hardwood doors with polished 
brass fittings. A pair of equally immaculate footmen flanks the door.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The keystone above the doorway gleams pure white, and a 
rune on the keystone looks a little bit like a stylized letter "M." Rows
 of windows at street level are covered in fancy wrought iron grilles 
with the "M" rune worked into their design. The upper windows (and there
 are many) have no grilles. Heavy velvet curtains frame all the windows.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A peek into a lower window usually reveals workers busy 
crafting clothes or shoes. All the workers seem keenly alert, and 
someone is likely to give a smile and a wave to anyone peering in. The 
upper windows show only carpeted hallways running around the building's 
outer perimeter. Anyone ascending the stairs gets a hearty greeting 
("Welcome to the House of Metege") as the footmen open the doors. 
Regular customers are always greeted by name unless they are disguised.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond the double doors lies a comfortable sitting room 
with a crystal chandelier, a pair of marble fireplaces, and several 
extremely comfortable couches and chairs. Customers are expected to 
enter and sit at ease until an employee can wait on them. Most clients 
don't have to wait long for service, but refreshments are provided 
anyway, as an extra courtesy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A PC's visit to the House of Metege might go something like this.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">The crystal chandelier casts shafts of sparkling light 
about the opulent sitting room. On a low table next to a plush red sofa 
are several platters full of dainty cakes, cookies, and vegetables 
carved into fanciful shapes. Crystal carafes of white wine and glasses 
await customers on an intricately carved stand.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Welcome to the House of Metege," says a female elf with
 a parchment and pen in her hand. Her robe is pale shade of lavender 
that sets off her perfectly coifed silvery hair. A rope of small 
amethysts and opals is wound through her tresses. "Are you quite 
comfortable?" she asks solicitously. "I am called Moonglow. I just have a
 few questions for you before your consultation with Metege."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Moonglow settles onto an overstuffed chair. "Now, I 
presume you want a full makeover? I'm sure Metege can address some of 
your . . . issues . . . with style," she says, making rapid notes on the
 parchment. "Are you going to a special event? Do you have . . . 
business dealings . . . for which you need to make the right 
impression?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">"My dear Wilhelmina," says a loud voice from the end of 
the room, "Metege does not follow styles. Metege MAKES style!" A 
stylishly dressed gnome leads a human woman of ample proportions into 
the room by the elbow. "Now don't you worry about a thing, my dear," 
coos the gnome reassuringly. "Red was never your color; I couldn't 
possibly allow you to wear that frock you had on when you arrived for 
another moment! You need cool tones . . . like the sea . . . to bring 
out the dewy glow of your complexion and the clear blue of your eyes," 
he continues, stroking the fabric of the woman's blue-green gown. "And 
pearls," he continues. "Pearls for the bodice, the hem, and the 
all-important tiara," he says, tapping his head and smiling 
ingratiatingly. "You'll be a new woman when Metege is through with you."</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Oh Metege!" cries the woman ecstatically. "Sequina was 
right -- I don't know why I waited so long to come to you! Pearls, you 
say? Oh . . ." The woman twirls in place. "I feel just like the belle of
 the ball!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">"And so you will be, my dear," says Metege, bowing low. "Until next week then. You won't recognize yourself in your new gowns!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">The woman smiles again and departs as Metege's gaze 
swings toward Moonglow. "And what have we here? Oh my! You DO need the 
great Metege, don't you? Moonglow, go and get the fitting room ready -- 
hop to it now! Tell the tailors it's an emergency! I'll need some black 
velvet, some fine white silk, some soft suede. . . . Well don't stand 
there gawking! Hurry up!"</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A veritable army of employees swings into action at 
Metege's command. Characters who come to the House of Metege on business
 other than getting their personal images revamped probably will get 
revamped anyway (and receive a bill for a kingly sum) unless they 
quickly and firmly refuse the service and state their true business.</p>
