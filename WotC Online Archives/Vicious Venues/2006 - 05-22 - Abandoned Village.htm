<p align="center"><i>The Abandoned Village contains encounters of level 1-9 and is suitable for use with any <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i><img src="2006%20-%2005-22%20-%20Abandoned%20Village_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></i></p>
<p align="LEFT">A cluster of decrepit buildings stands in an otherwise 
empty landscape. The structures seem to have a human scale (judging from
 the size and height of the empty doorways and windows). Most of the 
buildings lost their roofs long ago, and their interiors stand open to 
the elements. Vines, weeds, and mosses cover almost everything. Still, 
traces of narrow streets remain visible between the empty walls, and the
 faint lines of an unused crossroads pass through the site. It will be a
 few years yet before nature fully reclaims the place.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The ruin was once Darow's Crossing, an agricultural 
settlement named for the explorer who first surveyed the abandoned roads
 that meet at the site. The residents were mostly human, with a few 
other humanoid races mixed in, as is typical for an isolated community. 
The village might have been deserted for several reasons. A drought, 
plague, or other natural disaster might have killed the residents or 
driven them off. A sudden attack from a powerful monster (such as a 
dragon) could have destroyed the place. If so, a close examination of 
the ruins should reveal some traces of the creature -- such as scorch 
marks from a red dragon or other fire breather or a few boulders lodged 
in walls from a giant's attack. Or perhaps something sent the place into
 a long decline, such as a succession of bad harvests, the aftereffects 
of a war, or a series of bandit raids that eventually wore down the 
residents.</p>
<p align="LEFT">No matter what brought about its demise, Darow's Crossing still has a few residents.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The place is laid out along the crossroads in a ragged 
"X" shape. There are about four dozen ruined cottages lined up along the
 two roads. Some larger buildings are set back from the crossroads so 
that cottages surround them on two sides.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Beyond the village lie four big fields separated by tall
 hedgerows. The villagers worked these fields in rotation, using one 
field as a pasture and the other three for crops each year. The fields 
are mostly filled with weeds now, but a few hardy examples of the old 
crops remain (mostly wheat, oats, and barley gone wild).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cottages: </b> These buildings were each about 25 
feet square. They originally had walls made from local stone and plank 
or thatched roofs. Inside, each had a stone fireplace and chimney. 
Outside, the cottages had wooden doors and shutters. Every cottage also 
had a small root cellar lined with stone and accessed from outside via a
 stone stairway and a wooden trapdoor. These days, only the stonework 
survives (though most of the chimneys have fallen). The cellars are 
(mostly) still accessible, though weeds and shrubs screen the entrances 
from view.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Barns: </b> There are two stone barns with slate 
roofs mostly intact. Each is about 50 feet long and 30 feet wide. The 
barns have two stories; the ground floors still have wooden stalls for 
livestock, and a few rusty farm implements hang from the walls. The 
upper floors were used to store fodder and bedding for the animals, and a
 few wisps of hay and straw still lie in the lofts.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Granary:</b> This structure looks like a row of three
 stone beehives, each about 15 feet in diameter at the base and about 25
 feet high. The three sections once held dried grain. Today, they hold 
nothing but dust and old rodent droppings.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shrine:</b> This fortresslike structure is 40 feet 
long and 30 feet wide. It is one story high and made from extra large 
stone blocks. It has a flat roof ringed with crenellations, and narrow 
windows that resemble arrowslits. The residents used this place for 
worship, public meetings, and as a rally point in case of danger or 
attack. Inside, the shrine has a large meeting room with a stone altar 
at one end. The rest of the place is a suite of three rooms for the 
presiding priest.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Vaults below the meeting hall contain burial crypts.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spring House:</b> This low stone building is only a 
half story high and some 15 feet square. A short flight of steps leads 
down about 5 feet to a stone floor. A raised basin, also stone, takes up
 most of the chamber. The basin holds clear, cool water (and maybe a few
 aquatic bugs). A channel leading outside sends overflow from the basin 
trickling downhill in a thin stream that eventually vanishes into a 
swampy area.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs first 
approach the village. The text assumes that the season is late spring or
 early summer. Adjust accordingly for a different time of year. The 
hedges bordering the fields make the area around the village look pretty
 much the same no matter what the surrounding terrain looks like, though
 in a very arid region, tumbleweeds or drifting sand should replace most
 of the plant life.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The trail takes a sharp bend and turns up a low hill. 
Abruptly, the path broadens into a semblance of a road -- unpaved, but 
with a hardpan surface. A gentle curve takes a traveler through a gap in
 a tall, thorny hedge. Beyond lies a weed-choked field. Down the road 
lies a collection of weatherworn buildings, mostly roofless.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters might meet almost anything in the 
village; here are some possibilities at several different encounter 
levels. For a more complex and dangerous encounter (or to use the 
village as a site for an entire adventure), several of these creatures 
might occupy the village at the same time. The more intelligent among 
them will work together against invaders. Even the dumb brutes will tend
 to be drawn toward any battle that erupts, hoping for a share of the 
spoils.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Goblins (EL 1-3)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">These creatures have connected several of the root 
cellars under the cottages (and possibly the vaults under the shrine) 
with a series of tunnels. They stay underground during the day, but keep
 sentries posted in the upper floors of the barns to watch for 
intruders. They dug tunnels leading to both barns so the sentries can 
come and go without being seen or exposing themselves to daylight.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Goblins (4-9):</b> hp 5 each; <i>MM</i> 133.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The goblins prefer to lie low and allow 
visitors to pass by them. They'll attack, however, if someone spots a 
sentry or discovers one of their tunnels. If unsuspecting travelers pass
 through the village during the day, the goblins might track them down 
and attack during the night, most likely during the darkest hour. 
They'll certainly attack anyone camping inside the village overnight.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In a fight, the goblins toss their javelins at whatever 
targets present them with clear shots. After the volley of javelins, the
 goblins scatter and try to hide amid the ruined buildings and weeds. If
 pursued, one or two goblins stand and fight while the rest try to 
circle behind the party and attack their rear ranks.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolf Skeletons (EL 3-5)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">These creatures were animated from the remains of wolves
 the villagers killed while defending their livestock. Their creator 
might have been a necromancer who used the village as a base for awhile,
 or he might be a current resident (see the Goblin Adept entry, below). 
The skeletal wolves prowl the outskirts of the village, day and night. 
They'll attack any living creature they meet, except goblins.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolf Skeletons (2-6):</b> hp 13 each; <i>MM </i>133.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The mindless skeletons simply attack the closest foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bugbear Zombies (EL 4-7)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">These creatures were once allies (or masters) of the 
local goblin tribe. As with the skeletons, the zombies' creator might 
have been a necromancer who used the village as a base for awhile. Or a 
current resident might have created the zombies (see the Goblin Adept 
entry, below).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bugbear Zombies (2-6): </b>hp 42 each; <i>MM </i>267.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>The mindless zombies simply attack the closest foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Werewolves (EL 5-9)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This troupe of lycanthropes has a few companion wolves. 
An onslaught by these creatures (or their ancestors) might have 
destroyed the village, or the werewolves might simply find the place a 
good place for a lair. They and their wolves have taken up residence in 
the shrine.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Werewolves (2-5):</b> hp 20 each; <i>MM</i> 175.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wolves (5-8): </b>hp 13 each; <i>MM </i>283.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The werewolves start in their human 
forms and pose as prospectors, trappers, or treasure hunters. They 
pretend to welcome any visitors to the village, such as the PCs. The 
werewolves claim they've had nobody to talk to -- except each other -- 
for much too long. (That might be completely true.) They drop a few 
hints that suggest they have a big secret, but seem reluctant to divulge
 it -- at least at first. After pretending to debate for awhile, they 
eventually offer the PCs a cut of their action. If the PCs press for 
details, the werewolves simply say that they have discovered a great 
treasure (they have in the form of the PCs and their goods).</p>
<p align="LEFT">The werewolves keep their wolves out of sight, probably 
in the vaults beneath the shrine. Once they have the PCs at ease, they 
make an excuse to slip out -- perhaps to fetch food or drink. Once out 
of sight, they shift to hybrid form and return to attack. Their wolves 
accompany them. Once a fight begins, the lycanthropes send their wolves 
against the party's fighting types while they attempt to slay the 
group's spellcasters. If they can't break through to the spellcasters, 
they switch to wolf form and use their bite and trip attacks against the
 front line.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Goblin Adept (EL 8)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Hoggnos, a goblin adept, has moved into the village, 
bringing his four goblin warrior bodyguards and his familiar, Phester, 
with him.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Hoggnos can cast the<i> animate dead</i> spell and he 
could have created the wolf skeletons and bugbear zombies mentioned 
earlier. If so, Hoggnos might call on those undead creatures for extra 
muscle in a fight. He and his living troops also might move in and 
ambush anyone who attacks the undead.</p>

If they anticipate a fight coming, the bodyguards drink their <i>haste</i> potions, and Hoggnos gives Phester his <i>potion of</i><i>mage armor.</i> Then the whole group finds a place to hide and ambush the foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Whenever a fight begins, Hoggnos casts <i>lightning bolt</i>
 on the biggest group of enemies, and the bodyguards shoot arrows at 
what they judge to be the most vulnerable targets. After that, the whole
 group falls back, with the bodyguards keeping themselves between the 
foe and Hoggnos. The bodyguards keep shooting and Hoggnos uses the rest 
of his spells to best effect. He uses <i>web</i> if he can catch foes someplace where he can anchor the webbing (such as underground or indoors).</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the enemy gets within melee range, the bodyguards 
switch to their bastard swords, and they use their speed to set up 
flanking attacks. If a foe gets too close to Hoggnos or seems to be on 
the way to defeating his bodyguards, he casts <i>command</i> (mostly likely to flee or drop a weapon) on that opponent.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Medusas (EL 7-9)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">One or two medusas have renovated one of the cottages 
and live there, posing as ascetics. They have turned quite a few 
visitors to stone over the years. They keep their handiwork in the 
shrine or in one of the barns.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Medusas (1-2):</b> hp 33 each; <i>MM</i> 197.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The medusas pretend to be peaceful, but 
wary of visitors. They greet the PCs coolly, then bid them to go 
quietly, lest they disrupt the serenity of the ruins any further. The 
medusas use their gaze attacks at the slightest provocation from the 
PCs. They might also consider one of the PCs an "interesting specimen" 
and try to get that character alone so they can quietly petrify their 
chosen subject. In any case, the medusas are canny enough to use their 
gaze attacks against combative foes and their ranged weaponry against

<p align="LEFT"><b>Skip Williams</b> keeps busy with freelance projects for several different game companies and was the Sage of <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i> for 18 years. Skip is a co-designer of the <b>D&amp;D</b> 3rd Edition game and the chief architect of the <i>Monster Manual</i>.
 When not devising swift and cruel deaths for player characters, Skip 
putters in his kitchen or garden (rabbits and deer are not Skip's 
friends) or works on repairing and improving the century-old farmhouse 
that he shares with his wife, Penny, and a growing menagerie of pets.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Penny Williams</b> joined the roleplaying game industry as Game Questions Expert for TSR, Inc. in the 1980s. Since then, she has served as <b>RPGA</b> Network Coordinator, <i><b>Polyhedron</b></i><i>Newszine</i>
 editor, and Senior Editor and Coordinating Editor for the RPG R&amp;D 
Department at Wizards of the Coast, Inc. Now a busy freelancer, Penny 
edits for several game companies and runs the online playtesting program
 for Wizards products. When not enhancing the cruelty of the deaths PCs 
will suffer at the hands of designers, Penny puts up jam, works jigsaw 
puzzles, and tutors students in math and science.</p>
