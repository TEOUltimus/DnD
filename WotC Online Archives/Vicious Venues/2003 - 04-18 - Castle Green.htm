<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nothing
 of this ancient castle remains except for a few scattered stones and 
the faint outlines of the curtain wall and moat. Still, the place has 
its secrets.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Background for the DM</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Castle
 Green was once the site of an impressive fortification. Centuries ago, 
an invading army wrecked the castle, and the passing years have worn 
away nearly every stone, leaving only a great swath of flat, green 
sward. Only low, rounded mounds of turf show where the walls once lay. 
Uneven furrows in the grass follow the lines of the old moat.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 castle ruins could lie nearly anywhere, but a location within a day's 
march of a town is best. The ground level of any castle map could serve 
to depict the site. No walls still stand, but the foundations are still 
there, leaving a faint outline on the green.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 green can be just what it appears to be -- a pleasant open space with 
soft grass and cool breezes -- or it might prove a slightly more 
dramatic place than it appears at first glance.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Setup</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs might stumble on the site while traveling. They also might hear a 
few local tales about strange doings at the ruins, such as the 
following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ghostly
 watchmen patrol the castle walls during the dark of the moon. No one 
knows why the ghosts still walk. Some say they are guards doomed to 
atone for their failure to defend the castle. Others speak of ghostly 
revels that take place on the green in the midnight darkness while the 
watchmen stand guard and kill anyone who intrudes.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Invaders
 who overthrew the castle in ages past sowed the area with salt, so that
 naught grows on the green now except poisonous weeds. From time to 
time, foul beasts from beyond nature come to graze on the green, and it 
is death to behold them.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 hidden door somewhere in the ruins leads to a chamber full of treasure,
 but the treasure bears a deadly curse, and none who have so much as 
looked upon it have lived to tell the tale or spend so much as a copper 
of their ill-gotten lucre.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Faeries dance on the green during moonlit summer nights.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 up to you to decide which, if any, of these rumors are true (perhaps 
they all are). See the following sections for ways to use these rumors 
as adventure hooks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Exploring the Green</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Though
 mostly just flat, open space, the green has a few features worth 
investigating, as noted in the boxed text below, and in the sections 
that follow:</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Verdant
 grass covers this vast meadow. The land is fairly flat, except for some
 long, low mounds fronted by shallow ditches. A few brambles and low 
bushes grow in clumps here and there. A few sections of the area also 
seem strewn with ancient rubble.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Local
 rumors about the place being covered in poisonous weeds are false; the 
rumor started when someone noted that no trees grow on the site. Grazing
 animals and the occasional late summer wildfire keep the green open and
 grassy. In more civilized areas, shepherds might keep flocks of sheep 
and goats on the green.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Moat</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 castle's former moat is now just a shallow ditch of varying width and 
depth enclosing about a third of the site. Here and there, one can find 
remnants of stone retaining walls that once lined the moat's banks, and a
 few heavy stones from the castle walls lie embedded in the soft, 
slightly soggy moat bottom. There are several small ponds, fringed with 
cattails, where groundwater has seeped into the moat. These ponds teem 
with frogs, insects, and other small animals except in very cold or very
 dry weather.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 persistent search of the moat bottom (DC 25) reveals bits and pieces of
 humanoid skeletons (the remains of invaders or castle defenders), which
 are old and brittle, but not otherwise remarkable or dangerous.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 2, 3, 4, or 5): </b>Characters
 exploring the moat may also flush out one or two larger tenants: a cete
 of badgers or dire badgers, or even an ankheg.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Badgers (3):</b> hp 6 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ankheg (1 or 2):</b> hp 25 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Dire Badgers (4):</b> hp 25 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>The
 badgers or dire badgers don't try to make a meal of the PCs, but they 
resent intrusions and snarl at PCs from their burrows before coming out 
to attack; they charge if they can.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The ankhegs simply attack anything that comes within reach.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Walls</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 noted earlier, the castle's walls have been reduced to low mounds 
covered with turf. These mounds are about a foot high and about 20 feet 
thick. Digging into the side of a mound quickly uncovers massive blocks 
of fitted stone. These formed the base of the castle's outer walls. The 
original wall has inner and outer layers of stone filled with dirt 
rubble. In the years after the castle's fall, locals carted off most of 
the stone from the walls to use for their own buildings, dumping the 
rubble into the moat and filling it up. Digging into the top of a mound 
reveals a tightly packed mass of gravel, clay, and some larger rocks and
 stone chips.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 7 or 9):</b>
 Local tales of ghostly watchmen patrolling the walls in the dark of the
 night might be just tales, or they might be true. In the latter case, 
PCs who visit the green at night could encounter a pair of wraiths or 
spectres haunting the walls.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wraiths (2):</b> hp 32 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spectres (2):</b> hp 45 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Stone Circle and Sinkhole</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 area marks the site of the castle's main keep. The stone foundations 
are a little higher here (about 4 feet high), and some mossy stones 
stick up out of the turf. The keep walls are otherwise like the caster 
walls, except that they are solid stone all the way through and only 
about 10 feet thick.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 funnel-shaped depression nearly 40 feet deep fills the area inside the 
foundations. This was once part of the castle dungeons, but now it's 
just a hole in the ground, with grass-covered sides and a marshy area at
 the bottom. The sloping sides are steep, but not quite steep enough to 
require a Climb check when walking on them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Traps (EL 6): </b>A
 spring that once supplied the castle with water still flows, but it has
 become buried under several feet of dirt and debris over the centuries,
 making the bottom of the depression marshy. The marsh contains a deadly
 patch of quicksand.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Quicksand:</b> CR 6; no damage; Reflex DC 20 avoids; Search DC 25.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Notes:</b>
 A character who falls into quicksand can remain afloat with a Swim 
check (DC 15) but cannot escape the quicksand by swimming. Escape 
requires two consecutive Escape Artist or Strength checks (DC 20); each 
check requires a full-round action. Two consecutive failed checks mean 
the character sinks below the surface, where the character must hold his
 breath or begin drowning. A character below the surface must make two 
consecutive Escape Artist or Swim checks (DC 20) to regain the surface. 
Each round spent in quicksand after the first adds +1 to the DC of 
checks made to remain afloat, escape, or regain the surface. A character
 on solid ground can toss a rope to a companion stuck in quicksand and 
haul him out with a Strength check (DC 20). The quicksand is about 15 
feet deep.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 5, 6, or 7):</b>
 A swamp-loving creature might lurk in the marshy area and make 
occasional forays out onto the green to hunt or graze. It is these 
forays that give rise to local rumors about foul beasts from beyond 
nature grazing on the green.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Basilisk:</b> hp 45; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Death ray (Su):</b>
 A thin, green ray springs from the catoblepas' bloodshot eyes, causing 
any living creature it strikes to die. The ray can reach up to 160 ft. 
with no range increment. A creature that makes a successful Fortitude 
save (DC 18) is only partially affected. It takes 5d6 points of damage 
instead of dying. Only the first creature or object struck can be 
affected (that is, the ray affects only one target per use). Once the 
catoblepas uses this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it 
again. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Stun (Ex):</b>
 When a catoblepas strikes a living target with its tail, the target 
must make a Fortitude save (DC 18). If the target succeeds, it takes 
only the normal damage. If the target fails, it is stunned for 1 round 
in addition to taking damage normally. A stunned character can't act and
 loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Attackers get a +2 bonus on 
attack rolls against a stunned opponent. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Chuul: </b>hp 93; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Bramble Patch</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 pile of rubble overgrown with a thicket of thorny vines lies at one 
corner of the green. Every autumn, these vines are thick with 
blackberries.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 pile of rubble was once the castle's rear gate. It contained a secret 
door the defenders could use to make sallies against a besieging army. 
The door is still there, though it is hidden behind layers of moss and 
blackberry vines. To get at the door, one must first tear away the 
vines. If local tales are true, the door leads to a treasure chamber 
(see Secret Chamber); if not, the door merely opens onto a collapsed 
passageway.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Mass of Blackberry Vines:</b> 12 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 60; AC 5; break DC 28.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 3 or 6): </b>The
 vine-covered area would make an ideal lair for an assassin vine or 
shambling mound. The presence of either creature would be enough to 
scare commoners away from the area.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Assassin Vine:</b> hp 30; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Shambling Mound:</b> hp 60; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 Either creature hunts by ambushing visitors to the area. They usually 
wait until someone begins poking around the secret door or combing 
through the vines, then attack. The preferred target is a lone creature 
or someone separated from her companions by a few feet.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Secret Chamber</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 local tales of a hidden treasure under the green are true, the treasure
 chamber can be reached through the secret door in the bramble patch. 
The door opens onto a narrow passages and squirms its way deep under the
 green, finally ending in a large, dank chamber where the loot is stored
 in a few old, but very sturdy chests.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 5 or 7): </b>Local
 tales that speak of treasure here also speak of a curse. The "curse" 
has a fairly mundane basis -- unseen treasure guardians. A pair of 
phantom fungi, or perhaps an invisible stalker, might lurk in the 
chamber. The fungi are here naturally. The invisible stalker guards the 
chamber as part of an ancient bargain struck with the castle's original 
owners.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Phantom Fungi (2):</b> hp 15 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Invisible Stalker:</b> hp 52; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 The phantom fungi tend to attack by lurking near the chamber entrance 
and pouncing on the last character who enters. The invisible stalker 
uses similar tactics, but it singles out characters that seem to see it 
for special attention.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Treasure: </b>A
 level 5 to 7 treasure of triple size lies in the chamber. As noted 
above, the treasure is held in chests (at least three, but possibly more
 if appropriate).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Treasure Chests:</b> 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 20 each; AC 5; break DC 25; Open Lock DC 25.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Castle Courtyard</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 former castle courtyard looks just like the rest of the green, except 
that an old flagstone remains visible in the turf here and there.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 6 or 7): </b>Local
 tales say faeries dance on the green during moonlit summer nights. It 
may be just a bard's tale, or maybe not. If the latter, the moonlight 
revels consist of a nymph or dryad (from a nearby forest or copse), a 
grig fiddler, and a pair of pixies.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Dryad:</b> hp 7; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 These creatures are merely interested in dancing and having some fun.

 the characters protest that they can dance, the fey ask them to join in
 the fairy dance for the next set. Otherwise they merely allow them to 
watch. If the PCs do join the dance, the grig begins with a stately, 
formal tune meant for court dancing, then gradually speeds up the tempo 
to test the PCs' ability. By the time the dance is over, he is playing 
at a phenomenal rate that only a <i>hasted</i> character could keep up with. </span></p>

 try to back away and use their various magical powers. If hard pressed,
 the faeries might try to lead their opponents to the lair of another 
monster living on the green.</span></p>
