<p align="left">A grove of hoary old fruit trees encircles a dilapidated
 old manor house like a moth-eaten blanket. Holes in the house's roof 
and walls suggest that it has been abandoned for decades or longer. Yet,
 a curl of smoke from one intact chimney announces that someone is in 
residence. Squatters, perhaps?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The orchard sprawls over more than 200 acres. It is all 
that remains of the great estate belonging to the noble Montmorency 
family. The woods and fields around the orchard still belong to the 
family, but few people are left to work them. At one time, the orchard 
and fields were rich, but a prolonged drought followed by a war or other
 disaster drove off most of the common folk who worked the land. The 
family and a few stalwart retainers kept working the orchard, but they 
found themselves eating all of their produce (or giving it away to 
starving travelers) and the family was soon reduced to poverty.</p>
<p align="left">Over the years, the family has just barely held onto its
 property. A sprawling manor house stands amid the cherry, apple, and 
plum trees, but it has fallen into disrepair and only a single wing 
remains habitable.</p>
<p align="left">Today, only two Montmorency heirs remain. Tanya, an 
adopted daughter who was found abandoned on the manor's doorstep, works 
to revive the orchard and surrounding farmland. Leonor was born to the 
last count of Montmorency, Nikolos, and a local woman a few years after 
Tanya's adoption. The situation has left the title to the estate in 
doubt, because one heir is not a blood relative and the other is 
illegitimate. In fact, Nikolos left behind a will affirming that both 
women are his acknowledged heirs. The will makes Tanya sole owner of the
 estate until such a time as she judges Leonor responsible enough to 
claim her share. When Tanya thinks Leonor is ready, she is to get half 
the estate. Tanya knows about the will (but see the setup hook below for
 possible adjustments), but she has decided not to tell her sister about
 it. Tanya has no desire to cheat Leonor out of her due, but she's 
fairly certain her sister is not responsible enough to manage her 
inheritance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2005%20-%2010-04%20-%20The%20Orchard_files/dx0930vv_giantowl.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="280" width="193"></b>Unless the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">player characters</a>
 have a taste for fruit, they're not likely to visit the orchard unless 
they're lost or overly inquisitive. Here are a few things that might 
pique their interest.</p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs hear tales of a haunted orchard where flesh-eating spirits 
lurk and devour all who enter. A necromancer of great power and wealth 
dwells in a ruin at the center of the orchard, bending the spirits to 
her will and sending them forth to ravage the countryside.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> These tales are outlandish but have some basis in fact.
 The pixies and giant owls that dwell outside the orchard provide the 
basis for most of the tales -- many travelers and trespassers have 
endured some very bad frights in the area. The pixies' illusion powers 
are mostly to blame, but an attack from the giant owl on a dark night 
can be pretty scary when you don't know what you're facing. Leonor, too,
 has sometimes frightened or attacked people near the orchard, as the 
mood strikes her.</p>
<ul>
<li> A druid, merchant, or landowner hires the PCs to obtain a sapling 
(preferably several saplings) from a new variety of cherry that has come
 on the market recently. The person who has bred this new cherry is said
 to guard it jealously.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> Tanya has indeed created a new cherry variety (see 
Visiting the Orchard). Perhaps she would be willing to sell a few of her
 trees, or perhaps she does not wish to part with them, at the <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DungeonMaster')">DM's</a>
 option. Another option is that saplings aren't available yet. In this 
case, Tanya does her best to explain the situation to the PCs, but the 
DM could choose to have the PCs' employer be suspicious of her story so 
the truth won't make any difference.</p>
<ul>
<li> Leonor has somehow learned about her father's will and tries to 
hire the PCs to help her steal a copy that she believes is hidden in the
 house or orchard. Leonor doesn't know exactly what's in the will. She 
hopes that the will gives the whole estate to her, but she fears it has 
all gone to Tanya. She won't rest until she gets her hands on the will. 
The will might be hidden on the estate as Leonor suspects or it might be
 hidden elsewhere.<br><br></li>
<li> The PCs hear a rumor suggesting that the true Montmorency heir is 
neither Tanya nor Leonor. Or a person claiming to be the true 
Montmorency heir approaches the PCs and hires them to disprove Tanya's 
claim (or perhaps both Tanya's and Leonor's claims).</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The heir could be an imposter, but another heir who has 
been unjustly denied a share of the estate could also exist. Nikolos' 
will is genuine, however, and the best a third heir could do is claim an
 equal share from Tanya and Leonor. Tanya may retain her right to 
withhold the third share if the DM chooses. If so, the newly discovered 
heir is not likely to take that sitting down, and he or she might try to
 force Tanya's hand. The PCs will be faced with choosing sides (or 
perhaps simply withdrawing from the whole tangled affair).</p>
<p align="left"><b>About Tanya and Leonor</b></p>
<p align="left">Today, Tanya labors to rehabilitate the orchard and the 
rest of the estate. She and a few family retainers are carefully 
pruning, thinning, and replanting the orchard. She has found her 
considerable knowledge of agriculture and forestry unequal to the task 
and she has begun druidical studies. During the winter months, Tanya 
goes adventuring. She places the money she earns back into the estate.</p>
<p align="left">Meanwhile, Leonor has become an accomplished thief who 
uses the estate as a place to lie low when her exploits have gotten her 
into trouble. Leonor is happy to let her sister keep the estate running.
 She is unaware of the true extent of the property or exactly what it is
 worth. She assumes (correctly) that the family has accumulated 
considerable debt over the years and hopes to earn enough adventuring to
 save the place from inevitable foreclosure.</p>
<p align="left">In fact, Tanya is just barely staying ahead of the 
creditors, thanks to some careful negotiations and brilliant management 
of what assets she commands.</p>
<p align="left"> Tanya uses <i>entangle</i> or <i>soften earth and stone</i> to trap foes and make them more prone to see reason. If pressed, she uses <i>produce flame</i>
 to attack enemy spellcasters or heavily armored foes. She relies on 
Ebert to protect her. If a fight goes badly, she climbs aboard Ebert and
 tries to escape. (Ebert is not a riding horse, but he'll gladly carry 
Tanya out of danger.) If she has time, Tanya casts a <i>summon nature's ally</i>
 spell to help cover her retreat. If Leonor also in involved in the 
fight, Tanya won't withdraw unless she can persuade her sister to go, 
too.</p>

targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures 
without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from

<p align="left"><b>Manor House (EL 6-8)</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, this sprawling pile is mostly a ruin. 
Tanya and her "family" live in one wing on the ground floor. They have a
 kitchen, a living area, and a few chambers for storage and sleeping.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures:</b> Tanya has a handful of laborers and 
servants to help her with the orchard. Most of these people are very old
 or very young and none can help in a fight. Tanya herself can prove a 
formidable combatant, especially with Ebert at her side.</p>
<p align="left">Like any careful country farmer, Tanya keeps a few dogs 
for protection. These could be guard dogs or riding dogs, or both at the
 DM's option. From time to time, Leonor comes for a visit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dogs (6-9):</b> hp 6 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 271.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Riding Dogs (2-3):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 272.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The dogs attack as a pack. The whole 
group picks out a likely target and converges. When possible, some dogs 
slip to the flanks once battle is joined. The tactics Tanya and Leonor 
use are described earlier.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stables</b></p>
<p align="left">This building looks decrepit, but Tanya keeps it in good
 repair. Inside, Tanya stores the fruits of the orchard: some fresh, 
some dried. Tanya also has a few draft animals (including Ebert), a 
wagon for taking goods to market, and a few pigs and chickens.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inner Orchard and Gardens</b></p>
<p align="left">Tanya has brought most of the property within about 50 
yards of the house under proper cultivation. The area includes thriving 
fruit trees (including a variety of sour cherry that she has created 
herself through careful cross-pollination), vegetable gardens, and 
nursery plots where saplings grow.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Outer Orchard (EL 2-5)</b></p>
<p align="left">The orchard beyond the well-tended band around the house
 is tangled and overgrown from long neglect. Tanya has allowed several 
squatters to move in here. Possible residents include the following:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Black Bears (1-2):</b> hp 19 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 269.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> An abundance of wild and half-wild fruit has drawn these creatures. Tanya has conversed with them via <i>speak with animals </i>several
 times. The bears are grumpy toward most creatures other than Tanya 
herself, but they don't tend to attack unless surprised or harassed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Giant Owls (3-5):</b> hp 26 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 205.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> This company of giant owls lives and 
hunts among the taller trees in the woods on the estate. They're smart 
enough to distinguish casual visitors from raiders or attackers. They 
might attack creatures they regard as hostile, or they might simply send
 a messenger to warn Tanya of the intrusion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pixies (6-11):</b> hp 3 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 236.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The pixies frolic throughout the estate.
 They usually stick to the wilder areas, but they sometimes visit the 
house to play pranks on Tanya's servants or the receive treats of fruit 
and home cooking. They'll bedevil any intelligent creatures they meet. 
They usually refrain from lethal attacks, but quickly turn deadly if 
attacked with deadly force.</p>
