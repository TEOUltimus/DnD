<p align="left">In a world where most transportation is of the 
horse-drawn variety, businesses like Phindal's are part of the 
landscape. This particular livery stable, however, is a little different
 than most.</p>
<p align="left">The long, rambling stable has four wings radiating out 
from a central hub, which causes it to resemble a temple or some other 
public building rather than a mere horse barn. Stately trees shade the 
courtyard and stable. The building has a slate roof, bright red walls, 
and neat white trim.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">Phindal's Livery and Courier Service does exactly what 
its name suggests. Phindal boards horses and rents wagons and carriages.
 He also buys, sells, and trades horses, since many travelers find it 
convenient to ride hard and then trade mounts. This option allows them 
to travel onward without waiting for their mounts to rest. Besides 
horses, Phindal also handles other draft and riding animals, such as 
ponies, riding dogs, mules, and the like. As a sideline, the livery 
stable also provides a messenger service, that carries letters and small
 packages around town and to nearby cities.</p>
<p align="left">Phindal's is unusual for its sheer size and also for its proprietor -- Phindal is a centaur. </p>
<p align="left">Phindal's stables lie near a busy intersection, perhaps 
not far from the gates to a large city, or perhaps in a town or village 
located on a main road. The stables also could be within the boundaries 
of very big city, where they form part of a bucolic oasis amid the urban
 bustle.</p>
<p align="left">The stables are usually home to several dozen horses and
 other animals placed there by customers who pay for their care and 
feeding. Phindal has a kennel full of dogs to provide a little security 
and to keep the place free of rats. He also has at least a dozen draft 
animals of his own, which he uses to work fields he owns nearby. Phindal
 raises all the feed and bedding he uses in the stables himself.</p>
<p align="left">Phindal claims to be a widower, but rumors suggest that 
he is an outcast from his tribe who was expelled after offending the 
tribal leader. In any case, Phindal runs his business with assistance 
from his son and daughter, Lester and Lily, who are fraternal twins. 
Phindal has about a half dozen other centaurs in his employ, most of 
which are youngsters out to get a taste of the world and learn the ways 
of humans and other noncentaurs before returning to their tribes. 
Phindal acts as a sort of unofficial ambassador between the community 
where he does business and the centaur tribes living in the forests 
nearby. Some local wags maintain that Phindal's role as a go-between 
proves that the tales about his outcast status are just silly stories, 
but others just as enthusiastically maintain that his activities prove 
that he is a true outcast living between two cultures, but part of none.
 Phindal shrugs off the controversy and steadfastly maintains that he is
 just a widowed businessman.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">Characters who own mounts, as well as those who need to 
buy or rent them, might find themselves doing business at Phindal's from
 time to time. However, some incident or rumor also might draw them to 
the place, as noted below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A con artist (or pair of con artists) loiters in front of the 
stables without Phindal's knowledge. When potential customers approach 
the stables, one con artist walks out to meet them, then asks if he can 
"take" their horses. If the dupes agree, the con artist tells them they 
can "go around back to pay." When the victims are out of sight, the con 
artists trot off with the mounts.<br><br> The PC might fall victim to 
this ruse themselves (see Freely Given, below), or they might be hired, 
perhaps by Phindal himself, to track down the horse thieves.<br><br></li>
<li>A member of the nobility or other noteworthy citizen has vanished, 
and the only clue to the missing person's whereabouts is a diviner's 
assertion that the victim now wears another guise. This has lead to a 
thorough inspection of all farms and stables to determine if the 
vanished person has been transformed into an animal.<br><br> The PC 
might be asked to conduct the search, or they might be subjected to it. 
The missing person may even have been turned into a horse or other draft
 animal (most likely with a <i>polymorph any object</i> spell) and 
stashed away at Phindal's, or even among the party's draft animals. He 
or she could also have simply fled and planted this rumor to throw off 
any pursuit.<br><br></li>
<li>Riders from near and far are converging on the area for a great 
endurance race, and Phindal's has been selected to house the equine 
entrants until the big day.<br><br> The PCs might participate in the 
race, or Phindal might hire them to provide extra security. The race has
 a substantial prize, and many people have wagered on the outcome as 
well. Phindal or someone else may fear that unscrupulous folk might 
tamper with the horses, either by drugging them, or by performing a last
 minute switch -- perhaps substituting a look-alike nag for the favorite
 or an exceptional steed for a long-shot nag.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Stable</b></p>
<p align="left">The stable lies near a busy road or city street, and the
 PCs can get a good look as they approach. The text below is suitable 
for almost any locale or time of year. The gate stands open during 
daylight, but it is closed after dusk. The text assumes daylight. 
Characters easily can see through the gate or over the wall, however, so
 even a night viewing won't require much change.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">A bright red stable with neat, white trim stands at the 
roadside. A low, stone wall forms a courtyard around the building. An 
iron gate stands open, showing a spotless, cobblestone-paved courtyard 
shaded by ancient trees.</p>
<p align="left">The building itself features a pentagonal central hub 
with wings radiating from four sides. The remaining side has a pair of 
doors that are tall and wide enough to admit a coach. A smaller portal 
(about human-sized) is set into one side of these doors. Long rows of 
similar doors line the wings. The doors along the wings have no doors 
cut into them, but the upper and lower halves are hinged separately. No 
other portals or entrances are visible except for a row of windows and 
hatches located just below the eaves, perhaps a dozen feet off the 
ground.</p>
<p align="left">A watering trough and hitching rail wide enough for at 
least a dozen horses stand in front of the central portal. A brass bell 
with a trailing pull rope stands on a pole next to the trough.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The large doors in the central hub are for the staff; 
the smaller door has been placed there for the customers' use. The split
 doors along the wings allow the top halves to be opened for light and 
ventilation in warm weather, while keeping the barn animals shut in. The
 windows and hatches above serve much the same purpose.</p>
<p align="left">The usual order of business at Phindal's has the 
customer bringing a mount or vehicle to the hitching rail and ringing 
the bell for service. Regulars often don't even bother to wait until a 
staff member comes to take charge of the mount or vehicle; they just tie
 the animal to the rail and leave.</p>
<p align="left">The courtyard usually stands empty unless the staff is 
busy cleaning leaves and droppings off the cobblestones (a task 
performed whenever an animal leaves or enters the place), or when it is 
time to clean the stalls, exercise the animals, or move supplies. In the
 spring and fall, the courtyard sees considerable activity, but during 
the winter and summer it can stand empty for hours.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inside</b></p>
<p align="left">The central hub is more than 50 feet wide and contains 
an office, a waiting area for customers, and quarters for Phindal, his 
family, and his staff. The waiting area has doors that lead to each of 
the stable's four wings.</p>
<p align="left">Each wing consists of a long row of box stalls on the 
side closest to the road and a storage area for grain, hay, and vehicles
 on the other side. An aisle about 15 feet wide separates the stalls 
from the storage areas. The stalls have exits leading directly outside 
and additional exits that open onto the aisle. In addition, a door at 
about every 30 feet leads outside from the storage area.</p>
<p align="left">The stable is of half-timber construction, with stone 
laid between massive wooden beams. The stone is painted red, and the 
beams are white. The roof is black slate. All the doors are wooden.</p>
<p align="left">The courtyard has two additional gates: one behind the stable and one side gate near the end of one of the wings.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Behind the Stable</b></p>
<p align="left">A small complex of stone outbuildings lies behind the 
stable: There is a smithy, a well house, a kennel, and additional 
storage for grain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 9-10)</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, Phindal has a staff of centaurs to 
help him run the place, along with his two children and many dogs. The 
entire staff is almost never present at one time, except at night when 
most of them are asleep. Lester and Lilly, Phindal's children, usually 
are away most of the day, serving as couriers and running errands for 
Phindal. This usually leaves Phindal to work the stable with just a few 
centaurs to see to the animals. The rest of the staff is either off duty
 (and away from the site) or busy in Phindal's fields, which are some 
distance away.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, however, business takes Phindal away from the
 stable, and in that case one or both of his children stand in for him. 
No matter who is on duty, a few dogs mill around as well.</p>
<p align="left">Here are stats for Phindal at two different levels.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion (Ex):</b> The companion's abilities

link and share spells special qualities. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Link (Ex):</i> Phindal can handle Fang as a free 
action. He also gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks
 and Handle Animal checks made regarding Fang. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i> Phindal may have any spell he 
casts on himself also affect his animal companion if the latter is 
within 5 feet at the time. Phindal may also cast a spell with a target 
of "You" on Fang.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b>Favored Enemy (Ex):</b> Phindal gains a +2 bonus on 
his Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using 
these skills against giants. He gains the same bonus on weapon damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trackless Step (Ex):</b> Phindal leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Phindal may move through 
natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his 
normal speed and without damage or other impairment. However, thorns, 
briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede 
motion still affect him.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Druid Spells Prepared</i> (caster level 3rd): 0 -- <i>cure minor wounds, guidance, mending, resistance;</i> 1st -- <i>cure light wounds, magic fang, speak with animals;</i> 2nd -- <i>barkskin, summon swarm.</i></p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Phindal would rather negotiate than 
fight, but he doesn't take well to threats or abuse. In battle, Phindal 
usually calls his dogs to keep the foe busy while he hangs back and uses
 his bow. The stable and surrounding courtyard offer plenty of space for
 Phindal to make ranged attacks, and he usually can use his speed to 
stay out of melee. If cornered, Phindal can deal considerable damage 
with his greatsword. (He's not afraid of melee combat, but he's acutely 
aware of his lack of Armor Class compared with his offensive 
capabilities.) If he thinks his opponents might be getting tired of the 
fight, he may try to grapple the most belligerent among them just to 
take that foe out of the battle while he tries to reopen negotiations.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Phindal and the Adventure Hooks</b>: If the PCs 
should come to the stables looking for a polymorphed person, Phindal is 
willing to let them look over his stock (and the animals left in his 
charge). Phindal is as surprised as anyone if there turns out to be a 
polymorphed person in his care.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs are involved in the big race somehow, they 
find that Phindal is as nervous as a cat and very worried about 
security. He takes a dim view of any attempts to tamper with the horses 
in his care.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs should lose their mounts outside Phindal's business, the centaur is outraged; see Freely Given, below.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Lester and Lily like to press the 
attack. They're capable archers, but they prefer to move in for melee 
attacks. They can call the stable dogs for help, and they do so at the 
first opportunity. They're aware of their superior speed, and once the 
dogs get into the fray, Lester and Lily break off to fire a few arrows, 
then close in again, usually in flanking positions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Centaur Stablehands (2-8): </b>hp 26 each, see <i>Monster Manual, </i>page 32.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Riding Dogs</b><b>(4-12):</b> hp 13 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 272.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>The stablehands and dogs take their lead
 from the person in charge of the stable at the time. Usually, a pair of
 dogs stays near the office, and they attack the nearest foe when a 
fight breaks out. If the centaur in charge calls for help, at least two 
more dogs join the fight after 1 or 2 rounds. At least two stablehands 
join in 1 or 2 rounds after that. The dogs simply attack the closest 
foes, but the centaurs try to match their leaders' tactics.</p>

<p align="left">As noted in the Setup section, the PCs might encounter a
 con artist or two. If they don't pay attention, they could lose their 
mounts.</p>
<p align="left">Brock, a halfling rogue, is the lead con artist. The 
halfling disguises himself as a human boy who runs to meet the PCs as 
they enter the courtyard. </p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Mornin', good folk," says a cheerful-looking, towheaded
 boy. "Welcome to Phindal's, the best livery stable in the county. Can I
 take your horses?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the PCs agree, Brock gathers up the mounts' reins and
 leads them to the far end of the barn. He listens carefully to any 
instructions they give regarding the animals' care, but makes no 
specific promises, saying only "We aim to please."</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"You can go on around the back to pay," calls the boy 
over his shoulder as he leads the mounts around the side of the barn. 
"The boss is back there taking care of a horse that threw a shoe."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The moment he's out of sight, Brock climbs aboard a mount and leads the string of animals out the side gate.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs walk around the back, they're confronted by a
 quartet of wildly barking dogs. Eventually, the PCs meet a mildly 
annoyed staff member who wonders what they are doing poking around the 
back lot.</p>
<p align="left">The stable has no human staff members, so the centaurs 
are pretty quick to realize that the PCs have been had, but they become 
irritated if they're accused of complicity in the theft. Phindal might 
offer to take a dog or two and attempt to track the thief, but he won't 
agree to pay for the PCs' loss.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 4-9):</b> Brock may work alone or in 
league with Runnild, a dwarf cleric of Olidammara. Here are stats for 
Brock and Runnild at two different levels.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Brock:</b> Male halfling rogue 4; CR 4; Small 
humanoid; HD 4d6; hp 14; Init +8; Spd 20 ft.; AC 20, touch 16, 
flat-footed 20; Base Atk +3; Grp -2; Atk or Full Atk +4 melee 
(1d6-1/19-20, masterwork short sword) or +6 ranged (1d6-1, sling with

+8, Sleight of Hand +13, Tumble +11; Dodge, Improved Initiative.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sneak Attack (Ex): </b>Brock deals 2d6 extra points 
of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked 
targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus 
for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against 
targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures 
without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from
 critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Brock may choose to 
deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a 
weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If Brock is exposed to any effect 
that normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trapfinding (Ex):</b> Brock can find, disarm, or 
bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to 
find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the 
level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result 
exceeds the trap's DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap
 without triggering or disarming it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Brock retains his Dexterity 
bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe 
(he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>Brock has been working his away across 
the country, conning people out of their mounts outside inns and livery 
stables, mostly for his own amusement, but also for the money. If found 
out, he is likely to spar with the party for a while; he uses his Tumble
 skill to move around and attack in unexpected places. If he has Runnild
 to help him, he looks for chances to get into flanking positions so he 
can make sneak attacks (though he might manage some on his own by 
feinting in combat).</p>
<p align="left">If Runnild is present, she initially poses as a fellow 
traveler. She gladly hands over her mount (a stolen light warhorse) and 
wanders toward the back of the stable, where she casts an <i>invisibility</i> spell, then rejoins Brock.</p>
<p align="left">In a fight, Runnild does her best help Brock set up sneak attacks. She uses her <i>command</i> spells to discomfort the party. She uses <i>silence</i> to break up enemy spellcasting, and <i>hold person</i> against the most physically imposing PC.</p>
<p align="left">If the characters catch up with Brock and Runnild after 
their horses have been stolen, the two protest their innocence to any 
and all who happen to be nearby. Since they frequent towns and cities 
more than the wilderness, any confrontation is likely to occur in front 
of dozens of witnesses.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"These fine folks gave us these horses of their own free
 will," insists the boy loudly. "I asked for them straight up, no 
fooling, and they said I could take 'em. Those were the exact words, I 
swear! Now they come after me claimin' we cheated 'em. They're probably 
members of some rustling ring, giving horses away for free just to seed 
herds so they can claim the whole lot later on. Either that or they're 
plain stupid."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Most listeners are inclined to agree with the latter 
sentiment and let the PCs bear the results of their own lack of 
judgment. Should the characters become violent, Brock calls for the 
constabulary and tries to have them arrested. If possible, he slips away
 before any trial; otherwise, he sticks to his story that the horses 
were freely given to him. </p>
<p align="left">Whatever the results of the PCs' efforts to reclaim 
their mounts, Phindal posts a picture of Brock drawn from the PCs' 
descriptions with a "horse thief" caption to warn future patrons of the 
halfling's duplicity.</p>
