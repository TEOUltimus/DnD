<p align="left">The old farmhouse looks abandoned, but a hard-working 
couple lives there. Is the house and its residents what it seems, or is 
it something more?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The farm lies about a half-day's ride from a town 
(population 1,000 to 5,000). The area has seen better days. Perhaps a 
war or other disaster has depopulated the countryside, or perhaps a 
local industry has collapsed -- mines might have played out, or trade 
routes could have shifted. There might be a hamlet or thorp fairly close
 to the farm, but overall the land is fairly empty. Abandoned farms dot 
the area. Most feature tumbledown buildings (usually just a house or a 
hut and perhaps a small barn or shed), crumbling stone walls, and 
overgrown fields. </p>
<p align="left">A handful of folks with a pioneering spirit have moved 
into the area recently and taken over the deserted farms. For the past 
couple of years, they have been slowly putting the abandoned fields back
 into production. It's a hard task. The hills and dells in the vicinity 
are home to all manner of dangerous creatures, including goblins, 
wolves, lycanthropes, undead, ankhegs, and displacer beasts. There are 
even rumors of a dragon in the neighborhood. </p>
<p align="left">Among the recent arrivals are Jerald and Ouida, a pair 
of semi-retired adventurers who have opted for the simple country life. 
The couple has laid claim to a farm with a two-story house, a barn, a 
weed-choked pond, and many acres of hilly, rocky land covered with 
spindly trees. The house and barn have the requisite deteriorated stone 
walls. The place still looks abandoned. Jerald and Ouida have patched 
the roof and repaired a few shutters, but they haven't made too many 
cosmetic repairs. A few chickens and pigs root around in the weed-strewn
 barnyard, and several cats peer out from gaps in the barn walls. A 
passer-by might smell woodsmoke from the kitchen fire on days when the 
wind is right. A close look reveals vegetable gardens and a few rows of 
grain growing among the native grasses.</p>
<p align="left">Jerald is a druid, and he is determined to run his farm 
according to nature's scheme. He has planted wild grapes and berries 
along the farm's crumbling stone walls and around the edges of the 
fields and pastures. He grows some grain, but he mixes it in with native
 grasses. In addition to his chickens and pigs, Jerald also keeps many 
hives of bees, including a few giant bees. </p>
<p align="left">Jerald and Ouida grow their own food. They also make 
wine and mead for sale in town. Ouida has woven some good linen cloth 
from the flax Jerald grows, and Jerald also makes himself useful to his 
neighbors, sharing his healing magic and skill and offering advice on 
farming in nature's image. His ability to heal sick or injured animals 
and people is undeniable, so the neighbors are beginning to listen to 
Jerald's unorthodox ideas. Jerald doesn't charge anything for his 
services, but he and Ouida receive a steady supply of gifts (usually in 
the form of food) from grateful neighbors. </p>
<p align="left">Ouida (pronounced WEE da) is a child of the aristocracy 
who fled the intrigues of family and court for the adventuring life. 
Before long, she found the hardships and dangers of adventuring just as 
irksome as life at court had been, and she resolved to spend some time 
building something of real value. She's not entirely sure she approves 
of Jerald's methods, but she is convinced that the couple will someday 
own a large and productive farm and that their success will attract 
other settlers to reclaim all the land in the region.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs might find the farm while traveling 
cross-country -- perhaps when they try to take a shortcut and get lost. 
The PCs also might come looking for the farm after hearing a rumor about
 the area. They might hear any of the following tales in the neighboring
 towns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your wits about you when you go into the hills. The settlers up
 there are friendly enough, and they are always hungry for news from the
 wide world. Some settlers, though, aren't what they seem. There's 
plenty of bandits that are just squatting in the old abandoned farms, 
and some of them are shapeshifters. There's a whole herd of 
skin-changing swine up in those hills, and they'd just as soon kill you 
as look at you.<br><br> This warning is partly true; there are wereboars
 in the area. Some of the locals, however, think Jerald and Ouida are 
wereboars. Jerald can, in fact, turn into a boar with wild shape, and 
his boar companion, Rowaan, is no ordinary swine thanks to his link with
 Jerald.<br><br></li>
<li> Not so long ago, this whole area was rich farmland, and many yeoman
 farmers made tidy sums selling their crops and beasts. There was gold 
in the hills, too, and lots of folks who owned their own land became 
even richer. Some of the old farms around here have caches of treasure 
buried under the houses or barns. Lots of the so-called settlers are 
really just treasure hunters who dig around their land while pretending 
to farm. There's one weird couple that tends giant bees and keeps some 
swine up on a hillside, but they haven't done a lick of work on their 
property or planted any crops. They have money all right. Folks say 
there's plenty more up around their farm, all free for the taking if you
 can get off the hill while those two aren't watching.<br><br> The 
unusual prosperity Jerald and Ouida enjoy, coupled with their farm's 
run-down appearance, gave rise to this rumor. The couple's neighbors 
scoff at any suggestion that Jerald and Ouida work for their living, 
though they confess that they're a pair of odd ducks full of strange 
ideas and refined book learning.<br><br> It's also possible that the 
rumor contains a hint of truth. There might be ancient treasures buried 
in the hills, though perhaps not right on Jerald's and Ouida's hillside 
farm.<br><br></li>
<li> The overgrown fields and thickets up in the hills hide all manner 
of ancient things. Some of these ancient things lie quietly, and some 
are restless, especially after sundown. Many crypts and small graveyards
 dot the slopes, all obscured now by mats of creeping vines and stands 
of sickly trees. The graves and crypts once belonged to prosperous 
families who owned land in the area; now they're dens full of the 
unquiet dead.<br><br> The countryside around the farm indeed features 
dozens of crypts and graveyards where the former residents buried their 
dead. Tales of undead haunting these places might be true, or they might
 simply be local legends. If true, the hills and byways around the farm 
could be extra hazardous at night.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Farm</b></p>
<p align="left">The following is appropriate for a visit to the farm on a spring or summer day, or a day in early autumn.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">The dirt road winds through rolling, wooded hills, 
seemingly leading upward much more than down. In a hollow on the flanks 
of the hill ahead stands a tumbledown house, two stories high, with 
ivy-covered stone walls and a roof of mossy slates. Peeling green 
shutters flank the windows. A veritable thicket of bushes and tall grass
 surrounds the house, and a crumbling stone wall encloses it all. A 
small barn with wattle and daub walls and a rotting thatch roof stands 
near the house. Fairly open fields with tall grass, clover, wildflowers,
 and a few bands of wheat surround the whole place, with trees beyond 
that. Sweet perfume fills the air, along with a sepulchral thrum that 
rises and falls. A squadron of bees the size of ponies seems to patrol 
the place. Also, a mixed group of poultry (ducks, geese, and a few 
chickens) and swine nose through the thicket around the house. It's hard
 to tell exactly how many animals there are.</p>
</td>

<p align="left">It's nearly impossible to approach the house without alerting the animals, who can both see and smell the PCs approaching.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 8):</b> Jerald and Ouida keep a herd of
 swine (fourteen sows and piglets, three boars), a collection of poultry
 (four geese, eighteen ducks, and nine chickens), and eight cats. In 
addition, the Jerald has Rowaan, his boar animal companion, and Ouida 
has Yasmine, her cat familiar. A celestial horse named Malachy also 
shares the farm at the moment. Malachy came to the Material Plane some 
time ago in the company of a few angels and decided to stay awhile. The 
stallion enjoys the farm's semi-wild beauty and makes himself useful 
helping Jerald and Ouida keep less friendly visitors at bay.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion:</b> Jerald has a boar named Rowaan as his animal companion. He gains the following benefits from it. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Link (Ex):</i> Jerald can handle Rowaan as a free 
action or push him as a move action. He gains a +4 bonus on all wild 
empathy checks and Handle Animal checks regarding him. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex):</i> Jerald may have any spell he 
casts upon himself also affect Rowaan if desired. Rowaan must be within 5
 feet of him at the time of casting to receive this benefit. If the 
spell has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting Rowaan
 if he moves more than 5 feet away and does not affect him again even if
 he returns before the duration expires. Jerald may also cast a spell 
with a target of "You" on Rowaan (as a touch range spell) instead of on 
himself. Jerald and Rowaan can even share spells that do not normally 
affect creatures of the animal type.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b> Jerald gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks (included in the numbers given above).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trackless Step (Ex):</b> Jerald leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wild Shape (Su):</b> Once per day, Jerald can assume the form of any animal of Small or Medium size. This ability functions like the <i>polymorph</i>
 spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 5 hours, or until 
Jerald changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard 
action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen 
must be that of an animal Jerald is familiar with. Jerald loses his 
ability to speak while in animal form because he is limited to the 
sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but he can communicate 
normally with other animals of the same general grouping as his new 
form. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Jerald may move through 
natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his 
normal speed and without suffering damage or other impairment. However, 
thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to 
impede motion still affect him.</p>

 affect Rowaan if the latter is within 5 feet for the whole duration of 
the spell. Additionally, Jerald may cast a spell with a target of "You"

 where the farm stands, and a group of armed and armored player 
characters makes quite a splash. Jerald and Ouida aren't particularly 
aggressive or resentful of trespassers, but they pay attention to what's
 going on in their vicinity and they make a point of greeting all 
passersby, more or less as follows.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">A middle-aged man and woman emerge from the barn. 
"Welcome, strangers," says the man, proffering the hand that isn't 
holding a pitchfork. "My name's Jerald, and this here's my wife Ouida."</p>
<p align="left">"Not often we have visitors in these parts," says Ouida,
 offering a hand in greeting while clutching a fold of her brown skirt 
with the other to keep the eggs it contains from falling out. Gets right
 lonely sometimes. Would you all like to come in for some tea? Won't 
take but a minute."</p>
<p align="left">"Watch out for the bees now," says Jerald. "They're a 
mite sensitive about any place where they got a nest -- which is just 
about everyplace."</p>
<p align="left">"Shoulda seen him when we first moved in," chuckles 
Ouida. "Stumbled into a nest and by the time they were done with him, he
 was swelled up like a balloon."</p>
<p align="left">If the characters accept the invitation, the two lead 
them into a huge farm kitchen and offer them seats at an old oak table 
that looks as if it has seen better days. Tea is offered as soon as 
Ouida can get the kettle heated, and she also puts out a loaf of 
homemade bread, several containers of homemade jam, a large honeycomb, 
and a platter of shredded, cooked pork.</p>
<p align="left">Whether the PCs are inside or outside, the couple tries 
to get them to talk further. "You folks passing through on your way 
someplace?" asks Jerald. "We don't get out much anymore. Too busy taking
 care of this place and helping out the neighbors. I tell you, the land 
can support you right well if you take care of it right. You can't just 
plant the same thing in the same spot every year -- you'll get bugs and 
wear out the land. That's probably why folks abandoned this land before,
 'cause they were so dead set on raising big crops of the same stuff all
 the time that they wore it out. That's not nature's way. Nature likes 
variety."</p>
<p align="left">"Oh look, there goes Felton," says Ouida, as a cart 
drawn by a single horse rattles by. Ouida and Jerald wave to the driver,
 who waves back. "Wonder where he's going this time of day?"</p>
<p align="left">"Probably just wanted to get a look at the newcomers," 
says Jerald with a smile. "Like I said, we don't get many visitors 
hereabouts. Probably thinks you're gonna dig up his fields looking for 
treasure. Lost his whole crop last year to treasure hunters. And all 
they found was an old plow, a ring of rusty keys, and an iron bathtub. 
Some others tried it this spring, but Felton set his goat on 'em. They 
lit outta here like they was being chased by the hounds of hell, 
shouting about demons. It was dark and all, and I guess Felton's goat 
can look pretty scary at night. But I sure hope you all aren't here to 
bother honest folk."</p>

<p align="left">If a fight breaks out, Malachy and Rowaan are quick to 
join the fray, even without being asked. Jerald stands his ground and 
casts <i>entangle</i> defensively. He relies on Malachy and Rowaan to protect him. Ouida drops back to cast <i>shield.</i> Once that's done, Ouida uses <i>scorching ray </i>or <i>Melf's acid arrow </i>on the foe. Jerald uses <i>call lightning</i> early in the fight, and then uses <i>chill metal.</i> If the spell assault doesn't seem to work well, Ouida casts <i>blur,</i> then tries to maneuver to make a few sneak attacks. Jerald may try <i>flame blade</i>, or he may assume boar form and attempt a few gore attacks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Further Adventures</b></p>
<p align="left">Assuming a fight doesn't break out, Jerald and Ouida are happy to show the PCs around the place.</p>
<p align="left">The house has three rooms on the ground floor: the 
kitchen, a sitting room with a few sticks of old furniture, and a pantry
 stuffed with plain food. The upper floor has a big bedchamber with a 
comfortable, but worn bed.</p>
<p align="left">The house is built on a steep slope, and it has a 
ground-level exit. The cellar has two chambers: a root cellar and an old
 box stall that now serves as a storage area for whole grain and a hand 
mill for making flour. Several cats occupy the stall.</p>
<p align="left">The barn, like the house, sits on a slope and has a 
cellar with a ground-level exit. The upper level holds hay and a 
dilapidated wagon that the former owners left behind. The lower level 
has a box stall where Malachy lives and storage for fodder and grain. 
Numerous cats prowl in and around the barn.</p>
<p align="left">To date, Jerald and Ouida haven't found any buried 
treasure, discovered any dens of undead, or had any raids by marauding 
lycanthropes. On the other hand, the couple has never gone looking for 
such things. They're happy to allow the PCs a chance to poke around the 
property a little bit. They insist on a small share (10-20%) of anything
 the PCs discover.</p>
<p align="left">The sprawling farm has several hundred acres of wooded 
hills interspersed with meadows where fields and pastures once stood. 
The property includes a small graveyard with two crypts. This burial 
ground is long abandoned and completely invisible under at least a 
century's worth of trees and weeds. The place might just have a few 
resident undead (who've been lying quiet until the PCs come along).</p>
<p align="left">The property also has a few dry caves, one of which 
might just hold a cache of treasure. (Perhaps the ghost of the bandit 
that hid the treasure guards it, or perhaps some wandering creature has 
laid claim to it.)</p>
<p align="left">Careless PCs might fall afoul of the farm's giant bees 
(much to Jerald and Ouida's chagrin). The PCs might also discover a 
monster or two that is new to the neighborhood.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Farm as a Darker Place</b></p>
<p align="left">Perhaps the rumors about lycanthropes in the hills are 
really true. Jerald and Ouida might be a pair of wereboars posing as 
eccentric farmers. In such a case, Malachy might be a fiendish horse.</p>
