<p align="LEFT"> Most roads serve the practical function of getting 
travelers from one place to another. This one, however, seems to lead 
nowhere -- it's just a stretch of smooth, hard pavement that winds 
through the countryside. It starts in a marsh and ends in a rocky 
hillside (or perhaps it's the other way around). Tumbledown ruins, most 
no larger than a peasant hut, lie at the intervals along the way.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This particular road was once part of a complex network 
used for mass processions. Priests once collected the faithful, who then
 walked along en masse as part of an annual religious festival. The 
heaps of ruins along the road were once roadside shrines and pilgrims' 
hostels. The deity for whom the processions were organized might be long
 forgotten now, though a long-vanished cult of a current deity (from the
 <b>D&amp;D</b> pantheon or whatever pantheon you use in your campaign) 
might actually have organized the processions. Fharlanghn, the deity of 
travel and roads, is an obvious choice, but a nature deity such as 
Obad-Hai would also be appropriate. An athletic deity such as Kord could
 be a good choice as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The road owes its current good condition to Yurlada and 
her band of derro companions. The group stumbled across the road a few 
years ago and quickly grasped its former religious significance. They 
promptly took it upon themselves to restore the pavement, though their 
motives at the time weren't clear even to them -- the urge to repair the
 road was merely an outgrowth of derro racial insanity. After they had 
completed a stretch of road several miles long, their bloodthirsty 
natures asserted themselves and the group began planting traps along the
 road. Today, the road looks smooth and safe, but it marks a deadly 
route.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The road can wind through any kind of terrain, but it should exist in a remote area. Since the road doesn't really go anywhere, <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_playercharacter')">PCs</a>
 aren't too likely to stumble across it by accident, but they could 
stumble on it while moving cross-country. More likely, the PCs find the 
road while investigating a rumor, such as those below.</p>
<ul>
<li> The road forms a series of figures that are clearly visible only 
from the air. Local legends claim that the figures writhe and move at 
certain times of the year, but only at night. In the morning, they 
reveal some secret hidden in the clouds above or in the earth below.<br><br>
 These tales have some basis in fact. The figures' apparent shifting, 
however, is strictly due to the derro's efforts to clear and maintain 
the road.<br><br></li>
<li> According to some tales, not all the ruins along the road are 
empty. A few contain hidden vaults crammed with offerings of jewels and 
precious metals left by generations of pilgrims. These treasures have 
remained unlooted for various reasons, including ever-vigilant divine 
guardians, complex locks, and deadly traps. A lively trade in treasure 
maps, keys, and clues purporting to unlock the secrets thrives at 
several sites along the road.<br><br> DMs can choose to hide some 
ancient treasures along the road. The maps and clues offered for sale, 
however, almost certainly are fakes.<br><br></li>
<li> The ghosts of ancient pilgrims (or sacrificial victims) still 
wander the road at night, and occasionally on stormy days. More ghosts 
dwell in the ruined buildings by the roadside. Most of these spirits 
have a thirst for living blood.<br><br> No ghosts haunt this road, but 
tales of spirits in the area might be based on encounters with Yurlada 
and her cronies, whose skill at stealth makes them seem ghostly indeed.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Exploring the Road (EL 7-10)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A trip along the road eventually produces an encounter with the derro's traps. Yurlada and her cronies lurk near their traps.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Traps: </b>Like most derro, Yurlada and her group prefer traps that secure victims for capture. Below are a few examples of their work.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Camouflaged Pit Trap: </b>CR 6; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; multiple traps (pit and entrapment at the bottom); <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 20 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Reflexsave')">Reflex save</a> avoids; 40 ft. deep (3d6 + 1d6 nonlethal, fall); multiple targets (first target in each of two adjacent 5-ft. squares); <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_skillcheck')">Search</a> DC 25; Disable Device DC 17. <i>Market Price: </i>8,300 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The 5 feet of soft clay that the derro have added to the
 bottom of the pit makes this trap effectively two CR 4 traps. The clay 
accounts for the nonlethal damage from the fall (see page 303 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Creatures that fall into the pit become stuck in the 
clay -- and possibly mired and immobilized. Anyone who falls into the 
pit must attempt a DC 16 Reflex save. Success means the character can 
struggle free as a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_fullroundaction')">full-round action</a> and is considered <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_entangled')">entangled</a> until he leaves the clay. Failure means the character is trapped in the clay, immobile and <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_helpless')">helpless</a>, until he makes a DC 20 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> check to wrench himself free.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Netcaster Traps: </b>CR 2 each; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_attack')">Atk</a> +6 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_rangedtouchattack')">ranged touch</a> (entanglement, net); Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price: </i>2,000 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">These traps hurl nets up to 10 feet as a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Medium')">Medium</a> attacker with a Strength score of 18. Yurlada and her derro have placed them in groups of four to six.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures: </b>The derro usually hide in ruins or 
undergrowth near the road. They always make sure they have protection 
from the sun during the day. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Occasionally, Yurlada serves as bait for a trap, sitting
 by the side of the road or up in a tree singing a nonsense tune. She 
renders the lyrics in a sort of singsong manner similar to that of a 
child's rhyme, and indeed this song was built from several of those. 
However, she supplements the tune with hauntingly beautiful 
accompaniment on her instrument.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">From somewhere ahead, the strains of a tune drift downward from above.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Ring around the mulberry tree,<br> A pocket full of posy,<br> Mary lost her little lambs three,<br> But her tuffet's very cozy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The weasel hunts the dire bear now,<br> The lion flees the mousies,<br> The dogs hide in the barn with the cow,<br> And the cats live in their housies."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Yurlada's ditty is best sung to the tune of "Pop Goes 
the Weasel." The rest of her band hides nearby. Should the PCs stop to 
talk with Yurlada, she asks them to clap if they like her tune. Those 
who wish to comply must put down or sheathe their weapons to do so. 
Thus, they do not have weapons in hand when she signals her band to 
attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Statistics for several different examples of derro are 
provided below; feel free to mix and match them as you like. Two 
versions of the leader, Yurlada, are included. A fairly weak derro group
 might consist of Yurlada (1st-level bard), Urbak, and two derro, plus 
four netcaster traps. A more powerful group would contain Yurlada 
(3rd-level bard), Urbak, four derro thugs, and a pit trap.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> As noted earlier, the derro tend to lie 
in wait near a trap (or group of traps), using their Hide skills to wait
 in ambush. They usually wait until potential victims fall afoul of 
their traps, but they might attack and drive their foes into a trap if 
necessary. For their initial attack, the derro fire poisoned bolts (if 
available) from their repeating crossbows. If they catch the enemy 
flat-footed, these attacks are sneak attacks if the derro are within 30 
feet. After the initial volley of arrows, most of the derro use their <i>daze</i> abilities and Yurlada uses bardic music (usually inspire competence) for a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_round')">round</a> or two. After expending their <i>daze</i> attacks, all the derro except Yurlada try to knock out foes who aren't dazed, either with more poisoned bolts or with <i>sound burst </i>effects.
 After that, the derro keep up their ranged attacks until the foe is 
defeated or moves in for melee attacks. The derro then switch to melee 
weapons; when possible, they bring their sneak attacks into play by 
flanking foes. Meanwhile, Yurlada switches to spells or her wand, 
hitting the most troublesome characters with <i>blindness/deafness</i> (blindness effect), <i>flare</i>, or <i>grease</i>. The derro fight to the death or until Yurlada falls. When the bard is defeated, the surviving derro use their <i>darkness</i> abilities to confuse foes. They keep attacking for a round or two, but withdraw if the foe keeps up the fight.</p>
