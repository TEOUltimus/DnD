<p align="left">The high vale offers pleasant views of heather waving in
 the breeze, slopes draped in gauzy mists, and quaint peasant huts. What
 sort of danger could possibly lurk behind this charming scene?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The misty vale can lie within an area of rugged hills or
 low mountains. It's a wild and lonely place, but not too far from 
civilization. Shepherds use the vale for summer pasture, and the gentry 
from the lowlands nearby hunt in the wooded slopes above the valley 
floor. The valley is neither straight nor level, and one seldom can see 
any appreciable distance, even during a rare spell of clear weather. The
 ever-present veil of mist and fog is a natural phenomenon, due, 
perhaps, to warm winds blowing inland from the sea to mix with cooler 
mountain air. Or perhaps the valley and the heights surrounding it act 
as a natural channel that bring together gentle zephyrs from the south 
with colder, hasher northern breezes.</p>
<p align="left">The vale has a few permanent residents, mostly hunters 
and woodcutters, plus a tribe of centaurs. Spring brings shepherds with 
their flocks, and they in turn attract the attention of some less savory
 visitors, including packs of dire wolves and a few ogres, all looking 
for easy pickings.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs might simply pass through the vale on their way 
to somewhere else, or they might be drawn to the place for one of the 
following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>A druid or member of the nobility might hire the PCs to investigate 
rumors of poachers operating in the vale. A druid might be concerned 
about the overexploitation of the vale's trees and wildlife. A noble 
might have the same concerns, or perhaps portions of the vale or the 
slopes surrounding it (or both) are supposed to be the noble's private 
preserve and off limits to others.<br><br></li>
<li>A ranger, druid, or even a paladin has vanished after visiting the 
vale on a mission. Perhaps the missing character was seeking out 
poachers, as described above, or perhaps the character was sent to deal 
with the monsters that threaten the place seasonally. The PCs are asked 
to investigate.<br><br></li>
<li>Someone asks the PCs to investigate a rumor that the burial mounds 
in the vale had been broken into or that undead had suddenly begun 
haunting them. The missing NPC from the previous point might have gone 
to the vale to investigate the burials.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Exploring the Vale</b></p>
<p align="left">The vale has a several features worth investigating, as noted in the boxed text below and in the sections that follow:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">This winding valley looks verdant, but rugged. Dense 
trees and tendrils of cottony mist cover the surrounding slopes like 
layers of gauzy veil. The valley floor rises and falls in a series of 
folds and ridges. Most of these are just low hills with sides thick with
 grass and heather. Some of these are crowned with rows of long, low 
mounds with rounded tops. These mounds look as grassy as the hills where
 they lie.</p>
<p align="left">Other raised areas have sheer stone cliffs on two or 
three sides, and atop a few of these stand small huts with stone walls 
and roofs made of thatch. Most these dwellings have surrounding walls 
made of loosely piled stones. The grass in these areas looks closely 
cropped.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Though full of bucolic charm, the vale has its secrets, too.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Barrows</b></p>
<p align="left">Burial mounds from an ancient civilization sit atop many
 of the highest places in the vale. Each consists of a central cairn (or
 several of them) made of local stones, cut to shape and fitted together
 without mortar. The cairns are buried in several feet of packed earth 
formed into smooth, regular shapes, circles, ovals, and even a few 
toruses (a donut shape). Native grasses grow thick and green on the 
mounds.</p>
<p align="left">Local rumors allege that fabulous treasures are 
concealed within at least some of the mounds, but that all such 
treasures are under a terrible curse. It is said that even stepping on 
one of the mounds means death, especially at night. The rumors may or 
may not be true, but several of the mounds have undead guardians. 
Recently a band of grave robbers dug into one of the mounds, rousing the
 undead residing inside. If the PCs examine the mounds, they find one 
partially excavated.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 5, 7, or 10): </b>The mound builders 
placed undead guardians in or near the graves of their nobility. Shadows
 guarding the graves lie within the cairns. Guardian ghosts lurk nearby,
 but in the Ethereal Plane. The ghosts' bodies lie inside the cairns 
along with remains they're bound to protect.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shadows (2):</b> hp 19 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 221.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghosts (2):</b> hp 32 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 117.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Greater Shadows (2):</b> hp 58 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 221.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>Normally the undead lie quietly and 
react only if a mound is disturbed or breached. Since the attempted 
grave robbery, all the undead are restless. They remain out of sight by 
day, but stalk the hilltops at night. They attack anyone who so much as 
touches a mound.</p>
<p align="left">A shadow's favorite tactic is to glide along the surface
 of a mound with its body underground and its head moving through the 
grass. When attacking, it simply grabs a foe's ankles. This ploy gives 
the shadow cover (+4 to AC) while it fights.</p>
<p align="left">A ghost uses similar tactics, but they usually try to 
use their malevolence power once or twice before switching to corrupting
 touch.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Huts</b></p>
<p align="left">About half the huts have been vacant for years. One of 
these contains a battered set of armor and a few shreds of bloodstained 
equipment. See the end of the Development section for details.</p>
<p align="left">A mix of hunters, trappers, woodcutters, and shepherds 
occupy the rest (though the shepherds are here only during the spring 
and summer). As noted earlier, each hut has a surrounding wall made of 
unmortared stone. The walls surrounding the abandoned huts are falling 
apart. Not only are the elements tearing down the wall, but also the 
vale residents take stones to repair their own walls.</p>
<p align="left">The year-round residents grow vegetables in their walled
 yards and also keep geese and ducks. The shepherds use their enclosure 
to pen their sheep at night. During the day, they drive their flocks out
 to graze on the vale.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 4 or 6): </b>The shepherds live and 
work in pairs, each with four riding dogs for herding and guarding the 
sheep. The year-round residents are either loners or families with a 
single combatant in residence at any given time. Each of these 
households has two riding dogs.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Riding Dogs (2 or 4):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 272.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> These simple folk aren't looking for a 
fight and are willing to put up with considerable bluster from the PCs, 
so long as it's only verbal. If they feel they're in any real danger, 
they sic their dogs on the PCs and then shout for help. The nearest 
neighbors come running (1d3 shepherds and 1d3 hunters, trappers, or 
woodcutters, each with a dog). It will take each human/dog pair 1d10 
rounds to arrive at the scene. The locals don't pose much of a threat to
 the PCs, but an unlucky group could suffer some damage.</p>
<p align="left">In a fight, the dogs press the attack while the humans 
either drop back to make ranged attacks or maneuver into flanking 
positions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Development:</b> If the PCs are even somewhat 
friendly, these locals are happy to chat for a while. They can give 
brief descriptions of the notable areas in the vale, and they have some 
other information for the PCs, though not all of it is quite reliable. </p>
<ul>
<li>The barrow mounds? Stay away from there! Jubal's uncle Ogden plain 
up and died from just stepping on one! Hair turned white, heart stopped,
 it was awful! Or so they say, happened, oh, nigh onto forty years ago! 
Course, some folks a lot like you were here last summer and they just 
had to poke around. Dug a great big hole in one of the mounds. At least 
we think they did. Haven't seen hide nor hair of 'em since. Some say the
 wolves got 'em. I'm not so sure. What happened to all their gear? Tell 
me that!<br><br><i>The strangers succumbed to undead attacks; the PCs 
can find the hole they made (see the Barrows section). Later some 
centaurs visiting from their camp found the bodies and buried them.<br><br></i></li>
<li>Now if you want to see something really strange, poke around the 
base of that cliff yonder! You'll find all sorts of old bones down 
there, all stone. From stone giants, I guess. There's all sorts of 
peculiar carvings and paintings on the rocks -- from giants working 
small, I guess. You'll find that stuff all around here. Watch out, 
though. There's caves full of nasty beasts under the cliffs.<br><br><i>The
 speaker refers to the bonefields. The warning about monsters is 
genuine; the rest is pure speculation (and very far off the mark).<br><br></i></li>
<li> Then there's the old stone circle up over yonder. You can't see it 
through the trees. The centaurs use it as a burial ground, so we stay 
away from there. Oh yeah, there's centaurs about. You don't see 'em 
much. Sometimes they come here to trade for salt or to swap breeding 
stock. They run some sheep and goats in a bowl somewhere over the other 
side of the ridge.<br><br><i>This statement is accurate. If the PCs insist, they can get directions to the stone circle.</i></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Though everyone in the vale is willing to help each 
other in a pinch, there is currently some bad feeling in the vale. The 
PCs might hear both sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now a lone rider was poking around here just a few weeks ago asking a
 whole lot of questions about those strangers [the vanished grave 
robbers] and prying into everyone's business in general. Now it's a good
 bet that was really somebody sent by the earl just to get a look at 
what's going on up here. That earl owns half a mountain over and won't 
let nobody hunt on it, at least not till he been out hunting on it, and 
nobody here's got a problem with that. We all stay out of the earl's 
preserve, so he's got no cause to send to send any bailiffs up here 
snooping, no sir. 'Course those shepherds yakked all day. Probably said 
we'd been poaching. How do you like that?<br><br><i>This statement will come only from a trapper, hunter, or woodcutter.<br><br></i></li>

graze sheep on a wooded mountainside. We all stay out of the earl's 
preserve, so he's got no cause to send any bailiffs up here snooping, no
 sir. 'Course those squatters yakked all day. Probably said we'd been up
 there. Imagine that!<br><br><i>This statement will come only from a shepherd.</i></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">The mysterious "lone rider" might be a person the PCs 
are seeking. In fact, the rider spoke to almost everyone in the vale. 
It's up to you to decide what the NPC was doing in the vale. The 
character camped for the night in one of the abandoned huts and some of 
the local monsters attacked (see the Bonefields section). The mount 
fled, but the character died. The monsters devoured the corpse and 
shredded most of the character's equipment in the process.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bonefields</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs won't locate this area unless they poke around a
 bit (or get directions from the locals). In prehistoric times, 
primitive hunters periodically stampeded herds of game over some of the 
cliffs. The stony ground at the cliff bases are still littered with 
ossified bones and ancient rock art.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 3, 5, or 7):</b> A few dire rats, wolves, or ogres might lurk near any of the bonefields.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dire Rats (8):</b> hp 5 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 64.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wolves (4):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 283.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ogres (4):</b> hp 29 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 199.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The dire rats simply swarm over the PCs,
 trying to bite as many different characters as they can. The wolves 
split into two groups and try to attack the party from two sides at 
once. If they trip a PC, every wolf nearby attacks the prone character. 
The ogres pick out the strongest character and make a gang attack, 
hoping to cripple the party by knocking out the best fighter first.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stone Circle</b></p>
<p align="left">The same people who left the ancient artwork in the vale
 built this monument. The circle consists of a ring of menhirs about 90 
feet across with four massive boulders set outside at the cardinal 
points of the compass, plus one more positioned so that it lies directly
 below the rising sun on the summer solstice. The local centaur tribe 
keeps the place tidy. They use the circle for druidical ceremonies and 
as a landmark to fix one of their territorial boundaries.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 5, 6, or 7): </b>A small party of 
centaurs is encamped near the stone circle. They've been hunting and are
 currently busy drying over a smoky fire some of the meat they've 
harvested .</p>
<p align="left"><b>Centaurs (2 to 4)</b>: hp 26 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 32.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The centaurs resent any intrusions into 
their territory, but they're polite about it. If the PCs ask permission 
to stay awhile, the centaurs readily grant it. (They don't really mind 
trespassing, but they like to be asked first.) If insulted or attacked, 
they demand that the PCs leave, then attack if the group doesn't comply.
 In battle, they pick out the most belligerent PC and gang up on that 
character if possible. They get in close and use their many melee 
attacks to wear down the foe and perhaps convince the rest of the party 
that fighting isn't such a good idea. A centaur reduced to 10 or fewer 
hit points drops out of the melee but stays nearby to use its bow.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs decide to talk, they can learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stone circle is an ancient astronomical observatory, not any kind of burial site.<br><br></li>
<li>Some humanoids are buried near here. Some time ago a group of 
centaurs found four dead bodies near one of the burial mounds in the 
vale where the humans live. Realizing that these people didn't live in 
the vale, the centaurs carried the corpses into the forest and buried 
them. They thought about repairing the big hole these apparent grave 
robbers left in the mound, but thought better of it. Their tribal druid 
has warned them to stay away from the burial mounds.<br><br></li>
<li> There was a lone human on a white horse poking round these parts 
not long ago. The rider asked a whole lot of questions. The rider 
returned to the vale after talking to the centaurs and never returned.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">At your option, the centaurs might tell the PCs what 
kinds of questions the rider asked, and those will depend on what the 
NPC was doing in the area. Someone looking into poaching would have 
asked about activities in the vale. Someone looking into the grave 
robbing would have asked about the desecrated burial mound and probably 
also asked to see the graves where the suspected grave robbers were 
buried.</p>
