<p align="LEFT"> This stately white marble building features both a 
broad portico filled with grand pillars and a flight of wide steps 
leading up to it. A low dome rises behind the portico. The building 
certainly seems noble and worthy, but what goes on behind its doors? Are
 the armed guards standing at the entrance merely a prudent measure, or a
 grim necessity?</p>

 Chapter One: Order in the Court. Included is a map of the Court of the 
High Tower, which can be used for Vicious Venues' courthouse.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The ruler who governs the area where the courthouse 
stands had the edifice built to house all the machinery of justice: a 
jail, constable's headquarters, law library, archives for legal records 
of all types, courtrooms for trying cases, and a few other facilities 
(see Visiting the Courthouse, below).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though the courthouse provides a strictly secular 
function, the clergy of Heironeous (or some other deity suitable for 
your campaign) is deeply involved in its day-to-day operations. The 
ruler who had the place built realized that divine magic would prove 
invaluable for separating the innocent from the guilty and reasoned that
 people dedicated to a god of justice could be expected to dispense 
justice better than anyone else. This has generated some resentment 
among citizens of other faiths.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The staff at the courthouse does its work well and no 
one has any legitimate complaints about how the place is run. The 
courthouse is the center of a long-running effort to fight crime and 
corruption at all levels of society. As such the people who work there 
are heroes to some and hated enemies to others.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2003-20%20-%20Courthouse_files/dx0320vv_viciousvenues_courthouse.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="248" width="240">The
 courthouse is best located in a fairly large city; perhaps one where 
some vast criminal enterprise (such as a thieves guild) holds sway or 
once held sway. The building stands not far from the city's commercial 
center.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters might visit the courthouse in the 
course of their own activities, especially if they attempt to purchase 
real estate or write a legal will. Characters with a taste for mysteries
 will find the courthouse archives invaluable. Of course, characters who
 run afoul of the law might view the courthouse from a different angle.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters also might become involved in courthouse business in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li> The authorities offer a considerable reward for capturing a notorious criminal or breaking up a criminal cartel.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs might simply hear about the reward, or someone might offer them the job directly.</p>
<ul>
<li> A player character is mistaken for an infamous criminal and is either arrested or becomes a fugitive from the law.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The mistake could arise simply because the unfortunate 
PC resembles the criminal, or perhaps the criminal's true identity is a 
mystery and the PC is misidentified because of a piece of gear or 
treasure he or she has acquired.</p>
<ul>
<li> A player character receives counterfeit coins (or a phony piece of 
gear). This ensnares the character in the search for the counterfeiter.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The character might be arrested for passing a 
counterfeit coin, or another victim might approach the character and 
propose finding the culprit.</p>
<ul>
<li> A fire, earthquake, or other calamity leaves the legal ownership of
 several buildings or other properties in doubt. The legitimate owners 
become locked in arguments over property lines and plans for rebuilding.
 At least one con artist complicates matters by pressing a false claim 
of ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Unraveling the mess would require at least one visit to 
the archives in the courthouse and one trip to the ruins to sift through
 the wreckage for clues.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Courthouse (EL 2-6)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The courthouse was built to look solid and imposing, and
 it does. The text below depicts the courthouse in daylight. At night, 
lamps with <i>continual flame</i> spells light the main entry and the 
square below. The flickering light gives the place a brooding, 
fortresslike appearance. The text also assumes that clerics of 
Heironeous administer the courthouse. Adjust things accordingly if 
another deity is more suitable for your campaign.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT"> A massive stone building looms above a small plaza 
where a statue of the god Heironeous stands. The god wears a blindfold 
and holds a sword and a pair of scales. The figure shows Heironeous in 
his role as justice bringer.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A wide flight of white marble steps leads up from the 
plaza to a pillared hall with a soaring pediment above. A medallion with
 the symbol of Heironeous (a hand holding a lightning bolt) adorns the 
pediment. A low dome studded with small, round windows rises behind the 
pediment. Two rambling wings, each at least three stories high, extend 
left and right from the dome. Arched windows protected by wrought iron 
grilles run in orderly rows along the wings.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures: </b>At least one constable always stands 
guard at the head of the stairs. The constables not only protect the 
courthouse, they also direct visitors to the correct area in the 
courthouse. The constables are fighters or paladins dedicated to 
Heironeous.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Courthouse guards (1-4):</b> 2nd-level fighters and paladins, hp 19 or 17 each; see pages 117 and 120 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>The constables try to remain friendly 
but they act quickly if they perceive any threat to them or to the 
courthouse. In battle, they attempt to block the entrance to the 
courthouse. They try to identify the biggest troublemaker in any 
opposing group and eliminate that character first.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Development: </b>A fight on the steps could bring out every fighting character in the courthouse; see the entries in the next section.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Courtrooms (EL 10)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2003-20%20-%20Courthouse_files/dx0320vv_viciousvenues_bear.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="141" width="240">There
 are several chambers where magistrates hear civil and criminal cases. 
Each has a raised platform where the magistrate sits and smaller 
platforms for witnesses and defendants. Additional seating is provided 
for witnesses waiting to give testimony, and for folks who wish to watch
 the proceedings.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures:</b> When court is in session, a 
courtroom's staff includes at least one magistrate (sometimes as many as
 three), a bailiff, and a recorder. Once such trio includes Gavra, a 
cleric of Heironeous (magistrate); Adair, a paladin of Heironeous 
(recorder); and Arthur, a werebear (bailiff).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gavra:</b> hp 53; see the Personalities section.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Adair:</b> hp 18; see the Personalities section.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Arthur:</b> hp 62 (<i>MM</i> 170).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> When hearing most cases, Gavra and her staff don't take too many special precautions beyond a <i>zone of truth</i>
 spell from Gavra if she feels the need. For important cases or cases 
where the staff fears outside interference, the staff arranges for 
protective spells such as <i>dimensional lock</i> or <i>forbiddance</i>; these spells are usually cast by characters specifically hired for the purpose.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If violence erupts in her courtroom, Gavra usually tries to quell the outburst with a <i>greater command</i>
 spell (she commands subjects to halt or flee). After Gavra casts her 
spell, Arthur and Adair move in to capture the villains. If her initial 
spell fails, Gavra uses <i>flame strike,</i> then <i>holy smite.</i> If the fight goes longer than that, Gavra casts <i>divine power</i> and <i>divine favor,</i> then joins the fray herself.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While Gavra casts her spells, Arthur and Adair try to 
protect her. Arthur assumes hybrid form to improve his attack 
capability. Adair attempts to use his smite evil power against a likely 
looking foe.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Elsewhere in the Courthouse</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The courthouse contains several distinct areas, some open to the public, some not.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rotunda:</b> The chamber directly under the dome 
serves as a common area for the courthouse. At least one constable is 
always on duty in here (same statistics as the guards on the steps). 
During the day, a handful of townsfolk are taking a break from business 
in the courthouse or taking advantage of the public space to conduct 
business or meet friends.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shrine to Heironeous:</b> A small worship space is 
provided behind the rotunda for folk who feel the need to pray for 
justice. One or two clerics and paladins of Heironeous (levels 1-4) are 
always on hand to attend supplicants. Use the statistics from pages 115 
and 120 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Archives: </b>Two vast archives fill the top floors 
in both of the courthouse's wings. One contains books and scrolls 
dealing with laws in general and also with various court proceedings; 
the other holds legal records, such as contracts and deeds for 
properties.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Constable Barracks and Armory:</b> This area is home 
to around fifty constables and watch members, about half of whom are 
present at any given time (the remainder are off doing their rounds). 
The constables also keep about a dozen guard dogs and riding dogs to 
assist with their work. Constables are 1st- or 2nd-level paladins, 
fighters, or rangers. Watch members are 1st- or 2nd-level warriors.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Jail:</b> The courthouse basement includes a secure 
area for holding prisoners awaiting trial or serving very short penal 
sentences. Two cells have permanent <i>antimagic fields;</i> prisoners 
with magical abilities (or who might attempt escape with magical aid) 
are kept there. There also is as small, secret chamber used (fortunately
 not often) for executions. This, too, has an <i>antimagic field.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Personalities</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The two leading members of the courthouse staff are Gavra, senior magistrate, Adair, her recorder, and Arthur, her bailiff.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gavra</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2003-20%20-%20Courthouse_files/dx0320vv_viciousvenues_heiro.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="147" width="185">Gavra
 spent several years as an adventurer and itinerant proselytizer for her
 deity, Heironeous. She realized, however, that the roaming life just 
wasn't for her. Never particularly adroit, she feared that her life 
would end ignominiously when she tumbled into some bottomless pit, or --
 worse -- when she failed to react quickly enough to save her companions
 from an ambush. She also felt that plenty of stalwart souls were ready 
and willing to go far afield and face evil wherever it hides, but very 
few were willing to stay at home and root out hidden evils. So, she 
retired from adventuring and joined the city watch. Her superiors 
quickly realized she was wasted walking a beat (though she proved an 
excellent detective) and quickly secured a judicial appointment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As a magistrate, Gavra is empowered to dispense what is 
commonly called low justice. She hears both civil and criminal cases and
 can hand down some severe punishments, but not the death penalty (a 
limitation for which Gavra is grateful). She makes her judgments without
 the benefit of a jury, though she is free to consult with the 
courthouse staff and with other magistrates if she feels the need.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Gavra isn't a big believer in imprisonment for 
criminals, or in maiming, flogging, or other excruciating punishments. 
She feels that imprisonment is just a waste of resources and that 
brutality, even judicial brutality, is just another evil. Instead, Gavra
 prefers to make convicted criminals pay some kind of restitution to 
their victims, usually in the form of a cash payment or some form of 
labor or both. A thief who is forced to do several honest days' work 
might be less inclined to steal thereafter.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She is legally entitled to keep any fines she levies, 
but she always makes sure money she collects goes to the victim of the 
crime, to the community, or to the church of Heironeous. She survives on
 a small stipend from the church and another from the secular ruler she 
serves.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Adair</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The third son of a minor noble family, Adair was groomed
 for the priesthood from childhood. Adair writes with a lovely, flowing 
hand, and he was headed for the cloister and a life copying and 
illustrating manuscripts when he was sent with a group of monks to carry
 a load of rare tomes to a distant monastery. The trip proved hazardous,
 and wolves, dire wolves, and even a minor demon assailed the group. By 
the time he returned home, it became clear that Adair's faith was 
strong, but so was his heart and his right arm. After a heart-to-heart 
with his abbot, Adair underwent training as a paladin. After completing 
several missions for his church, Gavra invited him to become her 
personal scribe and sometime bodyguard. Adair accepted the post, hoping 
to learn something about justice and criminal investigation.</p>
