<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">An abandoned temple beckons adventurers with the promise of great riches -- if the PCs can figure out how to reach them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Background for the DM</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 altar of ghostly wealth was once the heart of a temple dedicated to an 
evil deity. It was so named because of the unusual method the priests 
used to safeguard their offertory implements. The temple's collection of
 chalices, salvers, censers, and other ritual objects was placed in 
safekeeping on the Ethereal Plane, using an effect similar to a 
permanent <i>Leomund's secret chest</i> spell, except that the priests 
could make the items visible to worshipers on the Prime Material Plane 
(see The Altar, below). When the items were on display, people could see
 them, but anyone who tried to touch or take the items would find his or
 her hands passing right through them.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ruined temple containing the altar could be located just about 
anywhere, but placing it underground or in some secluded outdoor locale 
is best. If located underground, the temple simply can be part of a 
dungeon. If outdoors, the temple might be a lone ruin or part of a lost 
city. In any case, the temple's interior should be dark and forbidding. 
In a dungeon, achieving the right atmosphere is a snap, since dungeons 
always seem at least a little dark and scary. If outdoors, the temple 
might be overgrown with giant trees or leafy vines that cast the 
temple's interior into a cool, perpetual gloom.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Setup</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs might learn about the altar through rumors of a ghostly treasure 
that can be seen, but not touched. Or they might receive a treasure map 
to the altar chamber, along with cryptic notes about a ghostly treasure.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Entering the Altar Chamber</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The chamber containing the altar has one entrance: a pair of huge double doors.</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 shadowed depths of a shallow alcove half conceal the titanic likeness 
of a leering face with demonic features and an obscenely long tongue. 
The image covers a pair of great bronze valves, each nearly as wide as a
 human is tall and twice as high. The metal's surface has become pitted 
and green with age, making the face seem diseased and ghastly. The seam 
between the two valves runs down the middle of the bas relief face like 
some horrible scar.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 frame around the massive doorway has been carved to resemble a writhing
 mass of biting vipers. Humanoid limbs and torsos are visible here and 
there in the mass of serpent bodies, as though struggling, futilely, to 
win free of the snakes' rapacious coils. The area has a parched and sour
 odor, like a kettle left to boil dry. Countless tiny bones and bone 
fragments crackle underfoot like dry autumn leaves.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 alcove is about 3 feet deep. The litter of bones in the alcove 
represents the leavings from some predator that once made its lair above
 there. At the DM's option, this creature could still be present (see 
Creatures, below).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Despite
 their fearsome look, the doors pose no threat. They're old, but 
harmless by themselves. A pressure plate on the floor triggers a set of 
counterweights that opens the doors whenever a weight of at least 100 
pounds is placed in the alcove. A search of the alcove (DC 20) reveals 
the pressure plate, which looks just like a trap to any adventurer. A 
successful Disable Device check (DC 20) jams the plate but also jams the
 doors shut. An exceptionally successful Disable Device check (DC 30) 
allows a rogue or character with the stonecunning ability to surmise the
 plate's true function. In any case, the doors must be forced open 
unless the plate is depressed. In the latter case, the doors swing 
slowly inward with hardly a sound.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Bronze Doors:</b> 2 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 40; AC 5; break DC 27 (when stuck).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 2, 3, or 5):</b> Some crafty hunter might lurk near the alcove -- perhaps a choker, ethereal marauder, or phase spider.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Choker:</b> hp 16; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>The
 alcove resident waits quietly in hiding until the PCs become 
preoccupied with the doors or with the pressure plate that activates 
them, then picks out a likely looking victim (preferably a character who
 has grown impatient or bored with the search) and attacks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Beyond the Doors</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The altar is only a short walk from the doors.</span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 draft of cool, dry air that bears the scent of dust and mold escapes as
 the great doors open. Beyond is a vast, dreary chamber with a vaulted 
ceiling. Cracked pillars stand in a double row like tired soldiers. 
Chunks of fallen masonry lie scattered all about. Here and there, a 
translucent globe, covered with centuries of grime, gives off a feeble 
light.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">About a bowshot away, a cloak of shadows conceals a low mass of stone.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ceiling is about 60 feet overhead, and the chamber is some 80 feet long
 and half that wide. The pillars form an aisle about 40 feet wide down 
the center, and there are two side aisles, each 20 feet wide. There are 
half a dozen pillars in each row, and about a third of them have iron 
sconces bearing lanterns of glass and iron. Inside each lantern burns a <i>continual flame</i> spell. An intact lantern is almost identical to an <i>everburning torch</i>
 (except that it looks like a lantern), but the glass in the lanterns is
 currently so dirty that each gives off only as much light as a candle.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 altar is on top of a dais at the far end of the chamber, flanked by 
four massive pillars that support a vault about 80 feet high.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 character with the stonecunning ability who makes a successful Search 
check (DC 15) can tell that the debris on the floor is from pillars and 
the ceiling. The stonework in here is sound, but some deterioration has 
occurred over the years.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Altar</span></b></span></p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 short flight of steps leads up 3 or 4 feet to a raised platform bearing
 a massive slab of silver-white marble about waist high to a human and 
large enough for a human, or even an ogre, to recline on with some room 
to spare. A layer of dust and broken masonry covers the slab and the 
dais.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 base of the slab has the same serpent motif as the doorway into this 
place. A large area of chipped stone on the slab's front suggests that 
it once bore a sculpture in low relief, but it has been almost 
completely defaced, and the area bears some dark scorch marks.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Several humanoid skeletons and loose bones lie on the dais around slab.</span></p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The debris here has fallen from the ceiling, just as it has in the rest of the chamber.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 damage to the altar occurred years ago when members of a rival sect 
broke into the chamber and defaced it. They did considerable damage 
before the chamber's guardians (see the Creatures section, below) drove 
them off. The scorch marks came from a <i>lightning bolt.</i></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 skeletons are the remains of previous visitors to this chamber who fell
 afoul of the altar's guardians (see the Creatures section, below). A 
search through bones takes about 5 minutes, but a successful Search 
check (DC 10) reveals a skeletal hand still clutching a scrap of 
parchment. The parchment contains a rubbing of some archaic characters 
and a short passage written in Common. Any literate character can read 
the Common:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eyes, ears, hands, feet<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Work together their goals to meet.<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Brain, nose, tongue, heart<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Work alone to do their part.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 verse in the parchment is a partial translation of the rubbing, which 
contains cryptic instructions for accessing the altar's goodies. The 
rubbing is written in an archaic form of Common, and it can be read with
 a Decipher Script check (DC 30) or a <i>comprehend languages </i>spell.
 (If a map leads the PCs to this place, it might contain parts of the 
verse, or the full verse.) The full verse reads as follows:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eyes, ears, hands, and feet<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Work together their goals to meet.<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Brain, nose, tongue, and heart<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Work alone to do their part.<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The body star provides the key.<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Two pairs and one to open me.<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">But all efforts fail unless they start<br></span><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From one place only, the depths of heart.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 party can examine the altar without too much risk; however, if the 
characters do anything to damage the altar, or if they touch the top of 
the altar, they trigger the trap that protects it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 successful Search check (DC 20) on the damaged section in front of the 
altar reveals that the whole section is made of sliding panels, though 
no mechanism for operating them is evident. Both ends of the altar have 
sliding bronze panels that each bear the same leering face the PCs saw 
at the entrance to this chamber. They can slide together to form 
complete images or open up to split the images.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Examining the altar with <i>see invisibility</i><b></b>or <i>true seeing </i>effects
 reveals an exquisite collection of altar plate and jeweled chalices 
resting atop the altar (these items are actually on the Ethereal Plane).
 It also reveals several gaunt humanoid figures looming over the 
collection and snarling at the viewer. A <i>detect magic </i>effect aimed at the altar reveals strong magic of the Transmutation school.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Accessing the Items: </b>The
 cryptic message on the parchment means that accessing the treasure is a
 two-step process. The first step requires two people, each sliding the 
panels on one end of the altar. The panels must be brought together, 
then simultaneously moved apart. When accomplished correctly, this 
action opens the front of the altar to reveal a circle of twelve flat 
black stones -- like the face of a clock without numbers.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Touching
 these stones brings the altar's collection of ritual items out of 
storage on the Ethereal Plane. Position 12 on the "clock" is the 
uppermost stone. One person must simultaneously touch stones 6, 4, 8, 2,
 and 10. (The last two lines are meant to imply that the "body star" 
must point down.) A careful person can manage the trick by standing on 
her head and touching the stones with both knees, both hands, and her 
nose, chin, or tongue, but doing so requires some coordination (DC 15 
Balance check). The items cannot be retrieved if the magic trap 
protecting the altar has been deactivated (because doing so also 
deactivates the magic that brings the items out of the Ethereal Plane).</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Traps:</b>
 The altar has been enspelled with two powerful magical effects. The 
first calls forth undead creatures to attack thieves and vandals. The 
second effect is not really a trap, but it serves to recall the 
ceremonial items that rest on the Ethereal Plane.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Undead Release Trap:</b> CR 8; magic device; location/touch trigger; search DC 32; disable device DC 32.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Notes:</b> A dozen undead creatures are held under the dais in permanent <i>forcecage</i>
 effects. When anything touches the top of the altar without first 
deactivating the trap, from one to four of these creatures are released 
to attack the intruder (see the Creatures section). The undead remain 
for up to 1 hour before returning to their cells. Undead also are 
released when anyone damages the altar or manipulates the secret "clock"
 at the front of the altar incorrectly.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The trap has a caster level of 13. A successful targeted <i>dispel magic</i>
 effect deactivates this trap, but it also prevents anyone from 
activating the altar and recovering the treasure stored on the Ethereal 
Plane during that time.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL variable): </b>A cadre of incorporeal undead creatures guard the altar. As noted earlier, a dozen of these creatures are inside <i>forcecage</i>
 cells located beneath the dais where the altar rests. At the DM's 
option, one to four of these creatures might already be out and lurking 
near the altar (released by debris falling from the ceiling). In 
addition, each time the trap protecting the altar is triggered, one to 
four (also the DM's option) more creatures come forth whenever needed.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Shadows (12):</b> hp 19 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wraiths (12):</b> hp 32 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spectres (12):</b> hp 45 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 When released, the creatures rise up out of the floor and attack anyone
 they find in the area. They tend to remain partially hidden in the 
floor, altar or dais, and gain three-quarters cover. If successfully 
turned, they sink into the floor and remain there until the effect wears
 off, then return to the fight. If reduced to 5 hit points or less, they
 return to their cells and do not leave (even if released again) until 
they recover all their lost hot points.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Treasure:</b>
 The collection of altar items includes two jeweled chalices, two golden
 salvers, and a censer. Their values depend on what guards them:</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Shadows:</i> Chalices, 500 gp each; salvers, 100 gp each; censer, 1,400 gp.</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Wraiths:</i> Chalices, 900 gp each; salvers, 250 gp each; censer, 2,200 gp.</span><br><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Spectres:</i> Chalices, 1,200 gp each; salvers, 400 gp each; censer, 4,300 gp.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">On the Ethereal Plane</span></b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Parties
 with access to the Ethereal Plane travel might simply go to the 
Ethereal Plane and try to seize the items. If they do so, they discover 
that the altar items are encased in a block of solid crystal, and four 
undead creatures (of the same type that guards the altar) defend the 
block.</span></p>

 spell would destroy the whole block and its contents). The PCs must 
burrow through about 3 1/2 feet (48 inches) of stone to reach the 
treasure at the center of the block</span></p>
