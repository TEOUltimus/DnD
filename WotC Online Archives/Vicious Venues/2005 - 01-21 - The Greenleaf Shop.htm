<p align="left">The Greenleaf Shop keeps visitors guessing. It has a 
distinctive sign (a fresh-looking green leaf that seems literally to 
grow from the door), but it doesn't sell herbs. Its amazing window 
display offers a better clue to what customers might find inside: It 
features an ever-changing array of fine clothing and a pair of miniature
 knights locked in a perpetual joust. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The Greenleaf Shop sells magic supplies and some minor 
magic items. The proprietor, Nimro Meadowspinner, has a penchant for 
frivolous items (such as toys, singing teakettles, and dancing cutlery) 
that hold little appeal for adventurers. Nevertheless, he does a steady 
business with customers who have money to spend and a taste for a little
 magic in their lives.</p>
<p align="left">Nimro is a rarity, at least among his human neighbors. 
He's a chubby, elderly elf. At a mere 4 feet 7 inches tall, he weighs 
145 pounds. However, his features are unmistakably elven; he has pointed
 ears, crystalline green eyes, and silvery hair. He also has fleshy 
jowls, a flabby body, and deft, but pudgy, fingers. He enjoys good food 
and wine, and he consumes plenty of both.</p>
<p align="left">Nimro has a broad array of useful skills and a taste for
 whimsical magic. He'd rather sit and work at a craft than engage in 
more active pursuits such as hunting or adventuring. Soon after reaching
 adulthood, he came to feel that his fellow elves didn't fully 
appreciate his talents, so he headed for a human city. He believed his 
knack for magic and fine craftwork would allow him a good living among 
humans, and he was right. He has been very happy here, and he is known 
as a jolly soul.</p>
<p align="left">The Greenleaf Shop is located on the fringes of the 
elven district in a major city, or perhaps in a village or small town 
with a fairly large elf population. His customers are a mixture of 
practical people looking for useful items (such as <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_spell')">spell</a> component pouches, quills, and minor potions) and well-heeled individuals who are drawn to Nimro's more fanciful wares.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs might stumble onto the Greenleaf Shop while 
replenishing their supplies between adventures, or something might draw 
their attention to the place:</p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs are having a meal or taking a break at an inn when a chance
 remark sets the crockery in motion. Perhaps a mustard pot takes up a 
spoon and begins slathering condiments all over the tabletop, or 
someone's mug starts a ribald, drunken song. The display might draw some
 snide comments about "magical pranks" from fellow patrons. If the PCs 
question the staff (who are just as astonished as PCs), they discover 
that the magic tableware came from a pawnshop or estate sale. The buyers
 had no idea the stuff was magical.<br><br> Nimro has been in business a
 long time, and some of his shorter-lived customers have left behind 
some of his wares without letting anyone know about their magical 
nature. The PCs have stumbled across some of Nimro's earliest work, when
 he wasn't too careful about the command words he assigned. If the PCs 
make an effort, they can track the items back to their creator, and 
Nimro might offer to buy them back for sentimental reasons.<br><br></li>
<li>A ruler or prominent citizen has been assassinated in a bizarre 
attack -- the attacker was a piece of clothing, furniture, or other 
household item. The PCs are called upon to investigate (perhaps because 
they know the victim, or just because they're hired for the job). 
Suspicion naturally falls upon Nimro and his performing utensils. Nimro,
 however, lacks the magical aptitude to make anything dangerous. The 
real assassin might have set out to frame Nimro, or perhaps the killer 
merely found inspiration at the Greenleaf Shop.<br><br></li>
<li> Nimro has vanished, and his neighbors hire the PCs to find out what
 happened to him. Perhaps the old elf merely left town in a hurry to 
pursue some errand, or perhaps an old rival has finally caught up to 
him. (Nimro's reason for leaving his elven brethren might have been more
 urgent than mere dissatisfaction with his lot in life.)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Shop</b></p>
<p align="left">The Greenleaf Shop is located in a stone building with 
the store on the ground floor and living space above. A first-time 
visitor might have a hard time deciding exactly what the place sells. 
The text below depicts the shop on a typical business day.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The stone building has a stout wooden door with what 
seems to be a living branch growing from it. A single green leaf, bright
 as spring, hangs from the branch. A big leaded glass window (none too 
clean) shows a display of crockery, clothing, and toys. The assortment 
of toys includes a pair of tiny knights, who seem to be conducting a 
joust. A small plaque under the leafy branch reads: "Magical curiosities
 sold here -- step right in."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">When the store is closed, the window is shuttered and 
the plaque is gone from the door. The branch and leaf on the door look 
natural, but they're artificial. Nimro chose the decoration to remind 
him of his woodland home.</p>
<p align="left">Inside, the shop seems dim, but it has a pleasant smell 
because of the herbs and rare woods that Nimro keeps on hand to scent 
the air. The shop consists of a single room lined with shelves on three 
sides. The fourth wall holds the door and the window. In the center is a
 small workshop where Nimro makes his wares. A waist-high counter forms a
 square around the workspace. Inside, Nimro has a small furnace, an 
anvil, and many tools for woodworking and metalworking. He also has 
laboratory equipment for making magic items.</p>
<p align="left">Read or paraphrase the following when someone enters Nimro's shop.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="left">"Well, well, well, hello there!" says an unusually pudgy
 elf. Dressed in a red suit with a white workman's apron over it, he 
sits behind a counter and is surrounded by tools and pieces of cutlery. 
"Come to find that perfect gift for someone? How about a nice singing 
teakettle? Mine do the latest songs. This one sings beautifully," he 
says, coming out from behind the counter and plucking a kettle from the 
shelf, "but it never seems to get the lyrics quite right. I could give 
it to you at half-price, though. Or maybe you'd like something to make 
your entertaining simpler? I have knives that cut meat and vegetables, 
pitchers that automatically keep glasses filled, and shakers that season
 food on request.</p>
<p align="left">"How about a toy for that special child, or someone 
young at heart? Kids and adults alike love my jousting knights and 
battling dragons. The market is somewhat more limited for the miniature 
cat burglar, though. Kids sometimes use it to filch money from their 
parents' pouches, so I get a lot of returns on that item. Ho, ho, ho!" 
he laughs, his considerable girth vibrating with the sound.</p>
<p align="left">"Maybe a nice new cloak?" he says, stepping around to a 
clothing rack. "My cloaks and accessories go with anything, you know. 
They match any garb, and you never have to worry about stains on them. 
Suits of clothing are available with the same features -- you can go 
from working clothes to evening wear without having to change.</p>
<p align="left">"Or are you looking for something more practical? I have
 a small selection of adventuring gear for those who get their 
excitement from exploring deadly ruins and such. That sort of life isn't
 for me, though -- I prefer to use my talents to make others happy.</p>
<p align="left">"Look around as much as you like, and feel free to ask questions. Gift wrapping and delivery is free with any purchase."</p>
</td>

<p align="left">As noted above, Nimro sells practical items such as 
spell component pouches, tindertwigs, and everburning torches. He also 
sells potions, but only very minor ones (market-priced 50 gp or below). 
Nimro makes most, but not all, of the potions he sells.</p>
<p align="left">The items that make the Greenleaf Shop memorable are the
 magic trinkets that Nimro designs and sells. Some of his more popular 
items are described below, but Nimro has dozens, if not hundreds, of 
similar items.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nimro's Self-Propelled Objects: </b>These little 
devices are generally of Diminutive or Fine size. They are cleverly 
articulated to allow movement and imbued with some mobility. They are 
not animated objects (such magic is beyond Nimro's wizardly power), but 
more like self-winding toys. Items in this category include dancing 
marionettes, marching toy soldiers, jousting toy knights, automatic 
mustard pots and sugar bowls, self-pouring pitchers, and the like. They 
are mindless and can perform only those tasks for which they are made, 
though a single object might be programmed to perform several different 
tasks, each activated by a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_commandworditem')">command word</a>.
 If commanded to act, a device keeps repeating the same action until 
commanded to stop. Anyone who knows the proper command word can operate 
the device, provided she is within 10 feet of the device. Most items 
function three times a day. A typical device has the following 
statistics:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Diminutive Object:</b><a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hardness')">Hardness </a> 5; <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_hit%20points')">hp</a> 5; <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_ArmorClass')">AC</a> 14, break <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_DifficultyClass')">DC</a> 20.</p>
<p align="left">A Diminutive device has a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Strength')">Strength</a> score of 2, a <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_Dexterity')">Dexterity</a> score of 10, and a land <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_speed')">speed</a> of 15.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fine Object:</b> Hardness 5; hp 2; AC 18, break DC 20.</p>
<p align="left">A Fine device has a Strength score of 1, a Dexterity score of 10, and a land speed of 5.</p>
<p align="left">A device cannot attack, but it can trigger traps and 
such, though its Strength score limits the amount of force it can exert 
(20 pounds for a Diminutive device, 10 pounds for a Fine device). A 
device can't be programmed to perform any task that requires a skill 
check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill 
that can't be used untrained.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Nimro's Convertible Garb: </b>These finely tailored 
items of apparel can change color on command, up to three times each 
day. In addition to changing color, the item can alter itself in some 
small way by becoming fuller or tighter, longer or shorter, or some 
similar change in size or shape, but no more than 1 foot longer or 
shorter. Each change lasts up to 50 minutes, or until the user commands 
another change.</p>
<p align="left">An item can be commanded to clean itself or dry itself, 
also up to three times a day. A cleaned or dried item stays that way 
until it gets wet or dirty again. </p>
<p align="left">Nimro designed these garments for the fashion conscious; however, a character who uses one of them in a disguise gets a +1 <a class="glosstext" href="javascript:autoGlossaryWindow('Glossary_dnd_circumstancebonus')">circumstance bonus</a>

<p align="left"><b>Nimro's Singing Receptacles: </b>Nimro makes most of 
his singing receptacles from high quality ceramics. He favors mugs, 
teakettles, cookie jars, and other household items. Most of these items 
are programmed to recite a poem or sing a song in response to a specific
 condition up to three times a day. Nimro is most proud of his 
teakettles, which whistle when filled with boiling water and sing in 
tune when they whistle. A mug might sing when filled or upon being 
emptied.</p>
<p align="left">All these items have a special sound box incorporated 
into the design, and the item's ability to "sing" is generated there. 
None of these items can respond to visible triggers or verbal commands; 
they can respond only to being handled, filled, emptied, or some other 
similar condition.</p>

</blockquote>
