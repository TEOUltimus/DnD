<p align="LEFT"> The island, remote but located a mere stone's throw 
from a bustling settlement, is famous for its fishing and infamous for 
the clouds of insects swarming over its marshy shores. An unlikely band 
of squatters has gathered on the island in recent months. Are these 
simple fishermen, or do they have a darker purpose?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2006-19%20-%20Fishermen%27s%20Island_files/dx0619vv_viciousvenues_greenspawn.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="332" width="243">Fishermen's
 Island has long been a local landmark. The shoals and banks around its 
shores make the place a hazard for ships but provide excellent breeding 
and hunting grounds for many kinds of fish. Fisherfolk from all over the
 area visit the place, at least from time to time, to improve their 
catches. The island is very small, and its swampy terrain has 
discouraged settlement until recently.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A short time ago, an eclectic group of squatters 
established a foothold on the island. Most of the group consists of 
lizardfolk, but the mix also includes a few seagoing halflings, some 
salty humans, and a handful of other humanoids. The squatters have done 
their best to fit in with the locals. They fish mostly with hooks and 
lines (and a few small nets). They eke out a living selling their modest
 catches in the local markets. Though not particularly outgoing or 
friendly, they have offered invaluable assistance to the local fishing 
fleet. They readily share information about where fish can be found, 
give warnings about shifts in the weather, and have performed at least 
one daring rescue when a fishing boat got into trouble.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unbeknownst to everyone living near the island (and even
 to most of the squatters living on the island), a greenspawn sneak (see
 <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/953767200">Monster Manual IV</a></i>)
 named Kroodrax is behind the colony here. The extremely agile and 
quick-witted Kroodrax takes his mission to serve his deity, Tiamat, very
 seriously indeed. He longed to become a powerful leader in greenspawn 
sneak society but lacked any true potential for divine magic, which is 
an essential requirement for attaining authority among his kind. 
Instead, Kroodrax showed an aptitude for working undercover. His flair 
for stealth and disguise allowed him to pass unnoticed among humanoids 
and spy on them. Kroodrax's superiors understand his desires and his 
assets, and they have directed him to set up a long-term spying 
operation where he can keep tabs on commerce, politics, and military 
activity in his area. Kroodrax wasn't given any other greenspawn sneaks 
to command, but he was allowed to recruit assistants. In this way, 
Kroodrax's superiors hoped to make the best use of his skills while also
 satisfying his urge to command others.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Kroodrax eagerly undertook his mission. He chose 
Fishermen's Island as an ideal base of operations because it offers both
 security and excellent cover. He recruited a band of lizardfolk for 
protection and set to work. He has been spying energetically, and he 
also has performed a few robberies and assassinations. In his spare 
time, he fishes (to maintain his cover) and indoctrinates his servants 
in the joys of serving Tiamat (to satisfy his own urge to venerate his 
queen). Much of the time, Kroodrax poses as Kurian Troutspearer, a 
tallfellow halfling, with the help of his Disguise skill. He has also 
posed as a young lizardfolk, a merfolk youth, and a locathah youth. 
Although he's at the heart of the activities on the island, he tries to 
stay out of the public eye as much as possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Kroodrax's activities have attracted several genuine 
fishermen to the island -- a fact that serves to strengthen his cover. 
Only Kroodrax's inner circle is part of the small cult of Tiamat he has 
created.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Thus far, Kroodrax's plans are working very well. He 
doesn't know it, but they're beginning to work too well. Many of the 
island's new residents are starting to appreciate the value of commerce 
and the value of an honest day's work. Unless Kroodrax weeds out these 
"malcontents" soon, he risks discovery and exposure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Fishermen's Island is located about one day's sail from a
 port town or city -- close enough to allow some contact between the 
island and the larger settlement, but far enough away to discourage 
casual visits. The location presented here is in a sheltered estuary 
(where a major river meets the sea), but the place could just as easily 
be located in a major river or on a big lake.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Despite its fairly remote location, the island is a 
hotbed of activity, and player characters might be inclined to visit for
 a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A courier carrying vital documents has mysteriously vanished in the 
town or city near the island. The courier was last seen booking passage 
for a ship out of the port. She paid the required fee but did not appear
 when the ship was ready to leave. Some of her gear was already on 
board, but the missing documents were not. The PCs are hired to 
determine the courier's fate and recover the documents.<br><br> 
Waylaying the courier was a major coup for Kroodrax. He has the missing 
documents, but they are encrypted and he cannot decipher them. He has 
the documents hidden in the shrine and is waiting for a chance to pass 
them to his superiors.<br><br></li>
<li>The spawning cycle for a certain rare and commercially valuable fish
 is about to begin. Fishermen's Island is their prime spawning ground in
 this region. A consortium of merchants, politicians, and druids -- in a
 rare display of unity -- is concerned that the local population of this
 fish might be endangered by the extra activity on the island, so they 
hire PCs to protect the fish.<br><br> Kroodrax could care less about the
 fish, but he doesn't like the PCs snooping around his island and he'll 
try to drive them off if he can.<br><br></li>
<li>A sea elf hunting party has vanished during what was supposed to be a
 routine outing. The elves' mutilated bodies washed up in the port 
nearest the island. The sea elves (and their land-dwelling cousins) are 
outraged and demand that the culprit or culprits be found and punished. 
Because the hunters were stabbed, not bitten, the sea elves suspect 
land-dwelling fishermen, but they concede that sahuagin might be behind 
the attack. It's up to the PCs to determine what really happened.<br><br>
 The sea elves stumbled on Kroodrax as he was returning from an "errand"
 ashore, and one of them recognized him as a greenspawn sneak. Kroodrax 
killed the sea elves but could not hide the bodies before the tide swept
 them away.<br><br></li>
<li>Smugglers have been unusually active and successful all along the 
coast lately. Officials suspect that they might be posing as fishermen, 
or be getting help evading the authorities from dishonest fishermen. The
 sudden population boom on Fishermen's Island makes it a likely base of 
operations for smugglers, and the PCs are sent in to check it out.<br><br>
 Kroodrax has nothing to do with smuggling, though he's up to no good 
and he has plenty to hide. When the PCs begin poking around the island, 
Kroodrax pretends to cooperate, but he'll attack if they discover the 
shrine or act suspiciously toward him. It's also possible that Kroodrax 
knows who the local smugglers are. If so, he'll happily identify them 
for the PCs, hoping to allay any suspicions they might harbor for him.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Island (EL 3-8)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The island covers about fifteen acres. Of that, about a 
third is beach and mudflats and the remainder is equally divided between
 marshes infested with insects and rocky outcrops wreathed in scraggly 
trees.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The island's lizardfolk live in crude huts set on stilts
 over the marsh. The stilts keep the huts from flooding during storms or
 high tides. The other residents have built shacks and lean-tos in the 
rocky areas.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The following text shows how the island might look when viewed from the water at the height of the fishing season.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">Broad shallows dotted with several tiny islets surround a
 low island. Wide, muddy beaches slope gently from the surf and run 
inland for perhaps a bowshot before giving way to fields of marsh grass.
 A few rocky outcroppings cloaked with small trees rise here and there 
from the marsh.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An assortment of disreputable-looking fishing boats lies
 on the beach, and grass huts on stilts sit above the marsh just inland 
from the beach. The breeze carries the scents of woodsmoke and drying 
fish.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs encounter Kroodrax while he is out in his 
boat, he pretends to be a simple fisherman of whatever race he is using 
for his disguise that day. He stays reasonably close to the shoreline, 
within hailing distance.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">A rather tall halfling dressed in trousers cut off at 
the knee and a loose shirt hauls a net bursting with fish up into a 
small fishing boat. "Good mornin' t'ye, masters," he says, wiping his 
brow with a dirty cloth. "Th' sea 'as been good to us this mornin'," he 
says, bending to unclasp the net and starting to sort through the 
wriggling, silvery mass. He tosses the smallest fish back into the sea 
and sorts the larger ones into large buckets. "Would ye care to buy some
 fish fer yer breakfast? Th' snapper is fine today. Or maybe a nice 
catfish? Or ye could go over to th' island an' talk to ol' Gerphat. I 
bet he has a nice lobster or two in his traps."</p>
<p align="LEFT">The halfling holds up a wriggling fish. "People don't 
understand fish," he says conversationally. "They think they're cold an'
 ugly an' dumb. But look at that," he says, running a finger along the 
fish's topfin. "Those fine scales, shining in the sun like a hoard o' 
silver. Fish're almost as beautiful an' graceful as dragons -- though 
not as smart. Have ye ever seen a dragon, wingin' its way through the 
clouds, the sun glintin' off its scales? Sharks o' th' skies, I've heard
 'em called. I haven't never seen one -- but I hear tell adventurers see
 'em all th' time. Ah, must be quite th' life. Me, I'm happy enough just
 livin' 'ere an' singin' to my fish.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"That's th' best way to catch 'em, y'know," he continues
 with a grin. "Ye sit an' sing to 'em -- sing about heroes an' fools, 
an' dragons an' knights, an' b'fore y'know it, they're a-swimmin' into 
yer nets jus' so's they kin hear more. Cause when yer a fish, ye don't 
have much chance fer adventure, an' they crave it as much as anybody," 
he says with a wink.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Kroodrax continues to regale the PCs with strange fish 
tales and odd advice in hopes of figuring out their business here. He 
offers to show them around the island or direct them to where they need 
to go if they tell him what they seek.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There isn't much to see on the island beyond what's 
described above. Kroodrax and his servants have excavated a chamber 
under one of the rocky outcrops (one where nobody has built a house). 
This has filled with brackish water. Kroodrax claims the chamber is for 
storing live fish for bait or later sale in town. The islanders do store
 fish here, but only Kroodrax and his allies know that a tunnel leading 
out of the basin leads to a deeper chamber where Kroodrax has set up a 
shrine to Tiamat. The shrine chamber is underground but above the 
waterline. Kroodrax keeps the loot from his forays in the shrine, and he
 has accumulated a level 5 treasure (no magic items) in there.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures: </b>The island's inhabitants vary over 
time, but Kroodrax and his six lizardfolk servants are permanent 
residents, along with an additional dozen lizardfolk of various ages and
 a dozen commoners of various races. At least three of Kroodrax's 
lizardfolk are on the island at any given time to keep an eye on things.
 Kroodrax might also have other servants or guards, as suggested below.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lizardfolk (3-6):</b> hp 11 each; <i>MM</i> 169.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>Each lizardfolk keeps a pair of clubs 
and three javelins at hand. In a battle, they prefer to close in and 
gang up on a single foe, attacking with their clubs and teeth. If the 
tide of battle turns against them, they withdraw to the shrine for their
 final stand, tossing their javelins and clubs to discourage pursuit.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Monitor Lizards (1-2):</b> hp 22 each; <i>MM</i> 275.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>The lizards move toward the closest foes
 and attack. If their opponents withdraw, the lizards most likely stay 
behind to consume the fallen, friend and foe alike.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Scrags (1-2):</b> hp 63 each; <i>MM</i> 247.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>Kroodrax recruited these creatures to 
guard the shrine. They aren't likely to emerge from their lair except at
 night or when Kroodrax orders them forth, but they attack any stranger 
who enters the place. When fighting in the water, they love to swim past
 the foe's front rank and attack a vulnerable foe.</p>

 Kroodrax does his best to bring his devastating sneak attack power into
 play. He prefers to ambush foes, and if player characters come looking 
for him, he is likely to allow his lizardfolk to greet the interlopers 
while hiding nearby, awaiting a chance to attack with surprise. Once a 
battle begins, Kroodrax uses his Tumble skill, or a <i>potion of invisibility</i>
 if necessary, to get into position for more sneak attacks. Although a 
proficient swimmer, Kroodrax dislikes fighting in the water and will do 
so only if he must to keep vital allies, such as the scrags, in the 
fray.</p>
