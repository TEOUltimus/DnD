<p align="left">Many gardeners take pride in growing lush plants with 
big fruits or blossoms, but this garden has fantastically big fruits and
 vegetables. Sunflowers with blossoms bigger than washtubs, pea pods 
bigger than a human's forearm, and cabbages the size of beer barrels are
 just a few of the wonders growing within this garden. Is this place the
 work of some giant? Or is another force at work here?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The gardener who has produced such immense plants is 
Lonijan, a storm giant druid who has spent decades breeding common 
garden plants for increased size. He has succeeded admirably, though not
 necessarily extravagantly. Lonijan might have begun his project with 
seed stocks from normal (that is, human-scale) plants, or he might have 
gotten a head start with massive seeds he acquired from other giants as 
appropriate for your campaign. In any case, Lonijan has a green thumb 
and he adores gardening. He's happiest when digging in the dirt or 
otherwise tending his plants.</p>
<p align="left">Lonijan has had some success trading his produce and his
 seeds to other giant gardeners -- mostly other storm giants and good 
cloud giants. For a time, Lonijan worked to impress evil giants with the
 advantages of self-sufficient living (as opposed to raiding), and he 
has succeeded once or twice. Evil-minded giants who learn the art of 
gardening usually use their gardens to support more raiding, however, 
and Lonijan mostly has given up trying to teach evil giants anything. 
Occasionally, Lonijan shares seeds and ideas with a human, elf, or other
 humanoid gardener, though Lonijan's plants have never been more than 
curiosities in humanoid gardens. Their sheer size makes tending them a 
backbreaking chore for Medium creatures. They also require deep soil and
 massive amounts of water -- altogether too much for anyone but an 
actual giant to manage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">Lonijan's garden is located in a sheltered mountain 
valley, though it also could be found on a secluded tropical island or 
in an area ringed with rugged hills. Thanks to Lonijan's ability to 
control the weather, however, the garden might be located just about 
anywhere except an arctic clime.</p>
<p align="left">Though the garden lies well off the beaten track, the 
towering plants in it are visible from a considerable distance, and 
player characters might notice the place when traveling through the 
adjacent high ground or when flying over the area. Player characters 
also might visit the place with a specific errand in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs visit a small town or village where the local produce market
 features enormous vegetables. Or perhaps a gardener has managed to grow
 a sunflower or beanstalk as tall as a church steeple.<br><br> The 
locals have obtained some of Lonijan's seeds, either from Lonijan 
himself or indirectly through other gardeners who have access to his 
stocks. If the PCs inquire about the massive vegetables, the farmers 
might prove evasive, perhaps claiming to have received a blessing from a
 passing druid (not altogether untrue) or that they discovered a trove 
of "magic" seeds. If the PCs investigate further, they eventually learn 
about Lonijan and his gigantic garden. The locals tell the PCs that the 
friendly giant will gladly let peaceful visitors tour his garden (which 
is true).<br><br></li>
<li> A druid or other aficionado of growing things hires the PCs to 
deliver a package to Lonijan and to return with a similar package from 
the giant.<br><br> The PCs' employer might or might not tell the PCs 
that they are to visit a giant (the employer might simply refer to 
Lonijan as a colleague). The return package might contain seeds (which 
are fairly easy to carry), or a few seedlings (which require much more 
careful handling). Perhaps a red dragon living nearby gets wind of the 
PCs' mission and decides it must have the package they carry because it 
likely contains a valuable treasure.<br><br></li>
<li> The PCs encounter a confidence man who claims to have magic seeds 
for sale. He claims that planting the seeds will produce wonderful 
things, such as masterwork equipment or even minor magic items. The 
trickster shows the PCs a massive seedling as proof of his wares' 
potency.<br><br> The confidence man has a few of Lonijan's seeds, which are entirely nonmagical, though perhaps they have been treated with <i>Nystal's magic aura</i>
 spells. They produce nothing but very big vegetables, and then only if 
properly tended. PCs who encounter this scheme can eventually track the 
gigantic seeds back to a shipment that Lonijan lost in transit some time
 ago.<br><br></li>
<li> A fearsome monster has demanded an unusual tribute -- in the form 
of all the fruit and vegetables it can eat in a year. Unfortunately a 
drought or blight has wiped out the local supplies, and the folks who 
must provide the tribute turn to the PCs for help making up for lost 
time.<br><br> The creature making the demand might be something evil and
 vile, such as a red or green dragon (albeit one with unusual tastes) or
 perhaps a beholder trying to keep an army of slaves fed. Alternatively,
 the creature might prove benign, and the demand for vegetable tribute 
might be whimsical or made simply to save face. No matter who demands 
the fruit and vegetables, Lonijan's massive produce would make up for 
the shortage nicely.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Garden</b></p>
<p align="left">The garden's appearance doesn't change much with the seasons. Even if it's located in a temperate area, Lonijan's daily<i> control weather</i>
 spells allow the garden to produce year round. Lonijan takes advantage 
of this benefit by carefully planting his crops in succession, so that 
something is always producing fruit or blossoms.</p>
<p align="left">The text below assumes that the garden is located in a 
deep mountain valley, and that the PCs first notice the garden at a 
distance on a bright summer day. A few adjustments will be necessary if 
the characters come upon the garden suddenly or find it in different 
terrain.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The forest in the valley below abruptly gives way to a 
patch of vibrant color. A stand of trees seems crowned in brilliant 
yellow. Oddly enough, these trees stand in orderly rows, like soldiers 
on parade.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Rows of brilliant sunflowers, each taller than a castle 
guard tower , stand sentry over a garden full of equally gigantic 
plants. Beans and peas with vines thicker than a human's thigh climb 
trellises made from whole trees. Strawberry plants with leaves the size 
of tower shields and berries the size of wineskins sprawl for acres. A 
thicket of sweet-smelling roses with massive blooms and dagger-sized 
thorns ring the whole plot.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>Lonijan doesn't care to fight with 
anyone, but he'll attack anyone who tries to harm him, his garden, or 
Aneurin. Lonijan is fairly good at sizing up foes, and he usually can 
tell when someone doesn't pose much of a threat. In such cases, he wades
 in with his quarterstaff, striking to deal nonlethal damage (and taking
 a -4 penalty on attack rolls).</p>
<p align="left">Against anyone he sees as a threat, Lonijan retreats long enough to cast <i>barkskin</i> and <i>greater magic fang </i>on Aneurin, then looses <i>chain lighting</i>
 while Aneurin maneuvers to attack from the rear. The eagle attacks as 
Lonijan directs, usually swooping in to harry enemy spellcasters. After 
setting Aneurin on a foe, Lonijan moves in to make lethal attacks with 
his quarterstaff.</p>
<p align="left">Whether attacking to subdue or to kill, Lonijan might 
also use his Awesome Blow against foes who have damaged him in battle. 
If he must deal with foes spread over a wide area, Lonijan uses<i> call lightning</i> or empowered <i>produce flame</i> to damage foes beyond his melee reach (though he is always careful not to strike Aneurin).</p>
<p align="left">If he has time to prepare for a fight ahead of time, Lonijan uses <i>control weather</i> to create a storm before he casts <i>barkskin</i> and <i>greater magic fang </i>on Aneurin. He also casts <i>resist energy</i> on himself and Aneurin.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Meeting Lonijan</b></p>
<p align="left">If the PCs approach peacefully, they find Lonijan either
 working in his garden or inside his cave. In the former case, he is 
busy weeding and hoeing his rows of vegetables.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The sound of repeated blows punctuates the air, but no 
cries of pain accompany them. "Take that! And that!" bellows a voice 
that sounds like the roar of thunder on the wind. "Your kind has no

you!" Green, leafy vines fly into the air and fall again in a shower of 
dirt.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Lonijan has become frustrated with the weeds that seem 
to overtake his garden on a regular basis, and living alone as he does, 
he has taken to yelling at them as he breaks them up with his hoe.</p>
<p align="left">If approached in either his garden or his cave, Lonijan 
assumes that the PCs are children who have sought him out in response to
 some of the fanciful tales that circulate through the nearby 
settlements. All human-sized people look small to him, and he has been 
bothered by several groups of youngsters lately.</p>

increase size without compromising flavor, coupled with careful tending 
and good soil conditioning. Well, maybe there's a little magic in there 
too. But those seeds aren't toys, so stop breaking off the seedheads! 
And don't you dare try to climb my beanstalks. You break off the leaves 
when you do that." The giant returns to his work, still muttering to 
himself. "Dratted human kids! What imaginations! If I ever get my hands 
on that Jack again, I'll. . . ."</p>

<p align="left"><b>Inside the Garden</b></p>
<p align="left">Lonijan is happy to show visitors his garden anytime 
(once they assure him they're not silly kids). Overall, the place is 
neat and tidy, with long, straight rows of thriving plants and a deep 
layer of mulch underfoot. Characters touring the place in Lonijan's 
company are perfectly safe. The garden, however, fills three square 
miles -- more than enough space to hide some areas that a casual tour 
doesn't include. These are described below:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ant Gangs (EL 3-6)</b></p>
<p align="left">Giant ants have invaded the garden in force, and gangs 
of workers and soldiers are busy in several places. Lonijan appreciates 
the danger these creatures pose to visitors smaller than himself, so he 
steers visitors clear of the areas they infest. Anyone prowling around 
the garden on his own, however, might just stumble on a gang of workers 
or soldiers.</p>
<p align="left">The ants don't pose a threat to the garden, but some 
kinds of ants farm aphids (in this case, aphids the size of halflings). 
If this is so, Lonijan will want them controlled or driven out, and he 
might ask the PCs to help out by dealing with the ants and soldiers. 
Lonijan will handle the aphids, which don't pose a threat to anything 
except growing plants.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Giant Ant Workers (2-6): </b>hp 9 each; <i>MM</i> 284.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Giant Ant Soldiers (2-4): </b>hp 11 each; <i>MM</i> 284.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Workers tend to ignore other creatures 
and proceed with their tasks (which seem random and pointless to most 
other creatures). An attack against any worker, however, causes all of 
them to turn and attack the nearest foe.</p>
<p align="left">Soldiers are aggressive and attack any creatures they meet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Anthill (EL 2-8)</b></p>
<p align="left">The only way to permanently end the giant ant 
infestation is to locate their lair and kill the queen. The lair is a 
hill some 12 feet high with tunnels and chambers that extend 30 feet 
below the crest of the hill. The whole complex contains ten chambers, 
nine of which hold gangs of workers or solders (see previous encounter).
 The final chamber contains the queen, six workers, and four soldiers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Giant Ant Queen: </b>hp 22; <i>MM</i> 284.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The ants in here move toward any intruders and attack the closest foes. The workers stay near the queen.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ankheg Tunnels (EL 5-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">A cluster of ankhegs has moved into the garden. Lonijan 
considers them beneficial because they occasionally eat giant ants and 
other interlopers. They also have a bad habit of using their acid 
attacks whenever Lonijan ventures too close. Lonijan won't be too sad to
 see them go, especially if the giant ant queen has been eliminated.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ankhegs (2-4): </b>hp 28 each; <i>MM</i> 14.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The ankhegs lie under the mulch and 
attack anything that comes within reach. They're accustomed to loosing 
their acid attacks at the start of any battle.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hieracosphinx Nests (EL 7-11)</b></p>
<p align="left">These creatures have recently flown in during a 
far-ranging search for a gynosphinx. Lonijan detests their evil natures.
 He also fears that they are a threat to Aneurin and has plans to remove
 them. He's happy to pass that job on to the PCs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hieracosphinxes (2-7): </b>hp 67 each; <i>MM</i> 234.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The sphinxes spend most of their time 
soaring above the garden. They avoid Lonijan but gladly swoop down and 
pounce on lesser creatures visiting the garden.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bulette Burrow (EL 7-9)</b></p>
<p align="left">A pair of bulettes has established a territory centered 
on the garden. They have created a lair in the soft garden soil; 
sometimes the burrow lies empty, and sometimes one or two bulettes are 
present, depending on how their hunting goes. Lonijan doesn't mind their
 presence, but he's getting fed up with their aggressive behavior and 
foul temper.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bulettes (1-2): </b>hp 94 each; <i>MM</i> 30.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> A lone bulette lies in the burrow and 
uses its tremorsense to note intruders. When it detects prey, it burrows
 into the middle of an approaching group and attacks the character who 
is unfortunate enough to be within reach when it breaks the surface.</p>
<p align="left">Two bulettes use a similar approach, except that they hit a group's front and rear simultaneously.</p>
