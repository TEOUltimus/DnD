<p align="left">The broken shell of an ancient tower stands, forlorn and
 forgotten, on a hilltop that rises from a trackless wilderness. The 
tower's once formidable gateway stands empty. A few bits of a portcullis
 remain in the dark opening, like rotted teeth in a corpse's mouth. 
Weeds and moss grow where sentries once walked.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The tower stands on a hill located on the fringes of a 
civilized area. It is at least a hundred miles to the nearest city, and 
it is more than 20 miles to the nearest village. The tower once served 
as a border fort, but boundaries have shifted since then. A small 
settlement that the residents called Fryeburg (after the tower's first 
commander) nestled nearby, but the people abandoned the settlement when 
the garrison withdrew. Today, nothing remains of the settlement except 
for a lidless well, and a few hearthstones and cornerstones lost in the 
weeds. The wattle and daub huts and wooden cottages the settlers built 
had dirt floors for the most part, and they possessed no foundations to 
speak of. The tower still stands on its hill, but it is merely a 
roofless shell.</p>
<p align="left">In spite of (or because of) its dilapidated condition 
and isolated location, the tower might provide an appealing home for any
 number of creatures. For many years, one Pandirus, a half-fiend elf, 
called the place home. Pandirus was an eccentric scholar and inveterate 
collector of anything and everything. He had a bad habit of never 
throwing anything away. Objects that no longer held his interest wound 
up on the tower floor, and over the decades, Pandirus built up a 
veritable mountain of junk. Treasure seekers who came to the tower 
looking for a fabulous treasure rumored to be hidden underneath it made 
heroic efforts to clear out the junk and explore the tower's dungeons, 
but the pile's sheer mass invariably defeated them.</p>
<p align="left">Pandirus did little to discourage these treasure quests,
 since he didn't care at all what happened to his discarded junk. Often,
 he was away collecting more bric-a-brac and thus absent when the 
treasure hunters were at work. Whenever he returned to find junk strewn 
over the hillside, he'd merely toss it all back into the tower.</p>
<p align="left">Pandirus might be long gone when the PCs arrive on the 
scene (perhaps his bones lie mingled with his discarded junk), or he 
could still be dwelling in the ruined tower. Even if Pandirus is gone, 
several gargoyles (once Pandirus's attendants) still make their home 
here.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs might hear any number of rumors that could draw them to tower, and some of them might even be true.</p>
<ul>
<li> The area around the ruined tower is deserted because the tower 
itself marks a gateway to the lower planes. Periodically, hordes of 
fiends issue from its depths and spread out over the countryside, 
killing and maiming to satisfy their lust for violence and blood.<br><br>
 A gateway to another plane could be in the tower (most likely something
 Pandirus created to expand his ability to collect things). Treat such 
an area as a <i>gate</i> effect that works a maximum of once per month 
if the user has the proper triggering item (most likely something like a
 magnifying glass or history book). If your campaign is set in the <b>Forgotten Realms,</b> this is a standard portal, as described in Chapter 2 of the <i>Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting.</i> It functions once a month and requires a key, as noted above.<br><br>
 The reference to "hordes of fiends" reflects various sightings of 
Pandirus over the years and to the gargoyles that call the tower home 
now.<br><br></li>
<li>The tower once served as the abode of a great wizard who held sway 
over many elementals and fiends. The wizard disappeared long ago, but 
his valet, a bizarre and hideous creature with fiendish blood, still 
guards the tower and seeks to slay all trespassers. A village once stood
 near the tower, but in the wizard's absence, the valet slew every 
villager who did not flee.<br><br> This one is pretty much false. The 
references to the wizard and fiendish valet both reflect a distorted 
memory of Pandirus. Tales of mass murder in the area could be mere 
fabrication, or they could refer to the gargoyles' activities.<br><br></li>
<li>The lord of the tower once found a fabulous treasure, which still 
lies in a hidden vault. An ancient curse on the treasure wiped out the 
lord's family; however, the curse will be broken if the people who find 
it carry it on their heads and walk backwards around a temple three 
times while chanting a prayer for protection.<br><br> Indeed, a treasure
 might be hidden in the tower. The treasure could be a collection of 
trinkets and coins that Pandirus stashed away and then forgot about, or 
the tower gargoyles might have collected it. The curse is most likely a 
fanciful invention, but if you can get your PCs to do something really 
silly to avoid it, go for it.<br><br></li>
<li> The real treasure of the tower lies in its well. Water dipped from 
it in a silver ewer during the dark of the moon can cure any ill.<br><br>
 This refers to the well inside the tower (see Visiting the Tower). The 
rumor could be true. If so, one must draw water from the well with a 
silver vessel, and nothing but the silver must touch the water. A 
character can accomplish this by tying a cord to a silver vessel with a 
handle and dipping the vessel into the well. It takes a DC 15 Dexterity 
check to draw out any water without dipping in the cord or knocking 
loose something from the well shaft. Successfully drawn water has the 
effect of a <i>heal</i> spell, but it remains potent for only 10 
minutes, and only the first creature to drink from the silver vessel 
gets any special benefit. It's a good bet that some creature is on hand 
when the well is active.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>About Pandirus</b></p>
<p align="left">Pandirus is distantly related to Artemus Frye, the last 
steward of the tower. His mortal mother was an elf conjurer. Always 
intensely curious and precocious, Pandirus learned to read about the 
same time as he learned to walk, and soon he was studying magic, 
history, and geography all at the same time. Though volatile and self 
centered, Pandirus has never been an evil being; his passion for 
bric-a-brac and obscure facts has overwhelmed his basic nature. 
Nevertheless, he's a completely amoral being prone to give in to 
whatever urges happen to strike him at any given moment. When he meets 
the PCs, he's very likely to question them at length about some item one
 of them carries. He is prone to violent rages, especially when 
contradicted.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> In a fight, Pandirus relies on his gargoyle bodyguards for protection.

Pandirus usually takes to the air while fighting. His first offensive spell usually is <i>confusion. </i>After that, he uses <i>magic missile, shout,</i> and <i>Melf's acid arrow.</i> When he runs out of offensive spells, he uses his wands. If he feels the need, he uses <i>blink</i> to defend himself and <i>dimension door</i> to escape.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Tower</b></p>
<p align="left">Knee-high grass, patches of brambles, and a few scraggly
 trees cover the hill where the tower stands. The ruined tower crowns 
the hill. Characters can find several areas to explore.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Village Ruins</b></p>
<p align="left">The village covered the hill's lower slopes and 
completely ringed the tower. Today, nothing sticks up out of the grass 
and brambles except for a few wild fruit trees that have sprouted from 
the remains of the village orchards. Characters poking through the weeds
 can find a few stones here and there (cornerstones, hearthstones, and 
thresholds) where huts and cottages once stood. They also might stumble 
on the old well, which weeds and vines completely conceal. Unwary 
characters might fall into the well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Old Well: </b>CR 3; mechanical; location trigger; 
manual reset; DC 16 Reflex save avoids; 60 ft. deep (6d6, fall); one 
target; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price: </i>4,300 gp.</p>
<p align="left">The well shaft is blocked 60 feet down, so characters 
who fall in aren't at risk for drowning. The shaft also is fairly 
narrow. Huge or larger creatures cannot fall into the shaft. A Large or 
Medium creature that falls in can attempt a DC 20 Climb checks after 
falling 1d4 x 10 feet. A successful check allows a character to grip the
 wall and stop falling. The character still takes 1d6 points of 
nonlethal damage for every 10 feet fallen. A character who falls all the
 way to the bottom takes 6d6 points of damage and may become buried.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Well Bottom: </b>CR 3; mechanical; location trigger; 
manual reset; DC 16 Reflex save avoids; pinned at the bottom if the save
 fails; Search DC 20; Disable Device DC 20. <i>Market Price: </i>1,500 gp.</p>
<p align="left">A creature striking the bottom of the well shaft must 
make a DC 16 Reflex save or become buried there. (The character plunges 
into loose, rocky material at the bottom of the shaft and more debris 
falls on top of the character.) A trapped character takes 1d6 points of 
nonlethal damage per minute. If a trapped character falls unconscious, 
he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of 
lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. A trapped 
character is pinned in place and must be rescued. A trapped character 
lies beneath 4d6 feet of material. A rescuer digging into the mass makes
 a Strength check for every minute of digging, and clears away 1 foot of
 debris for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. A 
creature with a burrowing speed can free the trapped victim with a move 
action. The space at the bottom of the shaft is about 2 1/2 feet across,
 just wide enough for a Small or Medium creature to squeeze in.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tower Entrance</b></p>
<p align="left">The tower stands atop a 70-foot hill. A flight of 
shallow, weed-covered stone steps winds up the hillside to the tower's 
only ground-level entrance. The stairs follow the only route up the hill
 that does not require a Climb check to use, but movement up the stairs 
is hampered because of the slope. Scaling the hill by another route 
requires a DC 10 Climb check. </p>
<p align="left">Originally, the main tower had a wide arch with an outer
 portcullis and a pair of ironbound inner doors. A small flanking tower 
still stands next to the entrance. Arrow slits in the flanking tower and
 a battlement at its top protected the entrance. Attackers moving up the
 stairs must cross back and forth in front of the flanking tower.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 7-9):</b> A few gargoyles lurk near the
 entrance. They have made the tower their lair. If Pandirus is still in 
residence, the gargoyles serve as his bodyguards and companions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gargoyles</b><b>(3-5);</b> hp 37 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 113.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The gargoyles spend most of their time 
sitting as still as statues (and they're very good at it). Although it 
is difficult to tell a motionless gargoyle from a statue, these 
gargoyles know that it is best not to be seen at all. They remain hidden
 behind the many arrow slits in the flanking tower and around the 
gateway. They have knocked out the stonework in the slits and then piled
 up the stones again, so that when they spot intruders they can burst 
out to attack. A DC 20 Spot check reveals the unusual stonework.</p>
<p align="left">The gargoyles are canny enough to use their flying speed
 to stay away from the party's more formidable fighters, and they 
concentrate their attacks on more vulnerable characters.</p>
<p align="left">Any gargoyle reduced to 10 or fewer hit points withdraws from combat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Development:</b> If Pandirus still resides here, the 
gargoyles tend to stay hidden and observe the PCs while one of their 
number alerts Pandirus. If possible, the gargoyles refrain from 
attacking until Pandirus is ready to fight, and Pandirus probably will 
want to talk to the PCs first.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs spot the gargoyles, they attack, and Pandirus
 becomes aware of the PCs at the same time the gargoyles do. Pandirus 
joins any fight that starts out here as soon as he completes his 
preparations.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tower Interior</b></p>
<p align="left">All that remains inside the main tower is a single 
chamber open to the sky. A vast pile made up of a staggering array of 
rotting and rusting junk fills most of the floor. Pandirus collected and
 discarded these items over several centuries of studying and 
collecting.</p>
<p align="left">A casual look reveals old weapons and armor (mostly 
broken or corroded beyond usefulness), wrecked farm implements, a vast 
array of hand tools, broken vases and pots, moldering baskets, assorted 
clothing (thick with mildew), bits and pieces of statuary, old barrels 
and casks, and even a cracked mirror or two. A determined excavation 
might unearth a few items that are actually worth something, but doing 
so requires at least a day's work and a few DC 20 Appraise checks. The 
total value of items recovered should not exceed a few hundred gold 
pieces.</p>
<p align="left">In the flanking tower is a stairwell leading up to the 
loft and down to the tower dungeons. The upper stairs remain clear, but 
the same sort of junk that fills the tower floor blocks the lower 
stairwell. It would take several days' work to clear the stairs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tower Dungeons</b></p>
<p align="left">These dank chambers include cells, storage areas, and a 
chamber that houses the tower's well. If you've decided that the rumor 
about the miraculous well is true, this is it.</p>
<p align="left">A treasure could be hidden down here; if so, it is hidden under a floor somewhere.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Loft</b></p>
<p align="left">This chamber atop the flanking tower serves (or served) 
as Pandirus's bedchamber, study, and library. If Pandirus no longer 
resides here, the whole place feels clammy and damp. A slimy layer of 
dirt and fungi covers everything, and the furnishings and books are so 
rotten they fall apart when touched.</p>
<p align="left">If the tower contains a treasure, it might be hidden 
here instead of in the dungeons. It could be hidden in one of the walls,
 or perhaps it is hidden in plain sight in the form of Pandirus's books 
and specimens.</p>
<p align="left">If Pandirus still lives here, all is in appalling 
disarray, but the furnishings and Pandirus's vast array of books (many 
written in his own hand) are intact, along with a sizable collection of 
items that Pandirus is currently examining.</p>
<p align="left">When Pandirus realizes that he has company, he assumes 
the PCs are some sort of couriers delivering an item that he ordered 
from a far-off dealer. Thus, he greets them more or less as follows.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Here now, what are you nosing around there for? The 
door's right over here. Well go ahead, bring it in! Oh, I've been 
waiting for that thropwickle for an age! Nothing but delays -- you'd 
think no one made them anymore. I remember the one my mother had -- of 
course that was a very primitive model, but it did the job. I can't wait
 to see the improvements they've made since then. Well don't just stand 
there! Let me see the merchandise!"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"> Pandirus looks quite disappointed when he discovers 
that the PCs have not come to bring him his thropwickle (which could be 
anything from an obscure article of clothing to a local name for a pot 
handle, at the DM's discretion). If the characters seem inclined to 
talk, he grudgingly makes them as comfortable as possible in his 
chambers. Should they admit to being adventurers, his interest is 
renewed, since he thinks they might have come across some unusual items 
in their travels.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"So tell me," says Pandirus, "what have you found in 
your travels? Anything of interest to a collector of the unusual? The 
scarf that Alira the Beautiful wore when she was married to Brusk the 
Barbarian? The mask that General Hathorne wore to the costume ball given
 by the Marchesa of Pendilthi? Surely you must have uncovered something 
of historical note."</p>

<p align="left">The PCs can sell Pandirus any piece of junk they wish, 
so long as they can spin a yarn about its history, but doing so requires
 a Bluff check opposed by Pandirus's Sense Motive check. Pandirus pays 
anywhere from the item's normal market price up to two or three times 
that amount. If he detects the PCs trying to con him, he pretends to 
accept the item on offer and steps away, ostensibly to get money for the
 purchase, but really to prepare for a fight (he hates being conned). 
Even if the PCs foist some junk on him, Pandirus diligently researches 
whatever item he has bought and quickly uncovers the scam. He'll be 
spoiling for a fight if the PCs even return to the tower -- he might 
even hunt them down and try to kill them.</p>
