<p align="left">The old mill is missing a few slates from the roof, and 
its stone walls have grown fuzzy with moss. Still, the waterwheel turns 
with a steady swish and creak. Willows and rushes line the millpond, 
creating a sense of benign neglect and rural charm. But, is all as it 
seems?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2001-16%20-%20The%20Old%20Gristmill_files/VV_011604_med_h3s9h92.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="192" width="210">The
 mill has stood for three generations. When originally built, it stood 
in a frontier area where an ambitious young overlord, one Symone 
Huclogh, was pushing out the borders of civilization and inviting 
commoners to occupy the newly cleared land (and become Symone's tenants 
and subjects). The new mill served multiple functions. Of course, it 
ground flour from the grain the locals grew. In this role, it also 
served as a source of revenue for Symone, who declared a monopoly of 
gristmills in the area. Symone received a share of all flour produced by
 the mill.</p>
<p align="left">The mill, with its formidable stone walls and riverside 
location, also served as a strongpoint for the area's defense. In times 
of danger, folks who couldn't reach the safety of Symone Huclogh's 
castle could take refuge at the mill instead.</p>
<p align="left">All went well for many years, and the area boomed. The 
mill stayed busy year round as nearby farmers took to stockpiling their 
grain and having it milled into flour as needed. The good time ended 
abruptly, however, when disastrous floods struck the area thirty years 
ago. The river on which the mill stood inexorably rose and burst its 
banks, wiping out once thriving riverside villages in a matter of hours.
 Croplands, carefully tilled for generations, flooded out and were 
converted in one storm-lashed night to sterile mudflats choked with 
debris. Bridges and roads washed out as well, but the mill, which had 
been built for strength, remained.</p>
<p align="left">The area has not fully recovered from that disastrous 
night thirty years ago. Only a handful of hardy souls remain. The 
survivors have wisely moved to higher ground, but many still work to 
recover flood-damaged fields closer to the river. The mill still grinds 
grain, but only at a fraction of its former rate, and it sits idle most 
days. The heirs of Symone Huclogh still have a monopoly on gristmills in
 the area, and the locals are obliged to take their grain to the mill 
for storage and processing. The situation does not make the current 
miller, a young man called Cyndelwoc, a popular fellow.</p>
<p align="left">Rumors, many of them unkind, about Cyndelwoc abound. He 
was born the summer after the disastrous flood. His mother, Ruxanna, was
 the miller's wife. The miller Clyve, and his oldest son, Bors died 
during the flood when they dove into the raging river to save someone 
being swept downstream. Neither the two men nor the person they tried to
 save were ever seen again. In the days and weeks after the flood, it 
was assumed that Ruxanna would remarry, and she attracted many suitors. 
Ruxanna spurned them all, however, working the mill herself with help 
from her two children, Bronwyn and little Clyve, and from a mysterious 
stranger who kept near the mill. Ruxanna and her helpers proved capable,
 but tongues soon wagged when Cyndelwoc came along. Ruxanna never 
revealed who Cyndelwoc's father was, but the mysterious stranger 
continued to live with the family, and the locals assumed he was 
Cyndelwoc's father. Eventually, Bronwyn and Clyve met and married two 
locals and both sets of couples left the area. Ever since Ruxanna's 
death a few years ago, Cyndelwoc has operated the mill on his own. The 
circumstances of Cyndelwoc's birth haven't helped his popularity with 
his customers and neighbors.</p>
<p align="left">Cyndelwoc's father was indeed the mysterious stranger 
from the mill. The night of the flood, Dajuun, who is a nixie, and a few
 close friends recklessly ventured into the river to ride the wild 
currents. The group was soon scattered, and Dajuun was swept down the 
river and into the millrace (an artificial channel that carries water to
 power the mill's waterwheel). Though Dajuun was in no danger of 
drowning, debris from the flood threatened to batter him to death. It 
was Dajuun that Clyve and Bors tried to save. The pair couldn't drag 
Dajuun out of the millrace, and all three eventually were swept over the
 mill's wildly spinning waterwheel and dumped into the overflowing pond 
below. All three were knocked unconscious, but Clyve and Bors drowned. 
The following morning, Ruxanna found the two bodies, and Dajuun.</p>
<p align="left">Ruxanna tended Dajuun's injuries as best she could and 
the nixie recovered in time. Dajuun was well aware that Ruxanna's 
husband and older son died to save him from a fate he had largely 
brought upon himself, and he resolved to help the family as well as he 
could. He became the family's helper and guardian, and soon deep 
affection developed between Ruxanna and Dajuun. He never revealed 
exactly how he came to be in the millpond where Clyve and Bors drowned.</p>
<p align="left">Cyndelwoc's half siblings, Bronwyn and little Clyve, 
never quite knew what to make of their mother and her lover, but they 
became very fond of their half brother. Cyndelwoc was a delightful 
child, though perhaps a tad too fond of the river to suit the human 
members of the family. It was quickly agreed that Cyndelwoc's true 
nature should remain a secret, and the family let it be known that 
Cyndelwoc was a half-elf. In time, Bronwyn and Clyve left home to start 
families of their own. After their mother's death, they both moved far 
away, so as to avoid too many questions about their half brother. 
Bronwyn and Clyve were happy to allow Cyndelwoc to remain behind and 
become the next miller; to their minds he always was a child of the 
river. Dajuun still dwells in the millpond, keeping watch over his son.</p>
<p align="left">Cyndelwoc spends most of his days avoiding contact with 
his neighbors and wandering up and down the river, fishing, swimming, 
and keeping a wary eye out for raiders from the wilderness that is 
slowly reclaiming the area. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs might discover the mill by merely passing by it 
one day. A fairly well-used road runs past the mill, and of course it 
stands on the river. Or, they might encounter Cyndelwoc on the river. 
It's also possible they might need Cyndelwoc's services, either as a 
miller (perhaps they need something ground up), but most likely as a 
tracker, guide, or boat pilot. Other possibilities include the 
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs hear rumors of a cache of freshwater pearls hidden in or 
near the mill. Perhaps Dajuun had several pearls with him when he was 
trapped at the mill, or perhaps Dajuun and Cyndelwoc have collected them
 over the years. Gifts of pearls might have enabled Bronwyn and Clyve to
 strike out on their own. Perhaps the overlord who controls the mill 
demands an even greater share of the profits than the locals know, and 
Cyndelwoc makes up the difference through the sale of a few pearls each 
year.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs are called upon to deal with monsters that menace the area 
where the mill is located. Cyndelwoc, or the area's overlord (or both) 
may offer the mill as a base of operations. The mill has served as 
strongpoint before, and it can do so again. The monsters could by 
anything from a tribe of orcs to a clutch of green dragons. It also may 
be a group of merrows, scrags, lacedons, kapoacinths, or some 
combination of these creatures has entered the river.<br><br></li>
<li>A conflict has broken out between the local farmers and various fey 
creatures living nearby. The PCs might be called upon to mediate, or 
they might simply be caught in the crossfire when they visit the area on
 business of their own. Dajuun and Cyndelwoc might be carefully neutral 
in this conflict, or they might be secretly allied with one side or the 
other. It's even possible that father and son favor different sides.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">No matter what the true situation, anyone asking questions about the mill or the miller is apt to get an earful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyndelwoc the miller? A creepy guy if you ask me. When you deal with
 him face to face, it's pretty hard to get mad at him, but it sure 
doesn't bother him to take the overlord's cut out of every bushel of 
grain he mills, or to skim off some for himself, neither!<br><br></li>
<li>As kids, we used to call Cyndelwoc "Cindi" for short. We thought it 
was pretty funny, but it didn't seem to bother him any. Now that he's 
the miller, he's getting his own back. I guess some folks can really 
carry a grudge.<br><br></li>
<li>They say the miller is a half-elf, but a half fish is more like it! 
No one knows who his father was really. And he sure likes the water. 
Goes swimming all the time. Look at his hands! They're webbed! It just 
isn't natural!</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>About Cyndelwoc</b></p>
<p align="left">Cyndelwoc is about 30 years old, which is still rather 
young for a half-fey. He stands 5 feet, 1 inch tall and has a very 
slight frame; he weighs 112 pounds. He has blue-green eyes and light 
blond hair with just a hint of green. He has webbed fingers and toes.</p>
<p align="left">Cyndelwoc does as well he can at the mill, and he bears 
the ill will he gets from his customers neighbors with fairly good 
humor. As noted earlier, Cyndelwoc likes to get away from the mill when 
he can, and that's fairly often. He usually leaves Dajuun to watch 
things while he's away, and sometimes he also leaves Galatea, his riding
 dog animal companion, for some extra security.</p>
<p align="left">He tends to greet strangers coolly, but politely, when near the mill. When out in the wild he acts more cheerful and friendly.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The half-fey template in the <i>Fiend Folio</i> 
specifies butterfly wings and a fly speed for all half-fey. Since 
Cyndelwoc is a half-nixie, he has webbed appendages and a swim speed 
instead.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc has a riding dog animal companion named Galatea. She gains the following benefits from her companion.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Link (Ex): </i>Cyndelwoc can handle Galatea as a free

ranks in the Handle Animal skill. Cyndelwoc gains a +4 circumstance 
bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks regarding her.
 </p>
<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex): </i>Cyndelwoc can have any spell 
(but not spell-like ability) he casts upon himself also affect Galatea 
if she is within 5 feet of him at the time of casting. If the spell has a
 duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting Galatea if she 
moves more than 5 feet away and does not affect her again even if she 
returns before the duration expires. Cyndelwoc can also cast a spell 
with a target of "You" on Galatea (as a touch range spell) instead of on
 himself. Cyndelwoc and Galatea can even share spells that do not

<p align="left"><b>Nature Sense (Ex):</b> Cyndelwoc gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks (already figured into the statistics above). </p>
<p align="left"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc can use body 
language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an 
animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to 
influence the attitude of a person, but Cyndelwoc's modifier to the die 
roll is +3. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of 
indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild 
empathy, Cyndelwoc must be able to study the animal and it him, so they 
must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally 
an attempt takes 1 minute. Cyndelwoc can also use this ability to 
influence the attitude of a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1
 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

Caster level 8th.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Animal Companion (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc has a riding dog animal companion named Galatea. She gains the following benefits from her companion.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Link (Ex): </i>Cyndelwoc can handle Galatea as a free
 action or push her as a move action, even though he doesn't have any 
ranks in the Handle Animal skill. Cyndelwoc gains a +4 circumstance 
bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks regarding her.
 </p>
<p align="left"><i>Share Spells (Ex): </i>Cyndelwoc can have any spell 
(but not spell-like ability) he casts upon himself also affect Galatea 
if she is within 5 feet of him at the time of casting. If the spell has a
 duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting Galatea if she 
moves more than 5 feet away and does not affect her again even if she 
returns before the duration expires. Cyndelwoc can also cast a spell 
with a target of "You" on Galatea (as a touch range spell) instead of on
 himself. Cyndelwoc and Galatea can even share spells that do not 
normally affect creatures of the animal type.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Nature Sense (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks (already figured into the statistics above). </p>
<p align="left"><b>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, nymphs, and sprites).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trackless Step (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. He can choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>Cyndelwoc can use body 
language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an 
animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to 
influence the attitude of a person, but Cyndelwoc's modifier to the die 
roll is +8. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of 
indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild 
empathy, Cyndelwoc must be able to study the animal and it him, so they 
must be within 30 feet of each other under normal conditions. Generally 
an attempt takes 1 minute. Cyndelwoc can also use this ability to 
influence the attitude of a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1
 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wild Shape (Su): </b>Twice a day, Cyndelwoc can turn 
himself into any Small or Medium animal and back again. His options for 
new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability 
functions like the <i>polymorph</i> spell, except as noted here. The 
effect lasts for 6 hours or until he changes back. Changing form (to 
animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of 
opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the Cyndelwoc is 
familiar with. Cyndelwoc loses his ability to speak while in animal form
 because he is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can
 make, but he can communicate normally with other animals of the same 
general grouping as his new form. The new form's Hit Dice cannot exceed 
6. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Woodland Stride (Ex):</b> Cyndelwoc can move through normal undergrowth at normal speed, but he is still hampered by magically manipulated undergrowth.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Druid Spells Prepared</b> (5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell level): 0 -- <i>cure minor wounds, detect magic, flare, light, resistance; </i>1st -- <i>endure elements, magic fang, produce flame, speak with animals; </i>2nd -- <i>barkskin, fog cloud, heat metal, summon swarm; </i>3rd -- <i>call lightning, greater magic fang, meld into stone.</i></p>

<p align="left"><i>Skills and Feats: </i>Jump +11, Listen +6, Spot +5, Survival +3, Swim +5; Alertness, Blind-Fight, Dodge, Track.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Devotion (Ex): </b>Galatea gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Evasion (Ex): </b>If Galatea is subjected to an 
attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she 
takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Scent (Ex):</b> The creature can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Three versions of Cyndelwoc and Galatea 
are presented here, all at different levels. At lower levels, Cyndelwoc 
tends to rely on his <i>charm person</i> ability in a fight. He targets the most aggressive and physically powerful foes first. If <i>charm person</i> proves ineffective, he usually calls Galatea to protect him while he uses <i>summon nature's ally</i> to conjure up some additional muscle.</p>
<p align="left">At higher levels, Cyndelwoc prepares for a fight by using <i>magic fang</i> on Galatea and <i>barkskin</i> on himself or Galatea when he can.</p>
<p align="left">At all levels, Cyndelwoc prefers making ranged attacks with his sling or with his <i>produce fire</i> spells rather than melee combat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Mill</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, the mill isn't in the best condition these days, but it still functions. It's a two-story stone building.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#D7D7D7" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#D7D7D7" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">A massive stone mill stands at a bend in the river, 
looking like a great, moss-covered rock. The lower walls look greener 
than the uncut grass growing around the place. Its steeply pitched roof 
seems to have lost some slates here and there, revealing weathered 
planks and even a few holes underneath. A thicket of willows and rushes 
hides most of the lower level, but there's a waterwheel just visible 
through the tangled shrubbery. It turns steadily, creaking and grumbling
 like an old man on a cold morning. Those mechanical sounds, however, 
seem barely audible over the noise of the falling water swishing over 
the wheel and splashing into the unseen millpond below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The mill is located where the river bends in a wide loop
 that nearly forms a closed circle. A small dam diverts water into the 
millrace on the upstream side of the loop, and from there the water 
flows over the mill's waterwheel and into the millpond below. Another 
artificial channel carries water from the millpond back to the river on 
the downstream side of the loop.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Mill Grounds</b></p>
<p align="left">The millrace, millpond, and drain channel forms an 
artificial island inside the loop in the river. The only land access to 
the "island" lies through the mill.</p>
<p align="left">The millrace and the channel that drains the pond are 
about 7 feet wide and just as deep. They both contain very fast moving 
water. It takes a DC 20 Swim or Strength check to cross, and the swimmer
 takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage even with a successful check. A 
failed check means the swimmer is swept way on the current. A swimmer 
upstream of the millpond takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and 4d6 
points of lethal damage as he goes over the waterwheel. (Dajuun was very
 lucky to survive his trip over the wheel.) A Reflex save (DC 15) 
reduces the damage by half. A swimmer downstream of the millpond takes 
2d6 points of nonlethal damage, and a Reflex save (DC 15) reduces the 
damage by half. Anyone who goes over the wheel is carried to the bottom 
of the millpond and trapped there for 1d6+2 minutes before a random eddy
 in the current sets him free. A creature can break loose on its own 
with a DC 35 Strength or Swim check.</p>
<p align="left">Jumping over either channel proves safer, but the willow
 thicket imposes a -10 penalty on Jump checks (the woodland stride class
 feature negates this penalty). Willows line the millpond and both sides
 of the millrace and drain channel in belts 10 feet thick. The willows 
are so dense it takes a move action just to push 5 feet through them. 
(Woodland stride allows normal movement through the willows.) The 
willows provide soft cover to anyone pushing through them.</p>
<p align="left">The millpond is roughly oval and is about 40 feet long 
and 25 feet wide. In the middle, it is more than 30 feet deep. The very 
deepest part of the pond has an artificial grotto made of rocks, water 
plants, and live shellfish taken from the river. (Some of the latter 
might contain freshwater pearls.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 1): </b>Dajuun makes his home in the 
grotto. A submerged tunnel near the grotto leads to the mill's ground 
floor and allows Dajuun to move between the pond and the mill without 
being seen.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dajuun (Nixie):</b> hp 3; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 235.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Mill Building</b></p>
<p align="left">The land side of the mill has two entrances. At ground 
level, a pair of double doors opens into a storage area. A short flight 
of stone steps leads up about 8 feet to a single door that leads into 
the chamber that contains the milling machinery. On the river side of 
the mill, there is a single door that opens onto a rickety wooden 
catwalk that runs along the mill's outer wall. One end of the catwalk 
leads to the water wheel, and the other leads to dry ground just beyond 
the millpond (on the river side of the mill), but the willows block this
 end.</p>
<p align="left">The mill has stone walls strong enough to withstand a 
siege, though there are several windows one might reach by climbing. 
Cyndelwoc keeps the doors locked and the windows shuttered and barred 
whenever he is away. He usually opens a window when at home, but he 
keeps the doors locked unless he is taking grain delivery or shipping 
out finished product.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Strong Wooden Doors:</b> 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 20; break DC 25; Open Lock DC 20.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shutters:</b> 1 1/2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 15; break DC 18.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Stone Walls:</b> 2 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 360; break DC 60; Climb DC 25.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inside the Mill </b></p>
<p align="left">The mill has a ground floor given over to storage and 
machinery, an upper floor with living quarters for the miller, and an 
attic.</p>
<p align="left">The ground floor has two chambers. The larger of the two
 holds sacks of milled flour, several huge bins full of whole grain, and
 a big scale for weighing goods. Cyndelwoc keeps a ledger here where he 
keeps track of all the grain and flour he handles. Entries show who 
delivered grain and when. Another column of entries shows when Cyndelwoc
 processed the grain, and the overlord's share of the resulting flour. 
In times of trouble, Cyndelwoc can pile several tons of grain and flour 
against the double doors leading outside, making it all but impossible 
to force them open.</p>
<p align="left">The second chamber on the ground floor contains the 
millstones and the collection for gears and shafts that connect them to 
the waterwheel. A layer of fine dust coats everything in here. A flight 
of stairs leads up from here to a landing that goes to the outside door,
 and thence up to the second floor. A water-filled hole in the floor 
connects the chamber to Dajuun's grotto at the bottom of the millpond 
(see the Mill Grounds section) via a submerged tunnel.</p>
<p align="left">The upper floor contains living quarters spacious enough
 for a big family, though Cyndelwoc has the place to himself now. 
There's a kitchen, living area, two big bedrooms, and a large, walk-in 
pantry.</p>
<p align="left">The kitchen has a massive fireplace with a brick oven. 
There's also a rickety table and two battered chairs. The kitchen has 
ample storage space, but the cupboards are mostly empty; Cyndelwoc and 
Dajuun don't cook much, and Cyndelwoc's half-siblings took away their 
share of the household goods when they left. The rest of the living 
quarters are similarly bare. Cyndelwoc sleeps on a cot in the living 
area. He has a trunk for his personal belongings, but no other 
furniture. A pile of old flour sacks heaped near the cot serves as a bed
 for Galatea.</p>
<p align="left">The bedrooms have bed frames, but no mattresses or 
bedclothes. The pantry has a small supply of flour and dried fish, but 
little else. A trapdoor in the pantry ceiling leads to the attic.</p>
<p align="left">The attic holds nothing but a flock of pigeons that fly in and out through holes in the roof.</p>
