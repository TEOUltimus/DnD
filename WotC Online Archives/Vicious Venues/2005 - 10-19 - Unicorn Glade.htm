<p align="LEFT">This woodland jewel is hard to find, but breathtakingly 
beautiful. It features lush wild grasses green as rarest emeralds. A 
profusion of wildflowers adds other jewel tones, and a clear pond gleams
 like a sapphire. All this verdant beauty, however, pales next to the 
noble beauty of the resident unicorns.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2005%20-%2010-19%20-%20Unicorn%20Glade_files/dx1019vv_viciousvenues_unicorn.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="297" width="204"></b>Generations
 ago, a powerful elder unicorn call Rey'in (along with a few allied 
clerics and wizards) established the glade as a sanctuary for unicorns 
in times of danger. During Rey'in's lifetime, the forest where the glade
 lies teamed with evil giants, humanoids, and dragons all bent on 
rooting out all good creatures and turning the whole woodland into a 
vast den of evil.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Rey'in chose a remote portion of the forest where the 
trees were both ancient and tall. Rugged hills surrounding the area made
 entry difficult. Many centuries of wind and wildfires created several 
natural clearings throughout the area, while succulent grasses and 
wildflowers grew in these glades and provided excellent grazing for 
unicorns. Rey'in created his sanctuary in the largest glade. Unicorns 
and other good sylvan creatures continue to use the glade to this very 
day. The current master of the glade is Taisias, a powerful celestial 
unicorn. A human ranger named Rebeca Bootes also helps protect the 
glade.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The glade has powerful magical protections (see Visiting
 the Glade), and most people have never heard of the place. A few tales 
about the glade have leaked out of the forest, but many folk usually 
dismiss them as mere legends or as flawed accounts of some locale hidden
 amid the planes. The glade is both real and entirely earthly, however.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>About Taisias and Rebeca</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Rey'in's bloodline has died out and Taisias has been 
assigned the task of keeping the glade safe and hidden. Exactly who has 
sent Taisias to the Material Plane is left to the DM to decide. Perhaps 
Taisias serves a woodland deity, such as Ehlonna, or perhaps he merely 
decided to take on the job himself. Taisias usually stays hidden in the 
glade. He relies on the resident unicorns and on Rebeca for news of the 
outside world.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Taisias (Celestial Charger): </b>hp 155; <i>MM </i>250.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> Taisias prefers to function as a 
strategist rather than battle foes directly. Doing so allows him to keep
 his presence on the Material Plane a secret. He doesn't shy away from 
combat when he deems it necessary, however. When trouble arises, Taisias
 usually sends a unicorn or Rebeca, or both, to look over the opposition
 and report back. He generally relies on Rebeca to drive off invaders 
and usually will help her with a <i>prayer</i> or <i>bless</i> spell 
before she goes off to battle. If Taisias chooses to join a fight 
himself, he chooses a key ally, usually Rebeca, and gives that character
 a <i>shield other</i> spell. He protects himself with <i>shield of faith</i> and <i>protection from energy.</i> He prefers to attack from a distance, using <i>searing light</i> and <i>holy smite. </i>When
 his offensive spells begin to run out during a long battle, he casts 
divine power on himself and closes in to melee. He picks out the most 
dangerous foe and uses his smite evil ability for his initial attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Rebeca has admired equine creatures since her youth. As a
 little girl, she loved horses and she yearned to meet a centaur or a 
unicorn. As an apprentice ranger, she worked alongside a herd of 
centaurs for the better part of a year, and finally met a unicorn one 
moonlit summer night. She eventually learned about Taisias and his glade
 and, through sheer persistence, met Taisias himself. The celestial 
charger quickly recognized Rebeca's dedication and her value as an ally.
 Today, Rebeca maintains a series of huts hidden near the glade. She 
moves among them throughout the year as she patrols the glade's borders.
 She discourages accidental visitors from approaching the glade and 
slays anyone hostile to unicorns.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Rebeca is a good-hearted soul who dislikes hurting 
anyone. Her usual approach to strangers who stray too close to the glade
 is to hide herself among the trees and greet them in a cheerful voice. 
Many folks have mistaken this voice in the trees for a dryad or other 
fey creature. Rebeca's skills at hiding and moving silently through 
dense undergrowth tend to reinforce the idea that she's something not 
quite of this world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When fighting in a wooded area, Rebeca prefers to stay 
hidden among the trees and snipe at her foes with her bow (see the Hide 
skill description). If foes approach, she uses her woodland stride 
ability to move to a new hiding place. In more open areas, she rides 
Cletus, her light warhorse and uses her bow from horseback.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When she has unicorn allies to assist her, Rebeca fights
 in much the same manner. The unicorns stay out of sight while Rebeca 
fires her bow from hiding. If the foe locates the ranger and closes to 
melee range, the unicorns charge out of hiding and Rebeca takes up her 
greatsword.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters aren't likely to stumble on the glade 
by accident, but they might come across Rebeca's hut. If the characters 
have reason to delve into the lore of unicorns, however, they're bound 
to encounter a few references to the glade. Here are a few things that 
might bring the glade to the group's attention.</p>
<ul>
<li> The characters hear or read an account of an ancient war that raged
 between good and evil in the forest. The good creatures won, but only 
because they had a hidden refuge. According to the tale, a few of the 
worst evil monsters still lie imprisoned in the forest, sealed away amid
 vast treasures of magic and gold.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> The tale of the conflict in the forest is true. There 
may or may not be evil creatures imprisoned in the forest at the DM's 
option. If such creatures exist, they're likely to be evil outsiders 
held in place with binding spells or evil giants held in temporal 
stasis. Characters who go poking around their prisons may release the 
captives, who will not be grateful for the intervention. Rebeca and 
Taisias won't be at all enthusiastic about attempts to disturb the 
prisoners, and they might act to prevent the characters from finding 
them.</p>
<ul>
<li> Local tales tell of a deadly place in the forest where the forces 
of darkness prevail and mortals cannot trust their own senses. To enter 
this place is almost certain death. However, if one can capture the 
guardian of the place (said to be either a fair maiden or an old man) 
one can drink from a magical pool and be cured of all ailments, 
including old age.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> This tale is a twisted account of the glade and its 
powerful wards. The maiden and the old man are Rebeca and Taisias. The 
rumor of the pool is pure fancy, though it's a good bet that Taisias 
could be persuaded to use his considerable healing powers on a truly 
deserving person.</p>
<ul>
<li> A bard's tale or song tells of a magical place where all the 
world's unicorns are born and where they all return when death is near. A
 single flower or blade of grass from this place is sufficient to charm 
any unicorn.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"> This is another distorted tale about the glade. The 
vegetation in the glade is luxuriant, but has no power over unicorns. 
Many unicorns are born in the glade, and quite a few choose to die 
there, but the glade isn't the source of all the unicorns, nor is it 
their sole graveyard. It is possible, however, that characters seeking 
some special material for use in a spell or magic item would do well to 
get a flower from the glade.</p>
<ul>
<li> A hermit woman lives deep in the forest. She lives off the land, 
but those who do her a good turn can expect to receive aid from all the 
sylvan creatures, and even from the trees themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This refers to Rebeca, and it's mostly true. Rebeca 
doesn't care for visitors, but anyone who befriends her has a powerful 
bargaining chip when dealing with most other residents of the forest 
where she lives. Evil creatures of the forest, however, feel an extra 
dose of ill will toward anyone who claims to be Rebeca's friend.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Glade</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The glade is about two miles long and a half a mile 
wide. It lies amid the wooded hills like a lake filled with colorful 
flowers and waving grasses. As noted earlier, the glade is hard to find,
 thanks to several layers of magical protection that Rey'in and his 
allies provided. The exact details of the glade's ward are left to the 
DM, but it is most likely that they represent an epic spell (see the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/881690000">Epic Level Handbook</a></i>), or elven high magic (see the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000">Forgotten Realms</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000"> Campaign</a></i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/fracc/882360000"><i>Setting</i></a>). The wards have the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole area is cloaked with a <i>screen</i> spell. Anyone viewing the glade sees a grove of ancient hardwood trees. The save DC against this illusion is 35.<br><br></li>
<li>The whole area is protected with an effect similar to a <i>repulsion</i>
 spell, except that there is no saving throw. Affected characters turn 
around and move away from the glade. They don't notice that they have 
done so until they are at least 100 yards away from the glade.<br><br></li>
<li>The whole area has a <i>dimensional lock</i> spell.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Any of the three effects can be dispelled. The caster 
level is 25. A successful dispel, however, merely suppresses the effect 
for 1d4 rounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Unicorns and ki-rins are immune to all three effects. (For example, unicorns can use their <i>teleport</i> abilities within the glade despite the <i>dimensional lock</i>
 effect.) Anyone Taisias invites into the glade becomes immune to all 
three effects for 24 hours. Taisias can grant up to four other creatures
 the power to give access to the glade. Currently, only Rebeca and one 
or two trustworthy unicorns who call the glade home have this privilege.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rebeca's Huts (EL 5-10)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Rebeca keeps four plain huts with wooden walls and 
thatched roofs within a half mile of the glade. Each has a lower floor 
with a stable for Cletus and one or two equine visitors and an upper 
floor with basic quarters for Rebeca. She keeps each hut stocked with 
basic supplies such as firewood, acorn flour, dried fruits, and some 
preserved meat. Rebeca spends a total of about three months out of each 
year at each hut, but she moves between them randomly. This allows her 
to keep an eye on the glade and keeps enemies guessing about where she 
is. When she's absent from a hut, Rebeca keeps the place unlocked. Needy
 travelers are welcome to her supplies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures:</b> As noted earlier, Rebeca lives in one 
hut along with Cletus, her warhorse. Rebeca's statistics are given in 
the About Taisias and Rebeca section.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though Rebeca doesn't guard her empty huts, some of her 
friends do. When Rebeca is absent, one or more of the following 
creatures are in residence or lurking nearby.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Centaurs (1-2):</b> hp 26 each; <i>MM</i> 32.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2010-19%20-%20Unicorn%20Glade_files/dx1019vv_viciousvenues_centaur.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="265" width="200">These
 fellows usually are out hunting and have decided to use the unused huts
 as a base for a few days. If asked, they claim the hut belongs to their
 herd.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Pixies (2-4):</b> hp 3 each; <i>MM</i> 236.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The pixies usually don't harass Rebeca, but they'll play
 their tricks on any visitors Rebeca hasn't told them to expect (and 
sometimes they'll even play pranks on folk they know the ranger has 
invited). The pixies are familiar with the local rumor about the hermit 
woman and will use their illusion powers to impersonate her. If someone 
takes the bait, the pixies send them all over the forest on silly 
errands such as finding a toadstool with exactly seven yellow spots, a 
triple acorn, or even the night's first moonbeam.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Werebears (2-4):</b> hp 62 each; <i>MM</i> 170.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This could be a family group or a troupe with 1d4 brown 
bears for company. The werebears usually pose as woodsfolk of some kind 
and they often are engaged in some sort of woodsy task, such as 
gathering acorns or mushrooms. Like the centaurs, they claim the hut is 
theirs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Glade Proper (EL 13)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If characters get a glimpse of the glade in its true 
form, they see a vast meadow bordered by ancient trees. Throughout most 
of the year, lush grass grows ankle high to a human and wildflowers make
 splashes of color here and there. A spring-fed pond has crystalline 
water and a fringe of reeds and cattails. In winter, snow usually 
blankets the glade, but a few patches of bright green show through here 
and there.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures:</b> Taisias dwells here along with a grace of regular unicorns.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Taisias (Celestial Charger): </b>hp 155; <i>MM </i>250.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Unicorns (3-6):</b> hp 42 each; <i>MM</i> 250.</p>
<p align="LEFT">See the About Taisias and Rebeca section for notes on 
Taisias's demeanor and tactics. When non-unicorns enter the glade, one 
of the regular unicorns approaches the visitors while Taisias and the 
remaining unicorns keep their distance.</p>
