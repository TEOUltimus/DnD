<p align="LEFT">This plain stone building wouldn't merit a second glance
 if it weren't for the very genuine looking bit of giant footwear -- a 
giant's massive leather sandal hangs above the door. A peek in the 
window reveals a room stuffed with some of the most outlandish footgear 
ever made. Who made all these fanciful wares? And is there more going on
 under the sign of the Giant's Sandal than shoemaking?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2007%20-%2004-27%20-%20The%20Giant%27s%20Sandal_files/dx20070427_sandal.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="221" width="272">Garvifra
 Dajklen, once a warrior in her clanhold's army, is now the proprietor 
of the Giant's Sandal, a shoe shop located in a predominantly human 
settlement. While she still lived in her clanhold, Garvifra was a 
leatherworker of some renown -- a talent not especially common among 
dwarves. She worked primarily as an armorer, producing both leather and 
metal armor for her clan. But an orc horde swarmed her clanhold, and its
 defenses proved inadequate to withstand the assault. Garvifra fell 
while defending a pocket of women and children, but awoke later amid the
 rubble of the clanhold to see a grig standing on her forehead. 
Introducing itself as Merrin the bard, the creature explained that it 
had been en route to an important gathering when the orc horde swept 
through the area, which is when it took refuge in the knapsack of a 
passing dwarf. Upon finding itself in the clanhold, it had made its way 
to Garvifra's armory in search of a scrap of leather to fashion itself a
 new suit of armor when the fighting broke out.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Garvifra thanked her odd benefactor for his timely 
healing and rashly promised him that he and his descendents would always
 be welcome in her home. Then the two parted ways, and Garvifra began to
 explore the ruins of her clanhold. She found a few survivors and led 
them out of the ruins, but dwarven lands proved inhospitable to her. 
Dwarves of other clans regarded her with suspicion for her failure to 
die in her clan's defense, and her story of being saved by a passing 
grig began to seem improbable even to her.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The shame of being a survivor eventually drove Garvifra 
away from dwarven lands altogether. She took up residence in a 
human-based settlement and began selling leather goods. Shoes were her 
best-selling products, and over time, she began to specialize in sturdy,
 serviceable shoes and boots. Her business prospered, and she began to 
deliver her products to outlying areas once a week. Her delivery wagon 
-- a custom-made red wagon with white wheels and "Garvifra's Leather 
Goods" emblazoned on the sides in gold letters -- was her pride and joy.
 But one day, while she was delivering a shipment of boots to a remote 
army outpost, her waiting wagon was crushed under the heel of a giant 
who was out hunting in the nearby hills. Enraged, she enlisted the aid 
of two army scouts, and when the giant was dead, she took one of its 
sandals -- the one that still bore traces of the paint from her wagon --
 as a trophy. Upon returning to her shop, she hung the shoe outside as a
 sign and promptly renamed her shop the Giant's Sandal.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One morning a few weeks later, Garvifra was surprised to
 find a dozen grigs in her storeroom. Identifying themselves as 
relatives of Merrin, they announced that they had come to live with her,
 according to her bargain with the bard. Nonplussed, Garvifra agreed to 
house them, and she soon found herself with a band of merry assistants. 
At first Garvifra blessed her good fortune. The grigs proved to be 
industrious workers, and she had been behind on her orders. But all too 
soon, their high productivity outpaced her needs. Merchandise began to 
pile up in her back room, and though her sales increased, it seemed that
 her backstock was still growing faster than she could sell it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All Garvifra's efforts to slow down production came to 
naught. The grigs were enjoying their new trade and refused to halt 
their shoemaking efforts, even for a day. Garvifra even tried cutting 
off their leather and thread supplies, but somehow they continued to 
find more materials. Linen shoes, wooden shoes, and shoes made from the 
tanned hides of creatures other than cows began to appear on her 
shelves. Some of these novelties became quite popular in the settlement,
 and the grigs' fanciful designs appealed to humans, elves, and even 
halflings -- though Garvifra herself was not impressed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As Garvifra's shoe stock soared, her disposition 
deteriorated. Where was she to put all these shoes? She built two 
storage sheds behind her shop and filled them within a season. She was 
forced to cut prices to the bone to move old stock just to make room for
 new. Thus, she has become known as the "sour shoemaker" to those who 
live in her town.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eventually, she hired an assistant named Perweddin to 
help her manage the business. Perweddin seemed able to manage the deluge
 of shoes more effectively than Garvifra could, and though the sour 
shoemaker wondered where Perweddin put all the excess, she has not 
openly questioned her assistant's abilities. In reality, Perweddin has 
been storing each day's new merchandise temporarily in the 
extradimensional spaces above <i>rope tricks,</i> and feeding merchandise more than a week old to a <i>bag of devouring</i>
 that he keeps in his quarters at the rear of the store. Customers who 
stray into the storage room run the risk of being hit in the head by 
pairs of shoes appearing suddenly out of expired <i>rope trick</i> 
spells, so Perweddin has posted a large "Danger" sign on the door to 
that area. He lets no one into his room, however, because he lives in 
fear that someone will stick a hand into his <i>bag of devouring.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Regular customers of the Giant's Sandal have long ago 
learned that they must buy any shoes they like right away, or they will 
be gone. Special orders are problematical -- size adjustments are easy 
enough to get, but unless the shoe is one that Garvifra designed (that 
is, a sturdy, utilitarian dwarf design), older designs can never be 
restocked. (The grigs make only what they desire, and they prefer to 
make new designs. In fact, they have difficulty remembering the details 
of old designs.)</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Giant's Sandal might be found in a settlement of 
nearly any size, so long as the surrounding area has a significant 
dwarven presence. Garvifra has lots of wares to sell (as she'll tell 
anyone willing to listen), and if her shop is not located in a city, 
it's a good bet she has some other pool of customers to serve. She might
 ship footwear to dwarven strongholds in the area, have a contract to 
make shoes for the local military, or perhaps she sells her wares 
wholesale to traveling peddlers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters might visit the Giant's Sandal when 
out shopping for gear, or they might become involved in some other 
aspect of Garvifra's business, as suggested here.</p>
<ul>
<li> A group of dwarves believes that Garvifra's clan stronghold fell 
because a traitor either sabotaged the fortifications or simply fled 
before the final assault, leaving a fatal gap in the stronghold's 
defenses.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Garvifra might be the suspected traitor or she might 
have information that could reveal the culprit. In the latter case, 
Garvifra might not be aware that she knows something significant. If 
Garvifra is the suspected traitor, it's up to the DM to decide if she's 
guilty or not. It's not likely that Garvifra betrayed her clan out of 
spite or in return for money, but she might have experienced a moment of
 weakness on the eve of battle. In any case, if any accusation against 
Garvifra is substantiated, she will be stripped of her name and clan 
status -- a horrific result from Garvifra's perspective. Garvifra might 
well try to enlist the PCs' assistance with her defense.</p>
<ul>
<li> Garvifra wants to sponsor an expedition back to her old clan stronghold, and the PCs can take on the job.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Garvifra will supply the PCs with the stronghold's 
location and a rough map of the interior. She might wish to join the 
expedition herself, or she might simply require a share of any proceeds.
 Garvifra could have several reasons to have the site explored. She 
might want to reconnoiter the stronghold prior to an attempt to resettle
 it, she might want to recover a specific item from the place, or 
perhaps she wants to discover just how the stronghold fell.</p>
<ul>
<li> An envoy from a major dwarven clan is abducted while passing 
through the community where the Giant's Sandal is located. The PCs are 
hired to look into the matter -- or perhaps they're suspected of the 
deed themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The missing envoy might be one of Garvifra's friends or 
relatives, or perhaps an old rival. In any case, the missing envoy 
secretly visited Garvifra before vanishing. The envoy might have carried
 a letter to her, or just stopped in to talk over old times or to bury 
the hatchet. In any case, Garvifra has enough information to allow the 
PCs to track down the missing dwarf.</p>
<ul>
<li> Garvifra needs help tracking down a shipment of rare leather.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Garvifra wants to begin work on several sets of 
masterwork studded leather armor for a special client and has made 
arrangements to acquire certain necessary materials for the project. The
 leather, however, has not arrived. The seller might have decided to 
hold out for a better price, the shipment might have been waylaid, or 
perhaps the people carrying it have simply gotten lost in the 
wilderness.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Giant's Sandal (EL --)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The giant's sandal has a plain stone façade with a pair 
of shuttered windows and a sturdy wooden door. As noted earlier, a 
giant's sandal literally hangs from the front of the shop. During 
business hours, the shutters are open and the door is unlocked.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Inside, the Giant's Sandal has a sales area with a 
counter and rack upon rack of shoes. Stools are provided to assist with 
fittings. Behind the counter lie several back rooms, and most of them 
are stuffed with more shoes. There's also a workroom for the grig 
cobblers, a bedchamber for Perweddin, a kitchen, and a pantry. The grigs
 work, eat, and sleep in their room. Garvifra has an apartment in the 
basement. Perweddin keeps a garden for flowers and vegetables behind the
 shop and has decorated the kitchen, his room, and the grigs' room with 
many potted plants.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs first enter Garvifra's store.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">Though this shop should be spacious judging by its ample
 square footage, the interior evokes a feeling of claustrophobia. 
Literally every nook and cranny is crammed with shoes -- shoes of all 
descriptions, from the mundane to the outright fanciful. Leather shoes, 
linen shoes, carved wooden shoes, rubber shoes -- even bark shoes and 
boots with metal toes line the shelves. Shoes are stacked on counters, 
piled into bins, and even hung from the ceiling in spots. Some shoes are
 plain and sturdy -- worthy of a dwarf warrior or a working farmer. 
Others are whimsical creations decorated with feathers, small gems, and 
bits of colored fluff. Regardless of its style, every pair appears quite
 well made, and indeed, the place appears to have quite a bit of local 
traffic.</p>
<p align="LEFT">From somewhere in the stacks, a muffled voice is 
audible. "Look at this!" the voice exclaims. "Just where do they expect 
me to put all this stuff? My walls aren't made of rubber! And -- oh, now
 here's an interesting pair. Only an elf would buy this! If only they'd 
listen to reason -- but no. Perweddin! Now where is that boy?"</p>
<p align="LEFT">From somewhere in the rear of the store, a lithe young 
half-elf bursts into the room. "Here I am, Garvifra!" he calls loudly. 
"Did you see those gorgeous new -- oh! Hello there! Welcome to the 
Giant's Sandal, strangers!"</p>
</td>

<p align="LEFT">Both Garvifra and Perweddin are more than happy to 
assist customers with locating shoes, though Perweddin has a clearer 
idea where any given kind of shoe is in the store.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> Though Garvifra spends most of her time 
thinking about her business, she's always ready to take up her axe if 
necessity calls for it (a habit she learned while still very young). She
 wears her chain shirt under a simple leather tunic with an ankle-length
 skirt. If Garvifra can't defuse a situation by talking it out, she 
grabs her axe and buckler and attacks the opposition's leader or the 
biggest troublemaker. She's always on the lookout for chances to use her
 sneak attack ability (which usually means working with Perweddin to 
flank someone). If necessary, she'll feign a retreat, withdrawing into 
the shop and hiding among her bountiful inventory. Once out of sight, 
she uses her Hide and Move Silently skills.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Perweddin does what he can to support Garvifra in a fight. He first uses <i>charm person</i>
 on a fighting character (though not against anyone Garvifra is 
attacking) to help defuse a fight. If that fails, he moves in to use <i>touch of fatigue.</i> After that, he relies on his rapier. He's always watching for chances to set up flanking attacks with Garvifra.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The grigs (all of whom have statistics similar to those 
of Quaal, above) regard any battle as a chance to romp. They usually 
avoid physically dangerous opponents and instead swarm around opposing 
spellcasters, using their weapons to disrupt spells. If Garvifra or 
Perweddin gets into trouble, a few grigs might produce armfuls of 
Perweddin's potted plants, which they hurl down to use with their <i>entangle</i>
 powers. The plants are too small to hold anyone immobile, but they are 
large enough to slow movement and impose combat penalties as noted for 
the entangled condition (<i>DMG</i> 300).</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Giant's Sandal as a Darker Place</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">It's possible that Garvifra really did deliberately 
betray her clanhold. She might have been motivated by greed, or perhaps 
she had some score to settle with a rival. If so, it's a good bet that 
she really has a neutral evil alignment and that her business is a cover
 for some sinister plot -- or just a front for a smuggling or fencing 
operation. With her talent for stealth, Garvifra might work as a 
mercenary, spy, or killer for hire. If so, Perweddin most likely is in 
on the deal and also has an evil alignment. The grigs, however, are 
probably unaware of their hostess's true colors. (Garvifra might have 
been on the run from justice when she met her original grig benefactor.)
 The grigs regard Garvifra's dark moods as general dwarven surliness and
 think nothing of it, and Garvifra is very careful to keep them from 
learning otherwise.</p>
