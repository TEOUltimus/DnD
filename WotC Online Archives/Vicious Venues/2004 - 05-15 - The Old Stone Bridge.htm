<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="570"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">The crumbling stone bridge crosses a fast-flowing river 
in a single graceful (if bedraggled) arch. Patches of moss grow so 
thickly on the ancient masonry that the bridge seems wrapped in an 
emerald blanket, albeit somewhat threadbare. An expansive sandbar has 
built up on the bridge's upstream side, and a thicket of reeds and 
scraggly bushes have taken root there, creating a small island (at least
 while the river stays fairly low).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As one might infer from its appearance, the bridge 
doesn't get much traffic these days. Perhaps the road that the bridge 
carries across the river has fallen into disuse because a newer, faster 
route has been opened through the area. Possibly the bridge is a remnant
 of a lost civilization. Perhaps the bridge lies along a trade route 
that has fallen into disuse for some reason -- war, resource depletion, 
or simply a shift in consumer tastes. Or perhaps the bridge is merely 
very old and was never heavily used.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In any case, the bridge proves a livelier place than it 
looks. Any number of wild creatures might find the bridge and its 
sandbar a handy lair, hunting ground, or just a place to chat with 
passersby. The next section details several possible denizens.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the bridge, the water is about 20 feet deep and 60 
feet wide, with a strong current. As noted earlier, a sandbar has built 
up on the upstream side of the bridge, forming a low island that extends
 from the left back about 20 feet into the river. The bar is about 70 
feet long.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The bridge has a main span 70 feet long, with a short 
ramp at either end. The roadbed is about 5 feet above the average water 
level at the riverbanks and about 10 feet above the water at the center 
of the arch. Where it crosses the bridge, the roadway is 15 feet wide, 
with a stone parapet a foot thick and 2 feet high on either side. Two 
stone piers, each about 15 feet from the riverbank, support the bridge. 
Each pier is about 8 feet thick and runs the width of the bridge. The 
sandbar is piled around pier at the left bank.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bridge Parapet:</b> 1 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 180; break DC 35; Climb DC 20.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bridge Roadway:</b> 2 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 360; break DC 37.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Bridge Piers:</b> 8 ft. thick; hardness 8; hp 1,440; break DC 51; Climb DC 20.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Despite the slope and the mossy stones, movement on or 
over the bridge isn't hampered, though the roadbed rises high enough to 
provide cover to a creature of Small or Medium size when it stands at 
one end of the bridge and the attacker stands at the other end. A Tiny 
or smaller creature has total cover when it stands at one end of the 
bridge and its attacker stands at the other end.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One can climb up 5 feet from the surface of the river or
 the sandbar (Climb DC 15) to the top of the bank and then move toward 
the bridge. A belt of saplings and brush about 15 feet wide provides 
soft cover, but the ground is uneven. Both the brush and the condition 
of the ground hamper movement. Characters move through the brush at 
quarter speed (one 5-foot square costs 20 feet of movement). Characters 
with the woodland stride class feature move at half speed (one 5-foot 
square costs 20 feet of movement). Charging or running isn't possible 
when movement is hampered.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The sandbar is smooth, but it is overgrown just as the 
riverbanks are. Movement is hampered on the sandbar unless the character
 has the woodland stride class feature. The thicket also provides soft 
cover.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Near where the bridge meets the riverbanks, characters 
can climb up 5 feet to the roadway (Climb DC 15 and +5 on the Climb 
check for having two surfaces to hold). It's possible to climb the piers
 as well. The piers are about 9 feet from the water's surface or from 
the sandbar to the top of the parapet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though the current near the bridge is fairly strong, it's not quite as deadly as a "strong" current described in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i>
 Swimming the river requires a Swim check (DC 15). On any failed check, a
 swimmer takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and is swept 1d4x10 feet 
downstream and must make a second Swim check (also DC 15) to stay on the
 surface; if the first check is failed by 5 or more, the swimmer 
automatically goes below the surface without a second check. The river 
takes many twists and bends, and after 1d4 failed checks, the current 
brings a failing swimmer up against one bank or the other.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs first 
approach the bridge. The text assumes the bridge lies in a forested area
 and that the season is late spring or early summer. Adjust accordingly 
for a different time of year. Since most watercourses support lush plant
 life, the description works for most kinds of terrain.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">The trail takes a sudden dive, then levels out into a 
brief stretch of cobblestones. Beyond that rises a bridge of flaking 
stone that spans a wide river in a single low arch. The span's center 
seems just high enough to block the view of the bridge's opposite end. 
The stonework seems well weathered. The roadway is clear except for a 
few branches from the overhanging trees. The air feels cool and moist, 
thanks to the shade from the trees, and it must be so most days, judging
 from the thick moss that clings to the bridge's sides.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Below the bridge, the river runs dark and swift, 
burbling like a pot just beginning to simmer. The force of the water has
 built up a sandbar against one end of the bridge. The sandbar fills 
half the river's channel and extends upstream at least as far as a close
 bowshot. A tangle of brush and reeds covers the sandbar and both sides 
of the river, though the path to the bridge is clear.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters might meet almost anything at the bridge. Here are some possibilities at several different encounter levels.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lizardfolk (EL 3-4)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The lizardfolk have been hunting and fishing near the 
bridge. They might be a hunting party from a nearby colony or perhaps 
they are scouts form a more distant colony sent to find a site for a 
splinter colony.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lizardfolk (2-3):</b> hp 11 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 169.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The lizardfolk most likely see the PCs 
as a source of fresh meat and loot. Usually one keeps watch from the 
riverbank while the remainder fish from the sandbar right below the 
bridge. The sentry gives a hiss, then hails the PCs, demanding a toll 
for the privilege of crossing the bridge. </p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"You there," says a sibilant voice from the riverbank. A
 single armed lizardfolk blocks the entrance to the bridge. "Thisss 
bridge belongsss to lizardkind, and hazzz since my great-grandsire took 
it in fair combat from the humansss who built it. If you would passss, 
you must pay the toll."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The toll requested depends upon how well off the party 
appears, but 1 gp per person is the average. While the sentry talks, its
 comrades take to the water and climb out on the riverbank opposite the 
party. They use the bridge to screen themselves from view. When the 
party approaches the sentry or tries to cross the bridge without paying 
the toll, all the lizardfolk attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wood Apes (EL 5-8)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Dire apes aren't the only savage primates that can 
menace the PCs. A troop of aggressive monkeys (we're using statistics 
for advanced baboons here) has moved onto the sandbar, using it as a 
base for raiding traffic moving along the road. You might think of 
baboons as tropical creatures, but baboonlike animals can be found in 
almost any clime, and this troop could lurk not far from the PCs' own 
back doors. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wood Apes (5-10): </b>CR 1; Medium animal; HD 3d8+3; 
hp 16; Init +2; Spd 40 ft., climb 30 ft.; AC 13, touch 12, flat-footed 
11; Base Atk +2; Grp +4; Atk +4 melee (1d6+3, bite); Full Atk +4 melee 
(1d6+3, bite); SQ low-light vision; AL N; SV Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +2; 
Str 15, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 4.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills</i><i>and Feats:</i> Climb +12, Listen +5, Spot +5, Swim +5; Alertness, Athletic.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The bulk of the apes stay hidden on the 
sandbar, but they keep sentries posted on the bridge. The sentries sit 
on the highest points, atop the parapets on either side. The sentries 
give a low hoot when they notice anyone approaching.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The troop might be cautious or aggressive. Cautious 
troops live by hunting. Their sentries stand their ground, hopping 
around and screeching as the PCs approach. If attacked, or even if a 
character comes with in15 feet, the sentries dive off the bridge and 
swim to the sandbar. If pursued, the whole troop attacks. The troop 
might later follow the PCs to their campsite and try to raid their food 
supplies.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An aggressive troop lives by hunting. They're cagey 
enough to try to take their victims off guard. The sentries for an 
aggressive troop hop around, hooting and capering. Their antics seem 
somewhat comical. While this display is going on, however, the rest of 
the troop leaves the sandbar and circles around to attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trolls (EL 7-9)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Yes, it's hackneyed (and a bad pun as well), but every 
campaign should have at least one "troll bridge." In this case, the 
trolls are scrags.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Scrags (2-4);</b> hp 63 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> pages 247-248.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> Since the scrags regenerate only when 
they're immersed (or mostly immersed) in water, they attempt to draw the
 PCs into (or at least near) the river if they can. To this end, the 
trolls have stuffed some old clothes and discarded armor with leaves and
 twigs and left this crude mannequin partly concealed on the sandbar. 
Near the mannequin lies a torn backpack with several bottles, vials, and
 rolls of cloth spilling out.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Half the scrags remain out of sight under the bridge, 
and the other half lie concealed on the sandbar, not far from the 
mannequin. These trolls, too, are out of sight thanks to the thicket 
growing on the sandbar. When either group of scrags hears any activity 
on or near the bridge, one of them lets out a low moan. Thanks to the 
acoustics and the rushing water, it's impossible to tell exactly where 
the sound comes from. Anyone looking at the sandbar spots the mannequin 
and the backpack. The mannequin lies about 40 feet from the center of 
the bridge. It looks amazingly lifelike lying in the reeds. To a casual 
viewer, it looks like a body in armor. Even someone who takes an action 
to study the figure might be fooled. If the viewer is not adjacent to 
the mannequin, it takes a DC 15 Spot check to realize it's fake. A -1 
penalty applies to the check for each 10 feet of distance (-4 for a 
viewer at the center of the bridge).</p>
<p align="LEFT">If no one seems likely to approach the mannequin, or if 
anyone calls out to it, the scrags try for a bit more communication (one
 scrag speaks Common).</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Ohhhh...help me please," groans a gravely voice. "They 
threw me off the riverboat . . . my friends . . . wanted my treasure . .
 . But all they got was my money. . . not my. . . ."The voice fades off 
to nothing. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The scrags attack anyone who climbs down to approach the
 mannequin. They tend to stick to the water, where they can regenerate, 
and they have cover against attacks launched from land. A character on 
land, however, gains a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls against the scrags
 for being on higher ground. If the scrags' ruse fails, they scramble up
 the banks and attack as best they can. They may attempt to grapple 
characters and drag them into the river, or they may simply fight 
awhile, then return to regenerate. (Once immersed, they can regenerate 
any damage they have taken except for fire or acid damage.) The latter 
tactics works well if there are more than two scrags.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Nymph (EL 7-8)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The bridge's cool beauty has attracted a nymph, who has 
made the sandbar her abode. They nymph might also have a pair of tigers 
or brown bears as allies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Nymph:</b> hp 27, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 197.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Brown Bears (2):</b> hp 51 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 269.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tigers (2):</b> hp 45 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 281.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The nymph isn't hostile unless the PCs have been despoiling the countryside near the bridge.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most of the time, the nymph sits at the far end of the 
sandbar (away from the bridge) and sings to herself. She takes a dip in 
the river from time to time just because she can. She's curious about 
travelers, however, and swims down to the bridge to check things out if 
she sees or hears anyone crossing the bridge or entering the river:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"What ho!" calls a sweet feminine voice from the general
 direction of the rushing water. "What brings you to this lonely place? 
And what news have you?" A quick look around reveals a shapely female 
humanoid swimming in the turbid water. The creature has long, coppery 
hair, but apparently no raiment at all.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs stop to converse with the nymph, she asks 
about their business and about various individuals from the nearest 
town, some of whom have visited the bridge in the past.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"And what of the miller's son Aaron?" she asks with a 
twinkle in her eye. "Such a fine, strong lad. And the widow Holbright? 
She comes often to gather herbs and chat, but I've not seen her for nigh
 onto three weeks now. I hope nothing has happened to her. The widow's 
tales make it seem as though I know everyone in the town -- the farmer 
who keeps a heavenly horse, the junk dealer who accepts donated items a 
bit before their owners are ready to part with them, the woman who 
sleeps during the day because she charts the stars by night -- everyone 
thinks she is a lady of the evening or worse. Or have you tales of other
 towns and other folk for me?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs prove hostile, the nymph sticks to the river 
and uses her spells and special attacks to drive them off. While 
swimming, she has improved cover against attacks from creatures that 
aren't also swimming (+8 AC). If using the typical spell array given in 
the <i>Monster Manual,</i> she begins with <i>call lightning</i> and 
calls one bolt each round until the spell is exhausted. If anyone comes 
within 30 feet of her, the nymph uses her stunning glance or blinding 
beauty power.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the nymph has any bear or tiger allies, she sends them to circle around the party and attack from the rear.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Green Dragon (EL 10)</b></p>

secret or concealed door is as though actively looking for it; +1 racial
 bonus on all saving throws, +1 racial attack bonus with a sling or 
thrown weapon, +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks 
(already figured into the statistics given above).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> Jouglar gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Jouglar can react to danger 
before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his 
Dexterity bonus to AC even while flat-footed or when struck by an 
invisible attacker.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Possessions:</b><i>+1 studded leather armor, +1 buckler, +1 ring of protection, ring of climbing, +1 rapier,</i> sling, 20 bullets, <i>potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of cure moderate wounds</i> (38 charges).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>Erilguolvag and Jouglar have developed 
the following scam. They stay in hiding (in this case, hunkering down in
 the thickets along the riverbank) and keep a sharp lookout for any 
creatures approaching. Given the dragon's keen senses, the two usually 
have no difficulty detecting potential victims before they're seen.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once they spot potential victims (in this case, the party), the dragon casts <i>shield</i>
 (increasing her Armor Class to 27), and then she and the rogue stage a 
mock fight. In the PCs' first view of the sham battle, Jouglar staggers 
backward, gagging and choking. Then Erilguolvag seizes the halfling in 
her jaws (she doesn't have the Snatch feat, but she can grab the 
halfling when he helps). At that point, Jouglar appears to notice the 
PCs.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Help, please!" cries the fellow in the dragon's jaws. 
"Arrrrgh!! Hurry! You can get him if you *urk* close in now and go for 
it together! He's just breathed! ARRRRGH! We'll *ack* split the 
treasure!"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Jouglar knows the dragon is a female, but he's aware 
that thinking characters would wonder how he knows such a thing, so he 
uses the male pronoun.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the ruse works, Erilguolvag waits until the PCs get 
with about 15 feet, then drops Jouglar (a free action) and breathes on 
the PCs. The halfling lands on his feet and delays any actions until 
after the dragon breathes. After that, he tumbles into a flanking 
position and sneak attacks a PC or lobs a sling bullet at a spellcaster.
 In subsequent rounds, the dragon moves in to make melee attacks, and 
the rogue tries his best to get into sneak attack position. Erilguolvag 
breathes again as soon as she is able, but she tries to avoid damaging 
Jouglar. She uses her Power Attack feat whenever she thinks she can get 
away with it (she usually adds only 3 or 4 points to her damage). On a 
round when she cannot breathe, she may cast <i>true strike</i>, then follow up with a bite; she uses Power Attack to gain the maximum damage bonus of +14.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If he or Erilguolvag takes heavy damage, Jouglar can use his Use Magic Device skill to activate his <i>wand of cure moderate wounds</i> to heal the damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the two start losing the fight, they beat a hasty 
retreat. Jouglar leaps into the river and does his best to stay afloat 
until Erilguolvag can pluck him out. Erilguolvag simply flies away, and 
she even returns for the halfling if she thinks she can do so without 
getting killed.</p>
