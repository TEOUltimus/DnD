<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Exactly
 what is brewing in the depths of this ruined inn? Are the denizens 
cooking dinner, or do they have a recipe for something more sinister?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>Background for the DM</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Viroe's
 Aerie was once a sprawling complex of dormitories, stables, warehouses,
 taprooms, and kitchens geared toward servicing caravan traffic crossing
 the high mountain pass where the inn stood. In time, a village grew up 
around the inn, and the area became a center for miners, woodcutters, 
trappers, and shepherds. The villagers included a high proportion of 
dwarves and deep halflings who forged an alliance with a tribe of stone 
giants living nearby. Stone giants became such frequent visitors to the 
village that Virodunin, the mountain dwarf who founded the inn, modified
 the place to accommodate giant-sized patrons.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Inn,
 village, and giants prospered together for decades until one cold 
winter when heavy snows closed the pass and left the village isolated 
for months. One dark, snowy night, a particularly large war party of 
frost giants attacked the inn and village. The residents and their stone
 giant allies resisted as well as they could, but couldn't turn back the
 onslaught. The frost giants slew all the stone giants, leveled the 
village, and looted the inn. Only a handful of villagers survived the 
attack, and frost giants marched most of those away to become slaves.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Today,
 a new tribe of stone giants has moved into the area, and all traces of 
the old tribe are gone, save for a few scattered bones. All that remains
 of the village are a few broken foundations and crumbling chimneys. The
 inn fared better. The stables and outbuildings are mere rubble, but the
 main building, being exceptionally well built, still stands.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recently,
 the inn has reopened under its old name. The new proprietor calls 
herself Viroduna, and she claims to be Virodunin's daughter, who has 
escaped from the frost giants and returned home to rebuild her father's 
business. Her story may be true, in which case Viroe's Aerie is simply a
 somewhat unusual inn with an equally unusual clientele. Or perhaps the 
person calling herself Viroduna is a bandit leader pretending to be a 
simple innkeeper. In that case, the inn serves as both headquarters and a
 convenient cover for the bandits. The inn not only allows the bandits 
to pose as harmless villagers, but it also gives them plenty of 
opportunities to look over potential victims to judge their wealth and 
ability to defend themselves. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>The Setup</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs might discover the inn during a trip through the mountains, or they
 might hear tales of the inn's history that draw them to the place. Such
 tales might include the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Atop
 a certain mountain pass, one can find an ancient inn where dwarves rub 
shoulders with giants and the patrons order their drinks literally by 
the barrel.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Recent
 attempts to reopen an old trade route through the mountains have been 
stymied by the appearance of a ruthless group of bandits that has 
stopped every major shipment along the route for the past three months.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The ruined village of Viroe's Aerie hides the entrance to an abandoned mine where a fabulous treasure lies concealed.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 struggling innkeeper called Viroduna seeks adventurers to join her in 
an adventure to rescue some captives from a group of frost giants.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 up to you to determine which of these bits of information, if any, are 
true. Your decisions may hinge on what you decide to do with Viroduna. 
Is she an honest innkeeper or a cunning bandit? Two characters are 
presented below, each at two different levels. The first is a genuine 
Viroduna, a female mountain dwarf. The second is Phriddoma, a female 
dwarf posing as Viroduna.</span></p>

instantaneous, it stops affecting Dologer if he moves more than 5 feet 
away and does not affect him again even if he returns before the 
duration expires. Viroduna may also cast a spell with a target of "You" 
on Dologer (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. Viroduna and 
Dologer can even share spells that do not normally affect creatures of 
the animal type.</span></p>

 bonus on checks to notice unusual stonework; can make a check for 
unusual stonework as though actively searching when within 10 feet and

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The

 straight and level for a space. At least twenty broken foundations lie 
on either side of the road, mostly hidden in the tall grass. Here and 
there, the stump of an old chimney is visible. Farther up the road lies a
 sprawling ruin that must cover an acre or two, and in the middle of 
that stands a massive stone building with shuttered windows and a great 
oaken door. Four chimneys, very much intact, stand at the four corners 
of the edifice, and curls of wood smoke stream steadily from two of 
them, both to the left of the massive door.</span></p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Depending on the actual state of affairs in the village, there may be nothing else to see here.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL varies):</b>
 If Viroduna has indeed reopened the inn, the PCs might see a shepherd 
or two tending a flock in the distance. The shepherd could be a human, a
 mountain dwarf, or even a stone giant. The shepherds have returned to 
the area with the reopening of the inn, but they use the area only as a 
summer pasture for their flocks. They live in crude huts some distance 
from the village ruins. The shepherds consider the ruins an unlucky 
place, and they avoid it when possible, though none of them are above 
slipping off to the inn for a drink or a hot meal once in awhile.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 shepherds can relate most of the history of the inn and village, (see 
the background section), and they have a fairly high opinion of 
Viroduna. They scoff at any tales of hidden treasure beneath the village
 ruins (even if you decide that such rumors are true). The shepherds 
assure the PCs that the frost giant raiders carried off everything of 
value.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 Phriddoma is using the inn as a headquarters, the area around the 
village is truly deserted, except for a few wild sheep. Phriddoma might 
post a guard in the ruined village. If so, the guard is a stone giant 
posing as a shepherd. The giant plays the role as best he can and can 
give the PCs much the same information as the genuine shepherds do. The 
guard also attempts to convince the PCs to visit the inn, even going so 
far as to invite them in for a drink if necessary. If the PCs mention 
any treasure hidden under the ruins, the guard is all ears and becomes 
even more insistent that the PCs visit the inn.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It
 is possible that Phriddoma and her bandits are lurking in the area at 
the same time Viroduna tries to reopen the inn. If so, Phriddoma and her
 bandits are never far from the village, and the PCs may meet them 
before coming to the ruins. The bandits first pose as simple shepherds, 
just to get a chance to size up the PCs. They warn the party to watch 
their backs when they visit the inn and hint that not every guest who 
goes in comes out again. They also warn the party to beware of false 
friends.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Closer
 to the inn, the shepherds in the area crowd their flocks into the 
ruins. They don't like the place, but they feel safer near the inn, 
where Viroduna and her stone giant customers are at hand. The shepherds 
assure the PCs they are safe near the inn but warn them to beware of 
dangerous giants and bandits farther afield.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Stone Giants (1-4):</b> hp 119 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 124.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 The stone giants are neutral good if Viroduna is in residence at the 
inn or neutral evil if she is not. Good giants are content to chat with 
the PCs before going back to tending their sheep. Evil giants may 
attempt to lead the PCs into an ambush or attack if the PCs become 
suspicious.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Shepherds (5-8): </b>hp
 3-9 each; the shepherds are human or mountain dwarf commoners, levels 1
 to 3. They are unarmored (AC 10) and armed only with knives and 
quarterstaffs.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b> If attacked, the shepherds let their dogs do the fighting while they flee with their flocks.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Riding dogs (5-8):</b> hp 13 each.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 The shepherds use these big dogs to control and protect their flocks. 
If the shepherds or their sheep are threatened, they attack as a pack, 
surrounding and flanking opponents when they can.</span></p>

new. They're built from oak planks planed smooth and freshly shellacked.
 Their wrought iron fittings don't have a speck of rust and look as
