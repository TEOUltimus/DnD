<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 old mansion with the swaybacked roof sits brooding on its hilltop, half
 hidden by the blighted remains of an orchard. Are the eerie lights and 
strange sounds coming from within a mere local tale told to frighten 
children and gullible travelers, or does something sinister lurk within 
the mansion's decaying walls?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Background for the DM</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 mansion was once a manor house owned by Kincep family. The Kinceps were
 an old and respected noble family, though not one of any great 
political import. Though fairly wealthy, the Kinceps always lived simply
 and enjoyed few luxuries while always avoiding anything ostentatious. 
The family home was large, but very practical and well hidden behind an 
encircling orchard. It was a point of pride among the Kinceps that each 
generation made its way in life mostly on its own, starting out with a 
small inheritance and earning a living through business, adventuring, or
 public service. In more recent years, a series of misfortunes and 
disasters all but wiped out the youngest generation of Kinceps, and many
 believed that the family had fallen into poverty, then died out. In 
fact, the sole heir, Jaccobux Kincep, had traveled to foreign lands as 
an adventurer and mercenary, becoming quite rich in the process. In 
time, Jaccobux returned to his family home, which had already fallen 
into disrepair, and settled down to retire with his extensive collection
 of books. Almost at once, Jaccobux became a scholarly hermit, poring 
over books day and night, and barely eating and seldom sleeping. Old age
 eventually overcame him one afternoon as he sat reading in his favorite
 armchair, but Jaccobux didn't notice. He simply kept right on reading 
and taking copious notes. Jaccobux had become a ghost.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Setup</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 old Kincep mansion is best located on a hilltop at the edge of a 
village or town, but it also might exist on the outskirts of a city. No 
matter what the location, having a graveyard nearby should make the 
place seem even more sinister.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 PCs might simply stumble on the house while traveling or exploring. 
They also might hear a few local tales about strange doings at the 
place, such as the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Wolves
 gather in the orchard on moonless nights, howling at the ghostly blue 
lights that show behind the crooked shutters in an upstairs room. The 
wolves linger until just before dawn, then fade away like ghosts before 
sunrise.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many
 visitors have stopped by the house over the years. Some were beggars 
seeking shelter, some were fugitives from the law, and some were thrill 
seekers. The survivors report that the whole house seems alive. The 
tattered furnishings move (but only when one is not looking), doors open
 and close by themselves, lanterns light spontaneously (and go out just 
as quickly), and the whole place creaks and groans as though it was 
about to collapse. Meanwhile shadowy figures lurk in dark corners and 
heavy footsteps -- accompanied by rattling chains -- can be heard on the
 upper floors. No one who has tried to stay through the night or ascend 
to the upper floors has ever been seen alive again.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 spirit of Jaccobux Kincep haunts the house. The last of the ancient 
Kincep family, Jaccobux died in a foreign land, and he has returned to 
his ancestral home, where he endlessly laments the loss of his life and 
the decline of his family fortunes. Only the discovery of a true Kincep 
heir can lay the spirit to rest.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Only
 days after old Jaccobux died, thieves broke into the house. They were 
looking for anything valuable, but they were mostly interested in 
looting the family silver from the kitchen and in searching the house 
for Jaccobux's earthly wealth. (Jaccobux was reputed to be a wealthy 
man, despite his family's decline.) Everything went well for the thieves
 until they reached the library on the top floor. There, the very books 
attacked, crushing and smothering the invaders. It is said that the 
spirits of the thieves are now doomed to guard the very treasures they 
once sought to loot.<br><br></span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 house isn't haunted at all. It is the headquarters for a group of 
particularly vicious kidnappers and assassins acting under the direction
 of a fiendish leader who delights in their acts of violence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It's
 up to you to decide which, if any, of these rumors are true (perhaps 
they all are). See the following sections for ways to use these rumors 
as adventure hooks.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">About Jaccobux</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jaccobux
 Kincep is bound to the vast library he accumulated during his life. 
After his death, he has continued to collect books, relying on both his 
ghost powers and the small cadre of minions he has gathered to acquire 
the books he craves. Jaccobux might prove a harmless -- if eccentric -- 
old spirit, a dangerous undead menace, or even a valuable ally, 
depending on how you would like to use him in your campaign. If you 
decide to use him as a villain, you might want to reduce his sorcerer 
levels somewhat. As presented here, Jaccobux is a formidable opponent 
and is quite capable of defeating all but the most powerful adventurers.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 life, Jaccobux was a sorcerer and a professional adventurer who 
specialized in stealth and quick kills. Depending on how you choose to 
use him, Jaccobux's career might have involved various noble causes 
(spying on evil tyrants, performing daring rescues, and serving as an 
unobtrusive bodyguard), truly despicable acts (assassinating targets, 
framing innocent people, and ferreting out revolutionaries and freedom 
fighters), or something in between (raiding dungeon, doing battlefield 
reconnaissance, and being a general spellcaster for hire). As noted 
earlier, Jaccobux developed a thirst for knowledge in his old age and 
became a prodigious collector of books. He read avidly right up until 
the moment of his death, and his deep regret that he had died when he 
had so many books left to read provided the link to the mortal world 
that made him a ghost. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jaccobux's current statistics are as follows: </span></p>

Penetration, Spell Focus (Illusion), Spell Penetration.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Manifestation (Su):</b>
 Jaccobux dwells on the Ethereal Plane, and as an ethereal creature, he 
cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When he 
manifests, he partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but 
incorporeal there. When manifested, he remains partially on the Ethereal
 Plane, where he is it not incorporeal. At that point, he can be 
attacked by opponents on either the Material or Ethereal Planes. His 
incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not
 against foes on the Ethereal Plane. When Jaccobux is not manifested and
 is on the Ethereal Plane, his spells cannot affect targets on the 
Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal targets. When he
 manifests, his spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can 
affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on 
touch. While Jaccobux is manifested, his touch spells don't work on 
material targets. Jaccobux has two home planes, the Material and the 
Ethereal, and he is not considered extraplanar when on either plane. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animate Objects (Su):</b>
 Jaccobux can use this power at will as a standard action that does not 
provoke an attack of opportunity. The power functions as an <i>animate objects</i>
 spell (caster level 17th), except that Jaccobux cannot have more 
objects animated at once than his Charisma modifier (7). After Jaccobux 
uses this power, he must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Ghostly Lights</i> (Sp):</b> Jaccobux can use <i>dancing lights</i> or <i>light</i> at will (caster level 17th). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Incorporeal Traits: </b>Jaccobux
 is harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, 
spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. He has a 50% chance to
 ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or 
attacks made with ghost touch weapons. He can pass through solid 
objects, but not force effects, at will. His attacks ignore natural 
armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work
 normally against them. Jaccobux always moves silently and cannot be 
heard with Listen checks if he doesn't wish to be.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Inhabit Object (Su):</b>
 At will as a full-round action that does not provoke an attack of 
opportunity, Jaccobux can merge his ghostly body with any single object 
of up to Huge size and animate it indefinitely. If the object is 
destroyed while he's inside, Jaccobux is destroyed as well, though his 
rejuvenation power is likely to bring him back. Jaccobux can leave the 
object as a move action. While inhabiting an object, Jaccobux retains 
his senses (including any divination spells he's currently using and his
 darkvision), but cannot speak or cast spells. This power is otherwise 
similar to the <i>animate objects</i> spell (caster level 17th). </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rejuvenation (Su):</b>
 When Jaccobux would otherwise be destroyed he returns to his old haunts
 in 2d4 days with a successful level check (1d20 + 17) against DC 16. To
 prevent Jaccobux from rejuvenating and lay him to rest, all his books 
must be found and destroyed. There are literally thousands of books in 
Jaccobux's mansion -- not just in the library, but stuffed into every 
nook and cranny. Finding all of them could take a very long time. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Turn Resistance (Ex):</b> Jaccobux is treated as a 21-HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Undead Traits:</b>
 Jaccobux is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, 
paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that 
requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is 
harmless. He is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability 
damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, 
fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. He cannot be <i>raised,</i> and <i>resurrection</i> works only if it is willing. Darkvision 60 ft.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Sorcerer Spells Known</i> (6/8/8/8/7/6/4; save DC 17 + spell level, or 19 + spell level for Illusion spells): 0 -- <i>arcane mark, dancing lights, daze, detect magic, ghost sound, light, mage hand, prestidigitation, read magic; </i>1st -- <i>detect secret doors, disguise self, expeditious retreat, magic missile, shield; </i>2nd -- <i>darkvision, detect thoughts, ghoul touch, locate object, see invisibility;</i> 3rd -- <i>displacement, hold person, sepia snake sigil, suggestion; </i>4th -- <i>dimension door, greater invisibility, phantasmal killer;</i> 5th -- <i>magic jar, shadow evocation;</i> 6th -- <i>disintegrate.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ethereal Plane: </b>The
 following changes to the above statistics are in effect against 
opponents on the Ethereal Plane: Spd 30 ft.; AC 17, touch 14, 
flat-footed 15; Base Atk +9; Grp +8; Atk +8/+3 melee (1d8-1/x3, 
shortspear) or +12 ranged (1d8/19-20, masterwork light crossbow); Str 8.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Possessions: </b><i>Bracers
 of defense +2, ring of protection +2, amulet of natural armor +1, ring 
of mind shielding, lesser metamagic rod (Quicken Spell), </i>spear, 
masterwork light crossbow. These possessions are merely ethereal copies 
of the ghost's real equipment, which is stored in the mansion's library.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 Jaccobux spends most of his time endlessly reading his books. As a 
matter of habit, he animates the book he wishes to read, causing it to 
shuffle its way to his favorite armchair and to turn its own pages as 
Jaccobux pores over its contents.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jaccobux
 is fiercely protective of his books and is likely to attack anyone 
entering the mansion unless he recognizes the visitor as a fellow 
bibliophile. The most reliable way for a visitor to get on Jaccobux's 
good side is to offer him a new book for his collection.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jaccobux
 prefers to scare off intruders whenever he can. To this end, he keeps 
two sets of heavy manacles animated and has them constantly thump and 
rattle in the upper floors. When he becomes aware of an intrusion, he 
usually becomes ethereal and stalks the intruders. He uses his <i>animate objects </i>ability to make the place seem to come alive around the interlopers, and he may resort to <i>suggestion</i> or <i>magic jar</i>
 spells to force the invaders out. As an experienced sorcerer, he is 
well aware that opposing spellcasters might see him, and he makes good 
use of Hide checks to avoid being detected with <i>see invisibility</i> spells. If discovered, Jaccobux attacks with <i>disintegrate </i>or<i> shadow evocation</i> spells along with quickened<i> magic missiles </i>or<i> hold person </i>spell<i>s.</i> He also uses his<i> animate objects </i>ability
 to create reinforcements. If attacked on the Ethereal Plane, he uses 
his inhabit objects ability to escape from his attackers and possibly to
 attack their comrades on the Material Plane.</span></p>

 veritable thicket of gnarled old fruit trees has grown up here. There 
doesn't seem to be a straight or healthy trunk or branch in the bunch. A
 thick mat of fallen leaves, broken branches, and rotting fruit cover 
the ground underfoot, leaving only a few tufts of scraggly weeds growing
 here and there. </span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 search through the orchard reveals a couple of old, tumbledown sheds 
that hold rusty gardening tools. One shed also has a broken-down cider 
press and a few barrels of cider, now hopelessly spoiled. Another shed 
houses a basin with a natural spring that still provides good water, 
despite being mostly choked with debris from the orchard. A Knowledge 
(nature) or Profession (farmer) check (DC 10) reveals that all the trees
 are diseased, but holding their own. A second check (DC 15) reveals 
that the trees have not been properly tended for several decades at 
least.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 1, 3, or 7):</b>
 Local rumors about the place being a gathering ground for wolves might 
be just an exaggeration (perhaps small packs of feral dogs gather here 
from time to time), or perhaps not. Characters traipsing around under 
the trees might flush out a few tenants:</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Feral Dogs (3):</b> hp 6 each; see dog, <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 271.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 The dogs come here to shelter under the trees and drink from the 
spring. They occasionally try to harass the cats in the main house (see 
the sections on the stables and the foyer), but usually without much 
success. If you decide the dogs are hungry, they might attack the PCs. 
One dog tries to head straight for an unarmored character while the 
other two try to circle around behind.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wolves (2, or 8-16):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 283.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 The wolves might be part of a rogue pack that occasionally uses the 
orchard as a jumping off place for raids into the nearby town, or they 
may be sent to keep an eye on the place by a local vampire, who might 
prove to be allied with Jaccobux or possibly locked in a deadly struggle
 with the ghostly scholar. In the former case, Jaccobux might rely on 
the vampire as a source for new books. In return, Jaccobux guards one of
 the vampire's spare coffins. In the latter case, Jaccobux might serve 
as an advisor or mentor for a group of vampire hunters that have 
recently made one unsuccessful attack on the vampire and are now holed 
up in the mansion, licking their wounds and planning their next move.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In
 either case, the wolves aren't likely to let the PCs pass through in 
peace, and they fight with an unnatural cunning. If only a pair of 
wolves is present, they lie in wait for the party and try to flank the 
most powerful looking character, hoping to trip that person. If they 
succeed, one wolf turns to attack an unarmored character while the other
 tries to keep the fallen character from rising.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 a whole pack of wolves is present, they use similar tactics, but they 
attack the front and rear of the party simultaneously, trying to flank 
and trip the more powerful combatants and moving on to softer targets if
 they make someone fall.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Main Entrance</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 area once sported a curving drive surrounded by a small formal garden. 
Now the orchard grows right up to the eaves of the house. A few badly 
scarred statues are all that remains of the garden.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 search of the debris here (DC 20) reveals a few bits of broken statuary
 and possibly a small amount of treasure (level 3, 4, 5, or 7 as 
appropriate for the encounter EL). This treasure is left over from 
intruders that the area's guardians have defeated.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 3, 4, 5, or 7): </b>Characters
 exploring near the entrance or trying to enter the mansion rouse 
animated objects Jaccobux has left to guard the place.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated Small Statues (2):</b> hp 15 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 13.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated Medium Statues (2):</b> hp 31 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 13.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated Large Statues (2):</b> hp 52 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 14.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated Huge Trees (2):</b> hp 84 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 14.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>The
 objects attack anyone who approaches without an open book (one book 
serves as a safe pass for up to four characters). The statues are from 
the garden. The trees are old, dead trees taken from the orchard and 
moved here under their own power.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A fight here alerts Jaccobux and any guests he might have.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Stables</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One
 wing of the mansion served as a stable and carriage house. The place 
holds mounds of straw and hay now mostly rotted away into compost as 
well as a few broken down carriages.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A door here gives access to the main house.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 3 or 5): </b>Many feral cats that hiss and spit at any intruders call the stable home.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Cats (8 to 24):</b> hp 2; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 270.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>Though
 unfriendly, the cats aren't likely to attack unless attacked first. 
Still, a mass attack from a horde of clawing, biting, yowling cats might
 be just the thing to underscore the mansion's macabre atmosphere. If 
they decide to fight, the cats are likely to ambush the PCs with their 
superb Hide skills: They lie in wait until someone comes within reach. 
(As Tiny creatures, the cats have 0 reach, so they can attack only foes 
in their own squares.) The cats attack in groups of no fewer than four. 
Treat the cluttered stables as an area of tall grass, which increases 
the cats' Hide scores to +18. The stable's thick walls dampen most noise
 from a fight with the cats, though if the PCs do something foolish, 
such as set the place alight with a fireball or even open the door to 
the main house, while the fight is in progress, Jaccobux and any guests 
hear the commotion.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated Carriage:</b> hp 84; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 14.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>Jaccobux
 has selected one of the less dilapidated carriages to serve as a 
guardian. It attacks the moment anyone approaches the door to the main 
house or begins poking around in the stables too much.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The animated carriage makes considerable noise as it crashes around the stables, and this racket alerts Jaccobux.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Formal Garden and Crypt</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 area behind the main house once had extensive flower gardens and a 
hedge maze. Weeds and encroaching trees from the orchard have erased all
 but the faintest traces of the flower garden. A Search check (DC 15) 
reveals the remains of brick garden paths and a few climbing roses 
growing among the undergrowth. The hedge maze remains intact but is 
badly overgrown.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 family crypt lies at one end of the hedge maze, all but concealed under
 a mound of ivy, rosebushes, and trees. The crypt's stone door is well 
and truly stuck. It no longer opens, but determined characters could 
bash through it. The building is fairly low, and it would be easier to 
punch a hole through the roof and climb inside through it.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Crypt Roof:</b> 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 60; break DC 28.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Stone Door:</b> 6 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 90; break DC 32.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 3. 5, 9, or 11):</b>
 Everyone interred in the Kincep crypt rests in peace; however, Jaccobux
 may have attracted a few fellow undead to share his abode, either as 
servants, or just as unwanted squatters.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ghouls (4 or 12):</b> hp 13 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 119.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ghasts (2)</b>: hp 29 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 119.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>The
 pair of ghasts might be present with or without the ghouls, or there 
may simply be a few ghouls here. In either case, these creatures have 
tunneled their way into the crypt from the garden. They try to pick off 
lone characters wandering in the hedge maze, but they mount a massed 
attack if anyone tries to break into the crypt. They're not really very 
protective of the crypt, but they do find it a great opportunity to 
ambush intruders who are concentrating on breaking and entering.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spectres (2 or 4):</b> hp 45 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 232.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>The
 spectres use the same tactics as the ghouls, though they have no need 
of tunnels. They tend to lunge out at characters from inside hedges or 
trees, where they gain the benefit of cover. During the day, they remain
 in the hedge maze or near the crypt, where overhanging foliage shields 
them from the sun.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Entrance Hall and Foyer</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">All
 the ground-floor entrances to the house open onto this area, which 
features about a dozen suits of rusty armor, the main staircase, shelves
 crammed with knickknacks and thick with cobwebs, and many feral cats. 
Anyone walking in here not only finds a swarm of snarling cats (see the 
stable entry), but also hears chains rattling overhead (see the section 
on Jaccobux).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 3, 7, 8, 18): </b>In
 addition to the resident cats (Jaccobux tolerates the cats because they
 eat mice and rats, which Jaccobux fears might otherwise chew up his 
books), some of the suits of armor might actually be animated, and 
Jaccobux himself might make an appearance here if he knows intruders are
 on the property.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Cats (8 to 24):</b> hp 2; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 270.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>See the stables section.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated Suits of Armor (Medium animate objects, 4-10):</b> hp 31 each; see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 13.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 Jaccobux might animate these ahead of time if the party defeats his 
animated guardians outside, or he may enter the room under a <i>greater invisibility</i> spell and set them in motion while the PCs explore the place.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Jaccobux:</b> hp 102; see the About Jaccobux section.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b>
 As noted in the About Jaccobux section, Jaccobux first tries to scare 
intruders away from the mansion. If a pitched battle develops here, he 
sends waves of animated armor at the party, then uses <i>magic jar</i> and <i>suggestion</i> spells to persuade the group to leave.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Second Floor</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 area contained several suites of rooms for the family. It's mostly 
empty today, though the rooms contain reasonably good furniture covered 
with drop cloths. (Jaccobux never bothered to reopen this floor when he 
took up residence.) If Jaccobux has any living guests, they are housed 
comfortably here in one or two of the suites.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This also is the area where Jaccobux has his animated manacles do their thumping and rattling.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Library</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 room is the heart of the house. Before his death, Jaccobux gutted the 
whole third floor and crammed it with bookshelves that reach from floor 
to ceiling. He arranged the shelves into a seemingly random maze that 
serves to keep the books organized by subject and title. At the center 
of this book-lined labyrinth is Jaccobux's private study, which features
 a false skylight (several everburning torches provide steady light), a 
fireplace (unused since Jaccobux died), a desk, reading table, several 
trunks, and an armchair in which Jaccobux's desiccated body still lies. 
The trunks are mostly empty, though one contains Jaccobux's magic items 
and the other has adventuring gear. Jaccobux also has about 10,000 gp 
worth of coins and gems spread out among the trunks and concealed under a
 false bottom inside. It takes a Search check (DC 20) to find the false 
bottom.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 you decide that Jaccobux is in league with a local vampire, the 
creature's coffin is here, concealed behind a bookcase. It takes a 
Search check (DC 20) to find the coffin.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creature (EL 18):</b> If the PCs come here, Jaccobux meets (or confronts them) here. If attacked, he defends himself as best he can.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Negotiations:</b>
 If the PCs approach Jaccobux peacefully with the requisite peace 
offering of one book per four characters, he eagerly asks if he may see 
it. If the character holding it agrees, Jaccobux animates the book, 
which flies out of the character's grasp and opens for him to browse. 
While scanning the book, he mumbles to himself, entranced with its 
contents, no matter what they are. He is not as distracted as he 
appears, however, and responds normally to any attempted attacks. After a
 few moments, the book shelves itself with his other tomes.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If
 the PCs do not appear likely to threaten his library or anyone under 
his protection, the ghost is willing to talk with them at length (which 
is the only way Jaccobux has ever talked). Breaking into his monologue 
to direct the conversation is difficult, since Jaccobux is accustomed to
 talking mostly to himself. A typical "conversation" with Jaccobux might
 go something like this.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"So
 few people bother to read these days. The wisdom within the pages of 
these books far exceeds what any single person knows -- though I must 
modestly say that I come close. There is nothing like a good read to 
transport one to another time or place -- like the burning desert with 
the armies of the great general Phraxus, or the high seas with the 
famous Captain Mordeaux. Ah, what a grasp of military tactics those 
beings had! Do you know that no one has yet devised an effective counter
 for Phraxus's double-claw maneuver? You see, you take a third of your 
army and place it like so, taking advantage of hilly terrain, and 
another third here -- of course, he had a river to work with -- then the
 enemy comes in like this. . . ." </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jaccobux
 is quite happy to continue in this mode, on this topic or any other, as
 long as he is allowed to talk. He doesn't notice if the characters are 
bored, or even that they are there, once he gets going on a topic of 
interest to him.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Jaccobux
 can provide the characters with detailed information on a wide variety 
of subjects, in the manner of a sage. Retrieving such information from 
him requires either listening to his lecture (during which he regularly 
wanders off the topic) for at least 4 hours, or gaining his permission 
to peruse his library with a successful Diplomacy check. Should a volume
 disappear from his library, Jaccobux knows it just as a dragon would 
know that a single piece of jewelry had disappeared from his lair, and 
he is just as bent on getting it back.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics:</b> If a fight breaks out here, Jaccobux ceases trying to scare away the PCs and tries to kill them instead. He avoids using his <i>shadow evocation</i> spells in here, instead relying on <i>disintegrate</i> and<i> phantasmal killer.</i> (It's quite possible that the subject of the <i>phantasmal killer </i>spell
 might mistake the deadly phantasm for just another undead denizen of 
the mansion.) If Jaccobux decides to use his inhabit object power in 
here, the desk or the reading table is his best bet; they're both Large 
objects.</span></p>
