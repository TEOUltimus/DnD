<p align="center"><i>The Sinister Fountain includes encounters of EL 2-12, and it is suitable for use with any <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign.</i></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2011-19%20-%20Sinister%20Fountain_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p align="left">Many fountains are delights to behold. Elegant 
sculptures delight the eye and crystalline water fills the air with a 
soothing music all its own. This fountain, however, looks like something
 out of a nightmare. It resembles some emaciated fiend that weeps and 
drools foul-smelling liquid, and it sounds about as lovely as a leaky 
faucet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The sinister fountain actually is a conjuration device 
that was created to help guard an evil temple, tomb, or perhaps to serve
 an evil spellcaster. Although not portable, the fountain is a minor 
artifact.</p>
<p align="left">The device consists of a twisting pillar that supports a
 hideous demon head and three basins. The head sits atop the pillar and 
the basins project from the sides of the pillar. The whole thing has 
been sculpted from marble and inlaid with mother of pearl and alabaster 
so as to resemble bone. The head is the size of a fire giant's head and 
has goatlike horns. The upper basin is about 2 feet across and the two 
lower ones are about three times that size. A fountain very like this 
one is pictured on page 210 of the <i>Fiend Folio.</i></p>
<p align="left">The fountain generates its own water, which flows from 
the head's mouth and eyes, dribbles into the upper basin, and then into 
the lower basin, where it overflows into the next one and so on, until 
it reaches the lowest basin, where it seems to drain away. A plume of 
miasmal gas rises from the water, cloaking the whole affair in a swampy 
stench.</p>
<p align="left">For up to 3 rounds each day, the liquid flowing from the
 fountain's eyes is unholy water, and enough liquid flows to fill one 
standard vial from each eye during those 3 rounds.</p>
<p align="left">Up to six times each day (but no more than once each 
hour), the fountain can summon fourth one to four creatures (see the 
Creatures section, below).</p>
<p align="left">If uncommanded, the fountain produces creatures and 
unholy water at random intervals throughout the day. A character can 
control the fountain's functions by dumping a sacrifice into the upper 
basin and speaking the appropriate command word. The actual sacrifice 
required is left to the DM, but possibilities include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Enough of the user's own blood to deal 1d4 points of Constitution 
damage, drained directly from the user's body into the upper basin.<br><br></li>
<li>A magic potion or oil worth at least 250 gp.<br><br></li>
<li>Rare wine or other spirits worth at least 250 gp.<br><br></li>
<li>The ashes from a magic scroll that held at least one spell of 3rd-level or higher.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Liquids or small objects dumped into the upper basin 
eventually fall into the lowest basin, where they are destroyed. A 
Diminutive or smaller creature or object that enters the lowest basin 
for any reason must make a DC 20 Will save each round, or cease to 
exist. Larger things dumped into the fountain get wet and smelly but 
aren't otherwise harmed.</p>
<p align="left">The command words are long lost, but a DC 30 Bardic Knowledge or Knowledge (arcana) check will reveal them, as will a <i>legend lore</i>
 spell. A DC 25 Use Magic Device check allows a character to activate 
the fountain blindly (see the Use Magic Device skill), provided that the
 character also dumps the required sacrifice into the fountain.</p>
<p align="left">Since the fountain is a minor artifact, an<i> analyze dweomer</i> spell won't reveal anything about the fountain.</p>
<p align="left">The fountain has strong auras of conjuration magic and of evil. Magical effects from the fountain have a caster level of 20.</p>
<p align="left">Smashing can destroy the fountain. It is a Huge object with the following statistics:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fountain:</b> 6 in. thick; hardness 8; hp 120; break DC 30.</p>
<p align="left">If attacked, the fountain summons four creatures to 
defend it. It can do so even if it already has summoned creatures six 
times during the current day, and creatures it summons to defend itself 
don't count against its daily limit of six summonings. Once it has 
summoned creatures to defend itself, it cannot do so again for 1 hour.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs could stumble across the fountain during an 
adventure, or they might find it inside some foe's lair. Someone may 
also hire them to destroy the fountain.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">This unwholesome fountain looks like something out of a 
nightmare, or at least out of a macabre vision. The whole thing stands 
about as tall as fire giant. It resembles a twisted tree made from 
bleached bones. A hideous fiend head, horned and skeletal, tops the 
bizarre sculpture. Three basins that look like great claws protrude from
 the main trunk. Brackish water that smells like it came from the 
foulest swamp on the planet dribbles from the head's eyes and mouth. The
 fetid liquid plops into the basin below, and then overflows that basin 
and falls into the next until it finally reaches the bottom basin, where
 it drains away with a throaty gurgle. The whole thing sounds and smells
 like a slow-running sewer. A nasty-looking vapor, like steam from a 
swamp on a cold day, rises from the fountain.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">As noted earlier, the fountain can summon creatures. This works much like a <i>summon monster</i> spell, except as follows:</p>
<p align="left">A summoned creature always appears adjacent to the 
fountain (or as close to the fountain as possible if all the space 
adjacent to the fountain is occupied) and it cannot move more than 120 
feet from the fountain. If a summoned creature moves more than 120 feet 
from the fountain, or if something drags a creature out of range, the 
creature winks out of existence, just as if the summoned creature had 
been slain.</p>
<p align="left">As with any summoned creatures, various abjuration effects (including <i>dispel magic</i>) can send away creatures the fountain summons. As noted earlier, the fountain has a caster level of 20.</p>
<p align="left">A summoned creature emerges from the fountain as some 
kind of object that rapidly expands into the full-sized creature. This 
effect is purely for show. A creature that the fountain summons can act 
during the round when it appears, just as with a <i>summon monster</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left">Monsters that the fountain summons cannot use any summoning or teleportation abilities of their own.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bat Swarm (EL 2-6)</b></p>
<p align="left">The bats dribble from the statue's eyes as motes of 
black dust. The stream of water from the statue's mouth runs thick and 
dark, like water from an eroding hillside. The dust motes from the eyes 
turn into bats before they hit the upper basin. The stream of bats can 
last from 1 to 4 rounds, producing one swarm each round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bat Swarms (1-4):</b> hp 13 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 237.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The bats cluster around the nearest 
creature and continue attacking until the swarm is dispersed. If the 
fountain produces more than one swarm, newly arriving swarms seek out 
the nearest target that isn't already being swarmed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Assassin Vine (EL 3-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">A vine grows from one or both of the statue's eyes, then
 it detaches as it reaches full size. The flow of water from the 
statue's mouth turns a sickly green, like the scum on a stagnant pod. 
Long tendrils of weeds grow from the lowest basin and fill a 40-foot 
spread. The flow of assassin vines can last another round, producing one
 or two additional assassin vines on the following round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Assassin Vine (1-4):</b> hp 30 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 20.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The assassin vines can use the weeds growing from the fountain for their <i>entangle</i>
 powers. If the PCs cut away the weed or do something else to eliminate 
it, more weed flows from the lower basin. The weed continues to 
replenish itself each round so long as at least one assassin vine is 
within 120 feet of the fountain.</p>
<p align="left">The vines tend to grab whatever foes are closest and they favor smaller prey over larger creatures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gray Ooze (EL 4-8)</b></p>
<p align="left">The flow of water from the statue's eyes and mouth turns
 pale gray as if the fountain has suddenly become choked with silt. The 
water in the upper basin foams and emits an acrid stench, and the gray 
water in the lowest basin seems to overflow, dumping one or more gray 
oozes onto the ground. The fountain produces up to four oozes, either 
all at once, two at a time, or one a round, as the DM sees fit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Gray Oozes (1-4):</b> hp 31 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 202.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> A character needs a DC 15 Spot check to 
notice the ooze in the flood of water from the lower basin; if the 
characters miss, the ooze automatically hits one character for slam and 
acid damage. Once a battle starts in earnest, the oozes tend to attack 
the nearest available target.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bearded Devil (EL 5-9)</b></p>
<p align="left">The flow of water from the statue's eyes turns to a 
scalding stream of polluted water. Anyone in a 40-foot cone extending 
from the fountain's front takes 1d4 points of fire damage. A DC 15 
Reflex save reduces the damage by half. In addition, a creature that 
fails its Reflex save might become poisoned. The creature must make a DC
 13 Fortitude save or suffer 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. This 
poison's secondary effect is 1d4 points of Constitution damage.</p>
<p align="left">The devils appear as grotesque manikins that shoot from 
the statue's mouth, then splash into the upper basin, where upon they 
jump out and are full size before they hit the ground. The devils appear
 one at a time for 1 to 4 rounds. The scalding water continues for as 
long as devils pop out of the fountain.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bearded Devils (1-4):</b> hp 45 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 52.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Remember that the devils are immune to fire and poison.</p>
<p align="left">A single devil uses its battle frenzy ability, and then 
attacks the physically weakest-looking character it can reach. The devil
 begins by using its glaive, but switches to natural weaponry if its 
foes move into adjacent spaces (where the glaive cannot reach). If the 
devil discovers it can hit its chosen foes fairly easily, it might 
abandon its glaive attacks and use natural weapons so as to bring its 
beard attack into play.</p>
<p align="left">If multiple devils come from the fountain, the new 
arrivals try to jockey for position before attacking. (Their 
teleportation abilities don't work because they're summoned creatures.) 
The devils shy away from combat with physically powerful characters and 
try to attack the weaker looking first. None of the devils can summon 
other devils (again because they are summoned creatures).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Salamander (EL 6-10)</b></p>
<p align="left">The flow of water from the statue's eyes and mouth turns
 to a stream of molten lava. Anyone touching the lava takes 2d6 points 
of damage per round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion 
(such as when a character climbs into the lower basin), which deals 20d6
 points of damage per round.</p>
<p align="left">Damage from the lava continues for 1d3 rounds after 
exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt 
during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>
<p align="left">The salamanders appear as white hot worms that shoot 
from the statue's mouth, then splash into the upper basin, whereupon 
they jump out and are full size before they hit the ground. The 
salamanders appear one at a time for 1 to 4 rounds. The lava flows for 
as long as salamanders pop out of the fountain. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Average Salamanders (1-4):</b> hp 58 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 219.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Upon emerging from the fountain, a 
salamander strikes with its spear at one target and lashes with its tail
 at another. If it grabs with its tail, it takes -20 on its grapple 
checks so it can go on attacking with its spear while it holds a victim 
in its coils. If it cannot hold onto a foe, it happily goes back to 
stabbing and tail slapping. If several salamanders appear, one or two of
 them might concentrate on victims in their coils (making normal grapple
 checks) while the rest try to keep the victim's allies from attacking 
the grappling salamander.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hellcat (EL 7-11)</b></p>
<p align="left">The hellcats emerge as lumps of glowing coal that fall 
from the statue's eyes and mouth. Meanwhile, the basins seem to fill 
with oil and burst into flame. These flames shed bright light in a 
30-foot radius and shadowy light an additional 30 feet beyond that.</p>
<p align="left">The "coals" transform into tiny hellcats that fall to 
the upper basin's rim, and then leap to the ground, where they achieve 
full size by the time they land. A maximum of three hellcats can emerge 
from the fountain in a single round. If four hellcats appear, one 
arrives a round after the others (or one hellcat can come initially, 
followed by three others, or two can arrive each round).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hellcats (1-4):</b> hp 60 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 54.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>Hellcats are invisible in light, and 
characters who cannot see invisible things see the glowing coals 
seemingly evaporate as they fall. Seen or unseen, once a hellcat 
arrives, it looks for a lightly armored character to attack.</p>
<p align="left">The flame effects in the basins are similar to <i>continual flame</i>
 effects, except they're brighter and they last only so long as a 
hellcat is within 120 feet of the fountain. The flames can be dispelled 
as spell-like effects from a 20th-level caster.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hellwasp Swarm (EL 8-12)</b></p>
<p align="left">The wasps dribble from the statue's eyes as grains of 
golden sand. The stream of water from the statue's mouth turns golden, 
like a stream of honey or tawny wine. However, the fountain exudes a 
smell like rotten fruit baking in the summer sun. The grains of dust 
from the eyes turn into wasps before they hit the upper basin. The 
stream of wasps can last from 1 to 4 rounds, producing one swarm each 
round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hellwasp Swarm (1-4):</b> hp 93 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 238.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The wasps use the same tactics as the bats.</p>
