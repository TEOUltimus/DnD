<p align="LEFT">A brightly painted storefront with a sign that resembles
 a big perfume bottle looks like any other small business. Still, not 
everyone who goes in and out seems like the type to buy perfume. Perhaps
 the sweet scent of perfume masks something insidious.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal Sweetflower, a halfling, founded the Alabaster 
Bottle about ten years ago. Hillal is sixty-two years old, and he spent 
more than thirty years as a modestly successful adventurer. When no 
promising heroic escapade was at hand, Hillal became a pickpocket and 
occasionally a cat burglar. He never became rich or famous, but he also 
never got killed or caught. As the years rolled by, Hillal felt his 
reflexes getting slower and he also noticed various aches and pains 
accumulating. He realized he couldn't keep living by his wits and 
decided to retire in comfort.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal started looking for any clues that might lead him
 to a fortune, and his efforts eventually paid off. He and a few 
companions found and looted a hidden vault stuffed with rare jewels, 
statues, incense, and perfumes. Hillal was thrilled with his newfound 
wealth and inspired by the sheer value of the incense and perfume. He 
took his share and used part of it to become an apprentice perfume 
maker. While learning to concoct scents, he discovered that he also had a
 talent for alchemy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">After working for a time as a merchant trading in exotic
 oils, resins, and fragrant woods used in perfume and incense, Hillal 
opened the Alabaster Bottle. After a few years in the business, Hillal 
brought in two young relatives to help him in the shop. Hillal serves as
 a mentor to the youngsters as they pursue their own careers as 
explorers and rascals. He hopes having access to his advice and also 
some income from legitimate jobs will keep them from putting themselves 
in danger (by turning to crime) as he once did.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Today, Hillal sells a few alchemical items useful to 
adventurers in addition to incense and perfumes. He makes many of his 
wares, but purchases and resells most of what he offers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Alabaster Bottle fits best into a big city where the
 residents can afford luxury goods. The shop also might be located in a 
smaller community where trade routes cross or at one end of a key 
mountain pass. Hillal likes security, so if he's located in a smaller 
community, there's likely to be a fortress or other military 
installation in the area. Alternatively, Hillal might be located 
someplace where wandering halflings congregate from time to time. The 
PCs might encounter Hillal while shopping for alchemical items, or 
something else might steer them Hillal's way:</p>
<ul>
<li> One or more of the items from Hillal's big score are part of a 
bigger item (perhaps a magic item or even an artifact). The PCs might 
obtain a few of the other pieces and subsequently find clues that lead 
them to Hillal. Someone also might hire the PCs to track down all the 
pieces.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal sold his share of the loot a long time ago; however, he might remember who bought it.</p>
<ul>
<li> An infamous halfling brigand is on the run after a botched job and 
the PCs are hired to track down the miscreant. Hillal might be suspected
 of harboring the fugitive or of fencing stolen goods for the criminal. 
In fact, some may suspect him of being the brigand.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal still gets around (see Visiting the Alabaster 
Bottle), but he's not connected with any criminal activities. He is, 
however, well connected with the local halfling community and might have
 useful information for the PCs.</p>
<ul>
<li> Hillal hasn't entirely given up his taste for seeking lost 
treasures. He has developed some information about a hidden cache of 
treasure guarded by many traps and creatures. Hillal approaches the PCs 
about going after this treasure.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal might decide to come out of retirement for this 
venture, but he's more likely to insist that his young relatives come 
along to gain experience. These characters probably will need 
considerable protection during the venture.</p>
<ul>
<li> Hillal needs help making or receiving a delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-17%20-%20The%20Alabaster%20Bottle_files/dx0417vv_potions.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="323" width="200">Hillal
 might own a share in a caravan that needs guards, or he might need 
couriers to carry a letter or package. In either case, the cargo is 
valuable enough to draw attention from thieves. It might also be rare 
enough to serve as a rare component that an evil spellcaster would like 
to steal or something that a dragon or other ferocious monster would 
like to eat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Alabaster Bottle (EL 6-10)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Hillal opens for business midmorning for six days a 
week and he closes up sometime after dusk. He doesn't keep precise 
hours. If he and his assistants feel like sleeping in, opening might be 
delayed an hour or two, and if Hillal has a particularly challenging 
project to tend -- or finds himself involved in an enjoyable 
conversation with a customer -- the Alabaster Bottle might remain open 
far into the night. Early customers who don't want to wait for Hillal to
 rise can summon the staff with a hand bell kept near the door, though 
Hillal has been known to lock up the bell when he doesn't care to get up
 early.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal hasn't quite lost his halfling wanderlust, and 
occasionally he literally packs up half the shop and takes it on the 
road to attend some distant fair or market.</p>
<p align="LEFT">First-time visitors are sure to notice the shop's sign 
(see below). A step through the door reveals a business that reflects 
its owner's quirks:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">A three-dimensional sign that looks like a perfume 
bottle with an egg-shaped base and a graceful neck marks this small 
business. The blue-white bottle stands in contrast to the low, wooden 
building behind it. The place sports bright red and yellow paint and a 
round door flanked by round windows. A niche to the right of the door 
holds a sizeable brass hand bell attached to the building with a short 
length of chain.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">A long look through a window or a step through the door reveals more:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The storefront is merely a wall, perhaps half again as 
tall as a human. A grassy courtyard lies beyond the door. To the left 
stands a low-slung wagon painted in the same red and yellow as the 
storefront. A single building closes off the other two sides of the 
courtyard. The wing behind the courtyard is two stories high, with a row
 of round windows on the second floor.</p>
<p align="LEFT">An open wing stands opposite the wagon. A short flight 
of wooden steps leads a foot or two above the level of the courtyard to a
 plank walk backed by rows of shelves crammed with myriad little bottles
 and other sundry objects. A broad eave shelters the walk and shelves. 
The wall behind the shelves sports a row of round windows and a 
rectangular door, split so that the top can be opened separately from 
the bottom.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal uses the wagon for his trips to distant locales. 
It is fitted with panels and an awning on one side to allow Hillal to 
use it as a sales stall with living quarters behind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The building contains the following areas:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Main Wing: </b>The main wing stands opposite the 
wagon's parking spot. It consists of the open air sales area described 
above and a rear storage area and workshop.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The bottles on the shelves in the sales area contain 
mostly perfumes. Each is fitted with a glass stopper with a long glass 
rod attached. A customer can withdraw the stopper to take a sample of 
the merchandise. The bottles are intended for sampling only. When 
someone wishes to purchase a scent, a staff member must take it from a 
locked compartment under the shelves. Hillal also stores scented oils 
and various kinds of incense on the shelves. These can be purchased 
right off the shelf.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Hillal sells all of the alchemical items listed in the <i>Player's Handbook, </i>plus other alchemical items that might be available in your campaign (such as those from the <i>Arms and Equipment Guide</i>).
 Most of these items are dangerous, and Hillal keeps them locked in the 
back. The staff sells these items to patrons who ask for them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The workshop has a bench crammed with alchemical gear 
and storage bins for raw materials. Finished alchemical items are kept 
in a locked cabinet. Hillal or whatever staff member is currently in 
charge has the keys to the back room and the compartments under the 
shelves.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rear Wing:</b> The wing behind the courtyard contains
 living quarters for Hillal and his assistants. The three halflings live
 on the upper floor. The lower floor is a stable and kennel. This wing 
has exits that open onto an alley behind the shop, and a connecting door
 leads to the workshop behind the sales area.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures: </b>Hillal, his nephew Brammon, his niece 
Elysia, or all three are on duty during business hours. When the shop is
 closed, Hillal usually is home alone while the youngsters pursue their 
own interests. Hillal also keeps three riding dogs for security. When 
the shop is open, the dogs usually lie out of sight under the sales 
area. When the shop is closed, the dogs are either in the kennel or 
upstairs with the halflings. Hillal also has three war ponies.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Riding Dogs (3):</b> hp 13 each; <i>MM</i> 272<i>.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The dogs are trained for guarding (see the Handle Animal skill description).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>War Ponies (3):</b> hp 13 each; <i>MM</i> 277<i>.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The ponies are trained for combat riding (see the Handle
 Animal skill description). When Hillal needs animals to pull his wagon,
 he buys or trades for additional animals.</p>

 Hillal and his young relatives play the role of affable merchants when 
in the shop. If trouble arises, they try to diffuse things as best they 
can. They'll fight, however, to protect themselves and their wares. In a
 battle, they call the dogs and take the fight to the enemy. They use 
the dogs to flank opponents and bring their sneak attack abilities into 
play. Hillal and Brammon use their tumbling skills to keep their 
distance from dangerous foes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Elysia begins a battle defensively by casting <i>cause fear </i> on an opposing fighter. After that she casts <i>divine favor</i> on herself or <i>bless</i> on herself and her allies before trying to make a sneak attack.</p>
