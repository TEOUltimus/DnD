<p align="LEFT">Wonderful smells rise from this fortresslike building 
day and night. The place is famous for its excellent bread and sweet 
cakes that are shaped like stone buildings. A trio of lookalike dwarves 
runs the place -- a fact that helps explain the unusual cakes. If you 
think dwarf bakers are just too strange to be believed, you might be 
right. Most of Torgart's Undermountain Bakery lies underground and out 
of sight, and who knows what lurks beneath the surface?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A trio of dwarf cousins -- Einjar, Josgar, and Dajmarda 
Torgart -- owns and operates Torgart's Undermountain Bakery. The three 
also have a small number of young dwarves in their employ. The cousins 
share similar features, and they're all about the same age, leading many
 people to think they're siblings, or even triplets.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A one-story stone building with a flat roof houses the 
business. On the roof, the Torgarts have erected an artificial mountain,
 which serves as the bakery's sign. The false mountain is made from 
canvas panels stretched over a wooden framework and painted to make the 
mountain look fairly real. The bakery gets its name from its most 
unusual sign. Unfortunately, the whole affair tends to literally come 
apart in the wind. Einjar Torgart, who is responsible for maintaining 
the sign, often grumbles about the "chaos of the weather on the 
surface."</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2011-23%20-%20Torgart%27s%20Undermountain%20Bakery_files/dx1123vv_bakery_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="159" width="191">The
 three Torgarts offer excellent bread baked fresh several times each 
day. Because many of their customers seem to have a sweet tooth, the 
Torgarts also offer a few confections. Most of these come in the form of
 chewy cakes studded with rock candy and made in the shapes of buildings
 or natural rock formations. The Torgarts don't care for light, airy 
confections. The bakery also sells meat pasties (a savory pastry 
consisting of a flaky crust filled with chopped meat and vegetables), 
and assorted dried fruit and meat (suitable for use as trail rations). 
All these items remain available throughout the day, though a few baked 
items usually are gone from the shelves by the end of the business day. 
Each day, the Torgarts also prepare one selection of soup or stew. The 
selection varies daily. The Torgarts hang a ladle outside the shop to 
indicate that the daily soup or stew selection is still available. When 
the day's supply is gone, the ladle comes down. The Torgarts serve their
 soups and stews in bowls made from hard, fairly waterproof bread. A 
bread bowl can hold soup for about 45 minutes before getting soggy. Stew
 takes a little longer to soak through.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Torgarts also make their ovens available to the 
local residents who need to bake or roast meals. Officially, they charge
 a small fee for the service, but they generally waive it for people who
 are truly needy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Visitors generally consider Torgart's Undermountain 
Bakery a peculiar business. Most people don't think of dwarves as 
skilled bakers, and the sight of flour-dusted dwarves scurrying about 
making and selling bread strikes visitors as quite odd. Strains of 
dwarven working songs (hearty but not always on key) emanating from the 
basement add to the eccentric atmosphere.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In fact, there's more to the Undermountain Bakery than 
meets the eye. The bakery actually has three underground levels. The 
first holds the ovens and storage areas for the bakery. The second is a 
series of snug apartments for the Torgarts and their staff. The third 
and lowest level contains a shrine to Moradin, complete with the 
requisite forge. When not busy baking, most of the Torgarts are working 
at the forge, secretly making weapons and armor. Exactly why the 
Torgarts pose as bakers while making implements of war is left up to the
 DM. Perhaps the Torgarts simply enjoy working with metal, or perhaps 
they are outcasts from their clan and have been forbidden (for some 
reason) to work stone and metal. Or perhaps the bakery is a secret 
dwarven outpost or safe house, and the Torgarts are surreptitiously 
keeping watch for some threat to the dwarven community.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The bakery is located on the fringes of a dwarf enclave 
in a large town or city in which the main population is human or elf. 
You can also place it in a smaller community located a short distance 
from a major dwarven settlement. In this latter case, the Torgarts and 
their employees should be among the very few dwarves in the community --
 or perhaps the only dwarves there.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The player characters might visit the bakery to buy 
provisions for an adventure, or some event might draw them there. Here 
are a few possibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li> A mysterious but diminutive figure swathed in a cloak or hood steps
 in and does the PCs a favor. The favor can be minor, but it should be 
memorable. Perhaps he helps the PCs catch a thief who has stolen an item
 from them. Or perhaps he steps up to vouch for the characters when they
 get into trouble. Or perhaps he gives the party an important piece of 
information in exchange for a favor to be named later.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">In any case, the mysterious character wants the PCs to 
respond in kind. They merely need to stop at Torgart's Undermountain 
Bakery and pick up a special order. The character gives the PCs a locked
 box decorated with dwarven runes to present as payment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The box contains a modest amount of wealth -- a few 
hundred gold pieces at most. The special order is a crate full of bread 
and cakes, and the PCs must deliver it secretly to a specified location.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The whole business might be innocuous -- perhaps the 
mysterious character is merely laying in supplies for a surprise party. 
Or perhaps the baked goods conceal an item of value such as a piece of 
treasure, a weapon, or a document. The PCs' errand might go well, or 
they might be assailed by stealthy enemies. It all depends on what the 
DM decides the Torgarts really are up to. The three Torgart cousins are 
sincerely lawful good, so they will not be involved in any dastardly or 
immoral dealings. Nevertheless, they might have secrets they wish to 
keep.</p>
<ul>
<li> The PCs find an unusual item hidden in their rations. It might be a
 small trinket or gem, or it could be a small tool or weapon. Upon 
investigation, they discover that the rations came from Torgart's 
Undermountain Bakery. (The PCs might have purchased the item themselves,
 or bought it from some merchant who resells the Torgarts' wares.) The 
hidden item might have wound up inside the rations by mistake, or it 
might be part of a secret shipment that somehow went astray.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs meet a desperate -- or perhaps mortally wounded -- dwarf who
 begs them to take him (or her) to Torgart's Undermountain Bakery. The 
hapless dwarf might be a relative of the Torgarts' who has become lost, a
 rival sent to deliver a challenge, or a secret messenger or agent who 
almost failed a mission.<br><br></li>
<li>A government official who has authority over the place where the 
Torgarts have their bakery has become suspicious of the dwarves. So she 
hires the PCs to infiltrate the place and discover what's going on 
there.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Bakery</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Torgarts are open for business every day of the 
year, from dawn until dusk. Early mornings are their busiest times -- 
that is when most customers come in to buy fresh bread for the day. The 
view from outside isn't very encouraging, however.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The squat building has a plain stone facade broken only 
by a single wooden door bound with black iron and a few slitlike 
windows. A fortress or prison might look more inviting. Atop the roof is
 a towering artificial mountain whose craggy flanks seem to tremble in 
the breeze. Occasionally, an eddy of wind brings the mixed scents of 
fresh bread and coal smoke. </p>

<p align="LEFT">Inside, the first-time visitor finds a little more 
charm. The text below assumes a visit fairly early in the morning, when 
the shelves are still full.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="LEFT">Inside, the atmosphere feels warm and dry, and the 
comforting aroma of wholesome baking fills the air. Still, the hint of 
cool and damp that rises from the stone walls and floor keeps the place 
from feeling stuffy or overheated.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The bakery seems to have only a single room. The open 
serving area is backed by a low counter with a green marble top. Neat 
pyramids of rolls and loaves are arrayed along the counter, and at each 
end stands a charcoal brazier topped with a steaming cauldron and 
flanked by piles of deep bread trenchers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Behind the counter stand rows and rows of wooden shelves
 filled with loaves of bread, stacks of rolls, and amazing-looking 
confections made in the shapes of stone buildings or natural rock 
formations. A fresh-faced but portly dwarf lass dressed in a spotless 
white apron, a loose smock, and a ridiculously floppy white beret serves
 customers from behind the counter. She seems to have an infectious 
smile. A few young dwarf males, also very chunky and dressed in similar 
clothes, assist by retrieving goods from the back shelves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One can't be sure, but strains of some sort of jolly song seem to rise from somewhere below the stone floor.</p>

experienced of the three cousins. She is nominally in charge of the 
bakery, and she serves as the manager, salesclerk, and goodwill

smock, which makes her look portly and causes her to jingle when she 
walks. She keeps her weapons handy behind the counter.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Neither Einjar nor Josgar thinks much of being a baker, 
but they both have resolved to do as good a job as possible. Einjar, 
with his knowledge of architecture, is responsible for the bakery's 
building-shaped confections. Both of the male cousins are 
characteristically taciturn for dwarves, and they wear dour expressions 
that bespeak their dissatisfaction with running a bakery instead of 
pursuing more appropriate activities. They tend to be abrupt with 
customers, though they stop short of being rude. However, the bakery's 
customers tend to be indulgent toward the two male cousins because of 
the quality of their wares.</p>

<p align="LEFT">A middle-aged human female steps up to the counter. "A 
loaf of peasant bread, please, and a dozen of those adorable little 
building cakes," she says in a bubbly voice. "Do you have any shaped 
like temples? Oh, I just can't get over how cute they are!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Just townhouses today," says the dwarf behind the 
counter with a surly expression. He slaps a loaf of bread down hard on 
the smooth surface, then begins boxing up cakes while muttering to 
himself. "Temples now, they want," he says, pushing back the floppy 
chef's hat that has drooped down over his eyes. "I can make temples to 
the Soul Forger, but they probably want those frilly, prissy little 
elven temples. Hmmph."</p>
<p align="LEFT">He ties the box closed and slams it onto the counter. "That'll be 5 silver," he says gruffly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The woman pays, then leans over the counter to pinch the
 dwarf's cheek, eliciting an expression of sheer horror. "Thank you so 
much! I'll be back tomorrow!" she sings merrily and heads for the door.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The dwarf reflexively reaches to his hip where a weapon 
would normally hang, then seems to remember himself. "What are you all 
looking at?" he growls at the other gathered customers and turns to the 
next in line.</p>

<p align="LEFT">As noted earlier, the Torgarts work at their forge when 
not resting or baking. They sing or chant working songs while shaping 
metal to help cover the sounds of their hammers.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>All the cousins play the role of 
harmless baker to the hilt and wave off any suggestion that something 
else might be afoot at the bakery.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In a fight, all the cousins prefer melee combat, though Dajmarda usually takes a moment to cast a <i>bless</i>
 spell before entering the fray. The cousins usually meet the foe 
head-on while their warrior employees try to work their way around the 
enemy's flanks.</p>
