<p align="left">These fields of ripening grain broken by stands of fruit
 trees have a certain rustic charm, but the fortified tower on the 
highest spot in the fields and the stone cairns scattered here and there
 hint of a history that belies this calm scene.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The area called the Kingsfields was once the site of a 
great, three-day battle during which a royal army defeated a much larger
 invading force. Very little is known about the battle, except that the 
carnage was terrible, and that on the final day the commanders on each 
side (both monarchs of their countries) died. The opposing monarchs' 
names are left up to you -- choose an identity for each that is 
appropriate for your campaign.</p>
<p align="left">Legends about the battle abound, but the truth is that 
the defending army, using superior scouting and reports from refugees 
fleeing the invaders, cut the enemy's lines of supply and ambushed its 
advance force, defeating nearly a third of the foes before the main 
battle was joined. Late on the second day, the invaders' main force 
arrived, and the two armies fought for several hours until night fell. 
The invaders, who had many troops that could see in the dark, tried to 
continue the fight, but the defenders feigned panic and lured the night 
fighters into a series of deep pits lined with stakes, where many 
perished. In the ensuing confusion, the defenders withdrew into a great 
redoubt they had constructed and there awaited the final assault, which 
commenced before dawn on the third day. By noon, the attackers had 
exhausted themselves, and a determined sally from inside the redoubt 
routed the attackers. The attacking monarch was slain in the confusion, 
but several loyal retainers recovered the corpse and spirited it off the
 battlefield.</p>
<p align="left">As evening fell, the invaders' second-in-command, an 
unpleasant wizard who called himself Finis Whitehand, rallied some 
troops and ordered them to don clothing and armor from some of the 
casualties from the victorious side. Finis was a necromancer of great 
power, and he animated several corpses (also dressed in enemy gear) to 
serve as a sort of honor guard. After dark, Finis and his company 
bluffed their way into the redoubt and slew the victorious commander. 
Just for spite, Finis immediately cast a <i>soul bind </i>spell on the 
fallen monarch's corpse and gave the focus for the spell (a big black 
sapphire) to a lieutenant, who promptly teleported away with it. The 
rest of Finis's company was slain, and Finis himself fell victim to an <i>imprisonment</i>
 spell. The victors, however, concealed the necromancer's true fate by 
pretending that Finis had merely been slain. Today, a polished skull, 
purportedly the necromancer's, is displayed in a shrine on the 
battlefield.</p>
<p align="left">The defeated monarch was eventually resurrected, but 
court intrigues, combined with the ruinous cost of the failed invasion, 
eventually led to the overthrow of the monarchy and end of the ruler's 
line.</p>
<p align="left">Finis still lies imprisoned under the battlefield today,
 but only a select few know that the infamous wizard is still there. A 
servant of Heironeous keeps watch over the battlefield to this day, 
ostensibly to maintain a modest shrine erected where the redoubt once 
stood, but really to ensure that no one casts a <i>freedom</i> spell and releases Finis Whitehand.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">The PCs may have visited the battlefield already. Today,
 most of the area is farmland, and it doesn't seem special -- except for
 the shrine of Heironeous. Characters might cross the battlefield many 
times without realizing its significance. However, the PCs might take 
new interest in the site after hearing a few choice tales or witnessing a
 bizarre event, as noted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs hear an old tale (or bard's performance) detailing the final
 battle of the redoubt. In this story, the first rank defenders broke up
 the attack by hurling themselves on the attackers' swords, effectively 
disarming them and leaving them vulnerable to a counterattack that drove
 them back upon the swords in their own rear ranks. The counterattack 
rolled through the attackers in a wave. The battle ended with the 
opposing monarchs facing each other in single combat outside the 
redoubt. The defending monarch won the fight, forcing the foe to 
surrender, but a spell treacherously cast from the ranks of the supposed
 prisoners laid the monarch low and the defeated army fled before the 
outraged defenders could get their revenge. Today, anyone who swears an 
oath at the tomb of the betrayed monarch (which lies in the shrine of 
Heironeous erected on the site of the final duel) becomes answerable to 
the spirit of the slain monarch. Should one break the oath, the wrath of
 the slain monarch will fall on the forswearer.<br><br> This tale has a 
few elements of the truth, but those at the battle spread this tale 
after it to keep Finis Whitehand's true fate hidden. The defending 
monarch's tomb is located in the shrine of Heironeous on the 
battlefield, but the place doesn't have any power to enforce oaths. The 
place has a few secrets, though; see the next section.<br><br></li>
<li> The PCs encounter an NPC party having a night on the town. The NPCs
 seem to have plenty of money to spend. One of the NPCs drunkenly boasts
 that they struck it rich by clearing out an old crypt located under the
 battlefield. When pressed for details, the group claims that the losing
 side in the battle negotiated lavish burials for their dead before 
quitting the field. Undead warriors loaded with magic and jewels still 
lurk under the battlefield waiting for the day when they'll be called to
 attack again.<br><br> An evil cleric named Jochiim Blackdawn started 
this tale. The NPCs are merely hired actors. Jochiim suspects Finis 
Whitehand's true fate, and he wants to encourage local adventurers to 
search the battlefield and perhaps uncover the wizard's prison.<br><br></li>
<li> Strange lights have been seen on the battlefield at night. These 
lights are in fact moonlight and starlight reflecting off the weapons of
 ghostly troops who fight the battle over and over again when the stars 
are right.<br><br> Indeed, strange lights can be seen on the battlefield
 on some nights. These, however, are lantern archons sent to help guard 
the secret of Finis Whitehand's imprisonment.<br><br></li>
<li>Packs of undead stalk the battlefield at night, menacing the farms 
in the area. The undead wantonly trample crops and slay both livestock 
and people. Some say that these creatures are the spirits of looters and
 camp followers who once despoiled the fallen after the battle long ago.<br><br>
 Undead do indeed roam the battlefield. They're not long-dead spirits, 
however, but newly created undead creatures. Jochiim Blackdawn has been 
creating them to make the tales he has been spreading seem true.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Exploring the Battlefield</b></p>
<p align="left">Though mostly just farmland, the Kingsfields have a few 
features worth investigating, as noted in the boxed text below, and in 
the sections that follow:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">These rolling fields of ripening grain look much like 
farmers' fields everywhere, as do the small orchards on the hilltops. A 
few features seem out of place, however. Concentric circles of low 
mounds and shallow ditches are covered with brambles. A small, round 
tower stands on a higher mound rising from the center of these works. 
The tower has a crenellated top with a slender spire in the center. A 
banner showing a fist clutching a lighting bolt flies from the spire.</p>
<p align="left">Here and there amid the grain rise cairns of moss-covered stones.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>The Keep</b></p>
<p align="left">The keep actually is a small temple of Heironeous built 
on the ruins of the defenders' redoubt. The banner flying over the 
central tower bears the holy symbol of Heironeous. If the player 
characters don't recognize the symbol, they can identify it by making a 
DC 10 Knowledge (religion) check.</p>
<p align="left">The temple's upper floors include an armory, storerooms, and tiny bedchambers.</p>
<p align="left">The main floor has a central chamber containing an 
altar. The altar is a marble slab decorated with warriors locked in 
battle. The altar radiates overwhelming abjuration magic. The source of 
the magic is Heironeous himself. Through an ancient agreement with 
several clerics who undertook perilous quests on his behalf, Heironeous 
blocks all divination effects created or used by any evil creature if 
they are cast in or directed into the temple or any of the space below 
it. The effect remains in place so long as someone (anyone) prays to 
Heironeous for at least 10 minutes every 4 hours. Various clerics of 
Heironeous have kept this bargain for years and years.</p>
<p align="left">A secret door behind the altar hides a staircase that 
leads to a cramped chamber where a polished human skull stands on 
display within a cube made up permanent <i>walls of force</i> and lit by an <i>everburning torch.</i></p>
<p align="left">The skull is purportedly that of Finis Whitehand, but it
 in fact it belongs to a cleric of Heironeous who helped dream up the 
scheme to keep Finis Whitehand's imprisonment secret. The site where the
 <i>imprisonment</i> spell was cast lies some 20 feet behind this 
chamber's back wall. Layers of stone, brass, and iron fill the actual 
spot. Thanks to the altar above, no one has detected the presence of the
 imprisoned wizard.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 15-17):</b> The resident priest at the 
shrine is Aramus Silverbrow, who serves as the caretaker of the 
battlefield and shrine. Aramus spends most of his time keeping watch 
over the battlefield from the tower top. He also prays at the altar 
every 4 hours to maintain the ward.</p>
<p align="left">Aramus has squad of lantern archons to assist him. He may also have one or two astral devas as well.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Aramus tries to play the role of a 
kindly old gent -- perhaps a retired old campaigner. His feathery wings 
make him look otherworldly (which he is). Sometimes, he hides his wings 
under his cloak, but doing so tends to make him seem very 
broad-shouldered and menacing.</p>
<p align="left">Aramus poses no danger to the PCs unless they attack him
 or try to dig into the wall blocking access to Finis Whitehand's 
prison. Aramus knows the whole, true story of the battle. He wasn't 
there himself (he's not that old), but as guardian of the shrine and 
caretaker of the battlefield he has heard the story in minute detail. He
 does not tell the PCs what he knows unless he's sure they can be 
trusted with the secret, and then only if he deems it necessary to his 
own task of making sure nobody frees Finis Whitehand. He does his best 
to deflect any queries the PCs might make about the true history of the 
battle, though he won't tell any outright lies. Read or paraphrase the 
following if the PCs encounter Aramus peacefully.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Welcome, my friends," says the old man, a beatific 
smile wreathing his features. "It is good to have visitors with whom to 
pass the time. What brings you to this field of battle? Do you crave 
tales of past glory, or do you come to pay homage to Heironeous?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the characters ask about the battle, or about any of 
the specific details they have heard in town about it, Aramus tries to 
deflect their questions, as follows.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Battles are fought for many reasons, my friends, but 
the result is always the same -- death for countless brave souls. 
Whether they take up arms to defend home, family, and country against 
invaders, or for some holy cause, or to gain a military or economic 
advantage for their own countries, blood stains the ground red for days,
 and the loss of life impoverishes both attacker and defender.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Pause here for dramatic effect and to let the PCs ask 
questions or make comments. Aramus is off again with the following at 
the slightest provocation:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"This battle was between two mighty nations. The land 
upon which you stand belonged to the defending country, whose monarch 
was wise indeed. For a time, it seemed as though his ingenious 
strategies might win the day with a minimum of bloodshed, but the 
attacking monarch was both wily and determined. On and on the battle 
raged. As soldier after soldier fell, the land grew red with blood, and 
the cries of the wounded and dying mingled with the clash of arms. But 
still the attackers came, fighting on into the night. When the battle 
finally ended, both monarchs were dead, but the defenders had held their
 ground. This shrine marks the spot where the defenders made their final
 stand, to remind others of the high costs of war.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Here's another good place to pause to let the PCs get a word in edgewise. Again, Aramus plunges on:</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"I suppose neighbor will always take up arms against 
neighbor, and nations will always clash. But it is the soldier who pays 
the cost, is it not? Was there honor and glory in the Seven Heavens for 
those who died here? I like to think so, but surely the gates of the 
Heavens must be bursting with the souls of so many dead heroes by now. 
Perhaps the true hero is the one who finds another way. So when you 
leave this place, take with you that lesson -- in the end, the death of 
all these soldiers bought only a peaceful field and a shrine to their 
memory."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the characters ask about the skull, Aramus answers as follows.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Folk say that this is the skull of an officer on the 
attackers' side, but since I was not there, I cannot say. Whose skull it
 is, however, is not really important. It serves as a reminder of the 
folly of making war on one's neighbors for material gain. What, after 
all, did this poor soul's sacrifice achieve? Only to warn others not to 
interfere in their neighbors' business."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the characters ask Aramus about undead in the area, he responds as follows.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Do undead walk this field at night? Nay, not that I 
have ever seen. Such tales have been spread by superstitious villagers 
for many years. If undead have walked this land, it was surely before my
 time." </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">In a fight, Aramus usually takes to the air and softens up the opposition with <i>order's wrath, holy smite, sound burst, </i>and<i> searing light </i>before
 using his Spring Attack feat to fly in, attack with his greatsword, and
 fly out of reach. (Normally his full plate armor would prohibit using 
Spring Attack because it is heavy armor, but the armor is mithral, so it
 functions as medium armor.) He might use <i>dispel magic</i> to 
suppress magic items that are making this difficult. If his foes seem to
 damage him easily, or if he has trouble attacking, he uses <i>divine power</i> to boost his combat power and maybe <i>entropic shield</i> for defense. If necessary, he uses his Combat Expertise feat to improve his Armor Class a little.</p>
<p align="left">Aramus's lantern archon servants aren't much of threat 
to anything that can mount a serious challenge to Aramus, but they 
gamely hang in there, using their aura of menace and light rays to best 
effect. They tend to aim their light rays to disrupt spells or to chip 
away at heavily armored foes (who tend to have poor touch ACs). Foes 
might just find the lantern archons pretty irritating.</p>
<p align="left">The astral devas, if present, do their best to keep up 
pressure on the foe. Generally, they hang back and use magic when Aramus
 is attacking and move in to attack when Aramus is using spells from a 
distance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Earthworks</b></p>
<p align="left">These areas are what remains of the deadly pit traps the
 defenders used during the second day of the battle. The stakes placed 
in them rotted away long ago, but the diggings themselves remain 
visible. Movement is hampered in these areas, thanks to the brambles 
(creatures with the woodland stride class feature can move at normal 
speed).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 6-8):</b> Characters poking around 
these areas during the day might flush out a pack of ghouls. Jochiim 
Blackdawn has created these creatures and turned them loose on the area.
 During the day, they creep into the old pits and trenches to hide from 
the sun.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ghouls (7-12):</b> hp 13 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 118.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>The ghouls are accustomed to simply 
overwhelming their victims, and they attack by mobbing the nearest 
characters, three or four to a target. They attempt to grapple and 
establish holds, then claw and paralyze their victims. The ghouls attack
 separately (each making its own grab and attempting to establish a 
hold). Any ghoul that doesn't establish a hold moves on to the next 
likely target. The ghouls don't have the improved grab ability, so their
 grapple attempts provoke attacks of opportunity from their targets. If 
turned, a ghoul tries to flee down a trench.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Cairns</b></p>
<p align="left">These mounds of earth covered with stones mark the graves of all the soldiers killed in the battle. They have each received a <i>hallow</i>
 spell. Each cairn has at least one stone that gives an account of the 
dead interred there. Not all the names of the dead were known at the 
time of the burials (especially among the invaders), but the 
inscriptions list the numbers of people buried under each cairn. </p>
<p align="left"><b>The Orchards</b></p>
<p align="left">Places on the battlefield that prove too steep or too 
rocky to grow grain (mostly hilltops) have been planted with fruit 
trees. Most of these stands of trees remain untended and deserted except
 at harvest time, but one of the larger orchards has a hut with wattle 
and daub walls and a thatch roof. Until recently, an old farmer called 
Jarvis lived here, tending the trees around his hut and in the other 
orchards as well.</p>
<p align="left">When Jochiim Blackdawn came to the area seeking 
information about Finis Whitehand, he assumed Jarvis's identity and 
moved into his hut. The evil cleric killed the old farmer (who promptly 
became a ghoul, thanks to Jochiim's <i>create undead</i> spell). Now 
Jochiim lives in the hut, pretending to care for the fruit trees. 
(Luckily for him they don't need much attention this time of year.) He 
actually spends most of his time poking around, trying to find some clue
 about Finis Whitehand's true fate. He doesn't know that the wizard was 
imprisoned, but he's collected enough hints to realize that there's 
something fishy about the story of Finis Whitehand's demise. He steers 
clear of Aramus and his assistants.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 11-13): </b>Jochiim dwells in the hut 
disguised as Jarvis. A gang of spectres sometimes attends him. Jochiim 
has used his considerable powers of persuasion (and an occasional use of
 his power to rebuke or control undead) to form a shaky alliance with 
these monsters. The spectres give Jochiim some measure of protection and
 vice versa.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Jochiim uses his disguise skill to pose 
as Jarvis. He uses his armor's glamer power to make it look like peasant
 clothes. He keeps his shield in the hut and his mace in his <i>Heward's handy haversack</i>.
 He does his best to appear as a decrepit old man, but he won't hesitate
 to attack anyone who seems vulnerable. He begins each day with an <i>undetectable alignment</i> spell.</p>
<p align="left">If the PCs make peaceful contact with Jochiim, he pumps 
them for information about the shrine while trying to pique their 
interest in investigating it further.</p>

<p align="left">If he can see a fight coming, Jochiim prepares by casting <i>freedom of movement, spell immunity</i> (<i>magic missile, fireball</i>), <i>shield of faith, </i>and <i>magic circle against law.</i> Once combat begins, he uses <i>confusion, flame strike, </i>and<i> searing light</i> as soon as he can. If his spectres are on hand to help, he'll bolster them against turning attempts and convert his spells to <i>inflict wounds</i> spells so he can heal damage to the spectres. He is fond of using <i>mass inflict light wounds</i> so that he can damage living foes while healing his undead allies.</p>
