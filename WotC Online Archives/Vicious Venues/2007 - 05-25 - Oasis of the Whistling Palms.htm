 oasis offers a refuge from scorching desert heat. Weary travelers can 
relax in the shade, slake their thirst, wash away sand and dust, and 
perhaps enjoy a few native fruits. On a long desert trek, a verdant 
oasis can literally be a lifesaver. Oases beckon to travelers, but many 
also have permanent residents. A large oasis on a heavily used caravan 
route might support a village or town. A more isolated oasis might host 
just a few souls or a colony of wild beasts. Sometimes hostile creatures
 move into an oasis. After all, it's easier (and much more pleasant) to 
find prey in the cool shade of an oasis than on the trackless, burning 
sands.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Some oases develop sinister reputations thanks to their 
residents. The Oasis of the Whistling Palms is one of these. Locals 
visit the place only when they absolutely must. When camped there at 
night, the locals are careful to stay within a crude stockade built by 
unseen hands and close their ears to enticing music that plays among the
 trees. In the morning, the wise visitor picks some fruit from the 
trees, fills his canteens, and leaves quickly.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The djinni Dunyazad calls the Oasis of the Whistling 
Palms home. She shares the place with a pride of big desert cats. 
Dunyazad comes from a long line of djinn who are allied with brass 
dragons. Over the years, Dunyazad has made many jaunts onto the Material
 Plane, often at a brass dragon's behest, and she has come to like the 
place. Dunyazad particularly loves the desert with its open vistas and 
(occasionally) powerful winds. Though she loves to fly over the desert 
for hours at a time, she also enjoys resting among the springs, pools, 
and fruit trees at the oasis.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Dunyazad loves music and is a bard of some skill. She uses her <i>major creation </i>power
 to create flutes, whistles, and other wind instruments. She also 
harvests some wood from the oasis to make a few instruments from scratch
 and sells her handiwork to the occasional merchant who passes her way. 
When she first came to the oasis, Dunyazad literally played cat and 
mouse with the big cats that lived there. Her magic and ability to fly 
kept her out of serious danger. Over the years, the cats have learned to
 tolerate Dunyazad's presence and even think of her as one of their own.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Although she values her privacy, Dunyazad also likes to 
receive visitors from time to time, and she understands that most 
residents of the Material Plane simply must rest and recuperate at oases
 to recover from the hardships of desert travel. To accommodate 
visitors, Dunyazad built a log stockade to serve as a refuge from the 
cats.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Visitors or no, Dunyazad likes to sit up in the 
moonlight and play her flute, sending haunting music floating over the 
desert. Because Dunyazad usually plays as she flies, the music seems to 
come from the trees, and thus has given the place its name.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As presented here, the oasis is best placed in a classic
 sand sea as a patch of cool green amid acres and acres of sun-blasted 
sand dunes. The place could work just as well in any fairly arid zone, 
such as a rocky desert or even a prairie. In any case, the oasis has the
 only open water and tall trees for a hundred miles or more. It lies far
 from any settlements and well off the beaten path. The PCs might come 
upon it while searching for a ruin or when attempting to take a shortcut
 across the desert. Something specific, however, might draw the PCs 
there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brigands or thieves have snatched something valuable (or perhaps 
dangerous) and fled over the desert. The PCs are hired to track down the
 culprits.<br><br> Perhaps the thieves are making for a hideout 
somewhere in the hinterlands, or perhaps they simply wish to lose any 
pursuers in the trackless desert. The PCs might catch up with their 
quarry at the oasis, or they might be obliged to rest at the oasis 
awhile before resuming their pursuit. In either case, Dunyazad most 
likely is willing to let the conflict play out between the two groups, 
though she's good-hearted at her core and likely to turn on anyone who 
acts truly villainous in her presence.<br><br></li>
<li> A merchant wants to hire guards for an expedition bound for a 
secret place in the desert. If the PCs take the job, the merchant 
refuses to tell them their destination. At least one rival tries to 
bribe the PCs to learn where the group is headed. Once in the desert, 
the PCs and their employers have to use many tricks to throw off 
pursuit.<br><br> The merchant is headed to the oasis to purchase musical
 instruments from Dunyazad. He has promised to protect the djinni's 
privacy and refuses to reveal his destination or the source of his 
wares. Dunyazad's work is top quality, but not enough to explain all the
 interest in the trip. Perhaps the merchant has another secret he's 
hiding, such as the location of a lost treasure hidden in or near the 
oasis, or perhaps the merchant's rivals simply have allowed their 
curiosity to get the better of them.<br><br></li>
<li> A bedraggled group of adventurers staggers into a settlement at the
 desert's edge. They say they recovered a great treasure under the 
desert sands. They lost all their loot, however, at a haunted oasis 
where disembodied voices drove them mad and unseen hands snatched away 
their goods.<br><br> The PCs might be on hand to hear the tale, but most
 likely they hear it secondhand. The "haunted" oasis might be Dunyazad's
 oasis, and the "ghosts" could have been Dunyazad using her voice, 
music, and spells against the group. Dunyazad might have seized the 
treasure, or, more likely, the adventurers fell to squabbling over the 
loot and Dunyazad, disgusted, drove them off. Alternatively, the 
incident might have occurred elsewhere. If the PCs investigate, the 
information they get points toward the Oasis of the Whistling Palms, 
which tends to figure heavily in any local tale.<br><br> If the PCs go 
after the treasure, Dunyazad is inclined to let them have it, or most of
 it. Other creatures, however, might want the loot for themselves. 
Almost anyone from rival adventurers to a blue dragon or two might want 
to compete for the treasure. <br><br></li>
<li> Rumor has it that a long-lost city has emerged from the desert's shifting sands.<br><br>
 The Oasis of the Whistling Palms might simply lie on the route to the 
city, or it might be a vital landmark for locating the place. The rumor 
itself could prove true, or perhaps an efreeti or other evil creature 
has planted it to draw victims to its lair. Dunyazad could warn 
characters before they fall into the trap or help them recover after 
they escape and perhaps help them prepare for a second foray. Of course,
 the rumor could be true, and Dunyazad's advice could prove valuable to 
characters preparing to explore the place.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Oasis (EL 10-13)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Read the text below as the PCs first approach the oasis.
 The text assumes the PCs visit during a clear day and that the oasis 
lies in a hot, sandy desert.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The sky overhead looks as clear and blue as the finest 
sapphire. Not a single cloud mars its azure beauty, except over one 
place not so far ahead. Through the shimmering heat, a patch of green is
 visible. Trees stand tall against the clear sky, and thick underbrush 
grows in the shade below. A towering cumulus cloud hangs over the place,
 suggesting open water below.</p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The oasis is about a mile wide, with two pools and 
several springs. Rivulets of clear water snake out from beneath the 
trees and melt into the sand after a few hundred yards. The place also 
has several rocky outcrops with hollows and caves where the resident 
cats make their lairs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Dunyazad has selected a shady spot at one end of the 
oasis for the stockade. She built the stockade from tree trunks about a 
foot thick and some 20 feet long. They're set in a square about 50 feet 
on a side and sloped slightly outward to discourage climbers. There is a
 wooden gate that can be tied shut with heavy ropes.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Inside lies an open, sandy space plus a few posts for 
tying up animals. Two rings of stone on the sand offer spots to build 
campfires.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The stockade is about as far as one can get from the 
cats' lairs and still be inside the oasis. It's also about a hundred 
yards from the nearest water source. Folks can barricade themselves 
inside and be safe from the cats, but they must survive on the food and 
water they bring with them. Dunyazad planned it that way. She welcomes 
the occasional guest, but doesn't want them to stay too long.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Read or paraphrase the following if the PCs decide to stop at the oasis.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The water glistens in the sunlight, and the palms 
provide welcome shade. A soft breeze rustles the palm branches, and it 
seems to carry with it a song, like a breath on the warm air.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>"Rest and set your cares aside<br></i><i>Here beside the whistling palms.<br></i><i>Let your conscience be your guide,<br></i><i>And sleep beneath the whistling palms.</i></p>

</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted earlier, Dunyazad shares the oasis with a pride
 of great cats. These animals might be any of several kinds, depending 
on how dangerous you want to make the oasis.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Cheetahs (3-5):</b> hp 19 each; <i>MM</i> 271.<br><b>Lions (6-10):</b> hp 32 each; <i>MM </i>274.<br><b>Dire Lions (6-10):</b> hp 60 each; <i>MM</i> 63.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> The big cats prefer to attack after 
sunset, moving in quickly and quietly. They instinctively attack weaker 
foes first -- if they can reach them. Once they select a target, they 
keep attacking until the foe is dead. They withdraw into the brush if 
reduced to 25% of their original hit points or less.</p>

 Once every 10 minutes, Dunyazad can transform herself into a whirlwind 
up to 50 feet tall, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 5 feet wide at 
the base. She can remain in whirlwind form for up to 7 rounds; see page 
114 in the <i>Monster Manual</i> for more details. <br><b>Air Mastery (Ex)</b> Airborne foes take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against Dunyazad.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> Dunyazad has a mischievous streak and 
seldom leaves strangers alone. She also has no intention of allowing 
bandits or evil monsters to use the oasis as a base for raiding 
settlements and trade routes nearby. To that end, she usually flits 
around invisibly and studies strangers carefully.</p>
<p align="LEFT">She sometimes tests a newcomer's mettle by casting <i>charm person</i> and luring the subject deep into the oasis for a conversation about his group's business at the oasis. She also might create a <i>persistent image </i>of
 a group of desert brigands digging up (or burying) a chest crammed with
 treasure and then binging on drink, falling into a deadly fight, or 
simply slinking off into the shadows. Dunyazad finds strangers' 
reactions to this image quite instructive.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Occasionally, Dunyazad sows dissention among strangers 
by using her Sleight of Hand skill to pickpocket key items from them. 
She may switch valuable items between characters or steal them 
altogether (though she usually doesn't do that unless she plans to 
attack).</p>
<p align="LEFT">In a fight, Dunyazad reads a <i>displacement</i> scroll and whistles for the oasis cats -- she has trained them to answer her call. She then casts <i>glitterdust</i>
 on the foe and uses her bardic music to inspire courage in the cats. 
While maintaining the effect, Dunyazad uses her Spring Attack feat to 
deliver slams to whichever foe seems most dangerous. After a few rounds,
 Dunyazad stops maintaining the inspire courage effect and uses <i>suggestion</i> or <i>Tasha's hideous laughter</i> on physically dangerous foes. Against spellcasters, she uses <i>sound burst</i>
 aimed to miss the cats, if possible. Once all the cats are killed or 
driven off, Dunyazad assumes whirlwind form and charges through the 
foe's ranks.</p>
