<p align="left"><i><img src="2004%20-%2007-16%20-%20Murky%20Hollow_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></i></p>
<p align="left">Locals take care to avoid this marshy valley at night, 
when strange vapors and weird apparitions rise from the very ground to 
befuddle the unwary visitor, or even choke off life. By day the valley 
seems unnaturally green and silent, as though something terrible has 
gone to ground in the surrounding wood and lies, brooding, until it can 
go forth again at dusk. What power lurks in the murky hollow?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">The murky hollow is a shallow valley that sometimes 
floods during heavy rains. Throughout much of the year, a narrow stream 
flows through the bottom, but the stream dries up in late summer and in 
winter. A series of mineral springs and small geysers, however, keep any
 number of small pools and bogs full of water year round. When the 
stream flows, all these small bodies of water are connected.</p>
<p align="left">The vapors the locals fear are usually nothing more than
 normal fog coming from a few of the hot springs (and the occasional 
geyser eruption). During the day, the springs and geysers merely make 
the place seem cloyingly humid, but at night the air temperature drops, 
giving rise to banks of shadowy fog.</p>
<p align="left">Tales of weird apparitions and inexplicable deaths in 
the hollow have a basis in fact. Rotting vegetation lying in the 
streambed gives off marsh gases that sometimes spontaneously ignite, 
thus creating natural will-o'-wisps. A few of the geysers vent massive 
clouds of carbon dioxide (and traces of other gases) from time to time 
as well. This gas is beneficial to the plant life in the hollow, but 
people and animals caught in an eruption can literally drown before 
they're aware of the danger. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Choking Gas Cloud Trap: </b>CR 5; gas; timed trigger; no reset; gas cloud 15 feet high; Search DC --; Disable Device DC --; Cost:<i></i>--.</p>
<p align="left">An eruption releases a cloud of gas 15 feet high and 
3d4x10 feet in diameter. The cloud drifts on the wind for 1d4 hours 
before finally settling in some low area (the gas is heavier than air). 
The gas isn't normally visible, but it contains some water vapor and 
might form a light fog (partial concealment, 10% miss chance) at night 
or in cold weather. The gas is mostly odorless, but it might have a 
slight hint of sulfur smell. Gas eruptions can occur any time of the day
 or night.</p>
<p align="left">Characters most often encounter the gas by walking into a
 stagnant cloud of the stuff, but they may encounter a cloud on the move
 (a cloud typically moves at a speed of 10-30 feet a round in the 
direction the wind blows). In the worst case, a cloud could settle over 
the party and then stay in place.</p>
<p align="left">Upon first encountering the cloud, characters can make a
 DC 25 Survival check to notice telltale signs of the cloud (heavy air, a
 hint of rotten egg smell, animals in distress) or a DC 30 Spot check to
 notice visible signs of the cloud's presence (usually dead or dying 
animals). A successful Survival check reveals the cloud's basic nature. A
 successful Spot check reveals some clue, but provides no real 
information about the cloud, but a DC 20 Knowledge (nature or geography)
 check reveals the existence of such clouds.</p>
<p align="left">Creatures in a cloud can speak, and they seem to breathe
 normally, at least as first. In fact, once inside the cloud a character
 effectively begins holding her breath because there's no oxygen in the 
cloud. After 1d4 rounds of involuntarily holding her breath, a character
 can make a DC 15 Wisdom or Survival check to notice the problem. If 
this check fails, the character noticed nothing unusual until she must 
make her first Constitution check to keep holding her breath (see page 
304 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide)</i>, or until someone else 
mentions the problem. In addition, the gas snuffs out any nonmagical 
flames the party carries. Torches, lanterns, or candles flicker 
immediately and go out 1 full round later.</p>
<p align="left">The gas isn't toxic, and surviving an encounter with a 
cloud merely requires getting out before passing out. A character can do
 this by moving to the edge of the cloud or getting more than 15 feet 
above the ground. A character could accomplish the latter by finding a 
hill to scale or climbing a tree.</p>
<p align="left">After becoming aware of the hazard the gas clouds pose, a
 character can make a DC 15 Survival check to avoid further contact with
 them. Doing so entails avoiding low ground and staying aware of the 
prevailing wind. Movement on the local or overland scale (see Chapter 9 
in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>) is reduced to one half while avoiding gas clouds.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to the natural hazards, the hollow could be 
home to any number of mischievous or hostile creatures, as noted in the 
next section.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">A narrow country road crosses the hollow, so the 
characters could pass through it on their way somewhere else. The road 
connects two villages, and local people pass through the hollow fairly 
often, but usually only during daylight. The characters also might be 
drawn there in response to any number of rumors or tall tales, as noted 
below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hollow was once home to a fairly rare species of tree, locally 
called blackwood, which crafters highly prized for making musical 
instruments and other fine carved items. The last blackwood tree was cut
 down more than a generation ago, but recently a sprig of blackwood with
 green leaves turned up in the marketplace in a village not far from the
 hollow.<br><br> This could be pure invention, or it could be true. In 
the latter case, the treant Diobemun (see the Creatures section) is 
involved.<br><br></li>
<li>Travelers foolish enough to visit the hollow at night and lucky 
enough to escape with their lives report any number of odd sights and 
sounds, including strange, eerie lights in the darkness, insane giggling
 or maniacal laughter (or both), and long lines of ghostly figures 
stalking through the fog.<br><br> The eerie lights are genuine, but 
they're merely swamp gas burning. The giggling and laughter are most 
likely fanciful inventions, though a few mischievous local boys (or 
gnomes) may be behind those incidents. The lines of ghostly figures also
 might be mere imagination; however, they're most likely gnomes (see the
 Creatures section).<br><br></li>
<li>Most victims of the hollow appear to have choked to death. Often 
they're found lying right on the road or path they were using, but, from
 time to time, they apparently ran wildly through the surrounding woods 
before staggering to a halt and then dying on the spot. No one has ever 
found footprints or other signs of an attacker at the death sites, 
though there have been signs of scavengers from time to time.<br><br> 
Most of the incidents described here can be attributed to gas eruptions,
 but perhaps the allips that haunt the hollow hold responsibility for at
 least a few of these deaths.<br><br></li>
<li>The hollow is a great place to go hunting. Everyone knows that the 
biggest deer hide in there. They know they're safe. Whatever lurks in 
the hollow attacks only people.<br><br> Actually, animals frequently die
 in gas eruptions, and the PCs can verify that just by asking around. A 
DC 15 Gather Information check uncovers several tales of local people 
finding dead animals (choked to death) in the hollow. Still, Diobemun 
the treant doesn't bother animals.<br><br></li>
<li>Years ago, a caravan laden with gold and gems was lost in the hollow
 when orcs ambushed it. The drivers in charge of the wagons and pack 
animals carrying the loot tried to avoid capture by moving into the 
surrounding woods, and they would have made it if not for a flash flood 
that scattered and drowned them. Their spirits still haunt the place and
 will do so while their precious cargo remain undelivered.<br><br> This 
tale could be true. The spirits could be allips (see the next section) 
that originally lost their lives foolishly trying to save their cargoes 
instead of themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>A Visit to the Hollow </b></p>
<p align="left">The hollow could exist almost anywhere, but the following text assumes a hilly or mountainous area.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">The rutted track that winds through these hills might be
 called a road, but it would take a generous soul to do so. Where big 
rocks aren't sticking up just far enough to make a wheel take a 
spine-jarring hop (or stub a toe), there are deep ruts just wide enough 
to twist an ankle or make a cart sway and dance like a drunken sailor. 
It seems as though some relief lies ahead. The track slopes down into 
some kind of valley or hollow between the hills. Trees and all manner of
 undergrowth lie thickly there. Some sort of light mist seems to cloak 
the ground under the leaves.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The track continues through the wooded hollow and out 
the other side for a distance of perhaps a mile and half. The stream 
mentioned earlier (if it's flowing at all) lies roughly in the center of
 the wood, and it must be crossed via a ford. The track proves 
reasonably firm and dry, though still both rocky and rutted at the same 
time, but the ground on either side is positively soggy.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to occasional gas eruptions (see the previous section), PCs could encounter any of the following in the hollow.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Get Out of My Wood! (EL 7)</b></p>
<p align="left">The treant Diobemun has dwelt in the hollow for at least
 a decade, drawn in part by the lush plant growth that the gas eruptions
 engender.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Diobemun, Treant: </b>hp 66; see page 244 in the<i> Monster Manual,</i> except alignment neutral.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Diobemun has developed a deep loathing 
for nonplant life, and for humanoids in particular. She doesn't even 
care for other treants, or for other plant creatures. Diobemun considers
 most treants foolishly sentimental and far too prone to forgive 
destructive activities by humanoids, and she thinks most other plant 
creatures are brainless louts.</p>
<p align="left">Diobemun spends most of her time in the depths of the 
wood, where she tends a vast number of saplings she has grown from seed.
 Her charges might include blackwood trees or other varieties once 
thought extinct. If so, she probably found the seeds preserved in one of
 the hollow's bogs and coaxed them to grow.</p>
<p align="left">Characters are most likely to meet Diobemun when they're
 attempting to avoid gas clouds, since doing so involves innumerable 
detours. The treant sometimes also hides near the track passing through 
the hollow just so that she can keep an eye on humanoids passing through
 the area. </p>
<p align="left">Diobemun knows she can't just attack everyone she meets,
 but she's not above steering gullible newcomers toward areas filled 
with quicksand (see page 88 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>), 
particularly if they inquire about lost treasure or wrecked wagons. She 
seethes with rage if she suspects visitors of mistreating the forest in 
any way. </p>
<p align="left">Read or paraphrase the following aloud if the characters encounter Diobemun while they are not abusing the forest.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">The sun filters down through the branches of the trees, 
producing a dappled pattern on the leaf-covered forest floor. A light 
breeze ripples through the branches, making a sound that almost 
resembles human speech. Or perhaps it really is a voice.</p>
<p align="left">"Miserable rootless things, lurching around the forest," mutters something just to the side of the path.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the characters challenge the voice, Diobemun shakes her branches and greets them.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"I said, it's miserable, that fruitless thing of 
searching around the forest. I am Diobemun, protector of the wood, 
friend of forest creatures, maintainer of the balance, slayer of the 
stupe -- I mean, player of the lute. What brings you to invade -- I 
mean, visit -- our forest today?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the PCs tell Diobemun that they seek treasure, she 
tries not to express her disgust as she directs them to the nearest 
deadly danger.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Ah, you seek the shiny things that your kind craves so 
much. Are you sure you would not prefer to gambol about the clearings, 
drink from the cool streams, and enjoy the ever-present beauty of nature
 instead? No? Well, in that case, you must travel down that path to your
 left -- the one that leads into the dark cave over there. Go through 
the tunnel until you emerge in a clearing with a waterfall. Skirt the 
edge of the clearing until you reach a large stone, about your height, 
then turn right into the clearing. It's a little soft in there, but 
what's a little mud to adventurers? Anyway, when you feel yourselves 
begin to sink, you'll know you're in the right place. Just stand there 
until the hidden magic platform lowers you into the cavern below."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">In battle, Diobemun prefers to ambush her foes by hiding
 in a likely spot and pretending to be a tree (treat as a normal Hide 
check, with the usual +16 for a treant hiding in a forest). She begins 
by animating two trees on opposite sides of the enemy, and then she uses
 her trample attack against anyone who doesn't attempt melee combat with
 the trees. She assumes that such foes are spellcasters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>A Parade of Ghosts (EL 5-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">Groups of forest gnomes occasionally search the hollow 
for rare wood and herbs. They also extract salts and trace minerals from
 the geysers and hot springs. They keep to themselves for the most part,
 and they move quietly through the trees on moonlit nights, when there's
 less chance that they'll be spotted or disturbed. Their trips have 
given rise to many tales of ghosts in the hollow.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day -- <i>dancing lights, ghost sound</i> (DC 12), <i>prestidigitation, speak with animals</i> (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). Caster level 1st.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bardic Knowledge:</b> The forest gnome leader may 
make a bardic knowledge check with a bonus of +5 to see whether he knows
 some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, 
or noteworthy places.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bardic Music:</b> The forest gnome leader can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Countersong (Su):</i> The forest gnome leader can 
counter magical effects that depend on sound by making a Perform check 
for each round of countersong. Any creature within 30 feet of him that 
is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack can use the 
bard's Perform check result in place of his or her saving throw if 
desired. Countersong lasts for 10 rounds. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Fascinate (Sp):</i> The bard can cause a single 
creature within 90 feet that can see and hear him to become fascinated 
with him. The bard's Perform check result is the DC for the opponent's 
Will save. Any obvious threat breaks the effect. Fascination lasts 5 
rounds. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Inspire Competence (Su):</i> The bard can use his 
music or poetics to aid an ally with a task. The ally must be within 30 
feet and able to see and hear him, and he must be able to see the ally. 
The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular 
skill as long as he or she can hear the bard's music. The effect lasts 
as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. The bard
 can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a 
mind-affecting ability.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Inspire Courage (Su):</i> Any ally who can hear the 
bard receives a +1 morale bonus on saves against charm and fear effects 
and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. The effect 
lasts for 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear him.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Forest Gnome Traits:</b> The forest gnome leader has a
 +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions, a +4 dodge bonus 
against giants, and a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds, 
goblinoids, orcs, and reptilian humanoids. He also has a +4 racial bonus
 on Hide checks, which improves to +8 in a wooded area (already figured 
into the statistics given above). In addition, a forest gnome leader has
 the innate ability to use <i>pass without trace</i> as the spell (caster level 3rd). </p>
<p align="left"><b>Bard Spells Known</b> (3/2; 0% chance of arcane spell failure): 0 -- <i>daze</i> (DC 12), <i>detect magic, light, mage hand, message, prestidigitation; </i>1st -- <i>cure light wounds, lesser confusion</i> (DC 13), <i>magic weapon.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Possessions: </b>Masterwork studded leather, masterwork longsword, masterwork composite shortbow (+0 Str bonus), <i>cloak of resistance +1,</i><i>wand of cure light wounds</i> (23 charges), scroll of<i> animate rope</i>, scroll of<i> disguise self, </i>scroll of<i> endure elements, </i>scroll of<i> glitterdust,</i> scroll of<i> remove fear.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> The gnomes prefer to stick to business, 
but they keep a sharp lookout for Diobemun, and that makes them a little
 bit jumpy. Their first reaction upon meeting the PCs is to scatter, and
 after that they try to hide. Read or paraphrase the following when the 
gnomes first hear or spot the PCs.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Intruders!" shouts a voice from somewhere ahead. "Run 
for it, everyone!" The sound of small, running feet fills the air, along
 with bumps and muffled grunts, as though the fleeing creatures had 
bumped into one another.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">If the PCs pursue, the bard tries to negotiate.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">"What do you want with us?" says a gnome with brown hair
 and skin. "Are you looking for foxglove? It's a little late in the 
season, but I have some in my bag. Or maybe you came for rue. Or 
wormwood? Oh, don't tell me you came for bilbane! It blooms only once a 
year, and that's not till next week! You wouldn't take our bilbane, 
would you?"</p>
<p align="left">"Sir," says another gnome, touching the leader's 
shoulder. "They probably want blackwood. Why don't you just tell them 
where it is and save us a lot of trouble? It's obvious they're going to 
take it; we may as well surrender it before they torture us."</p>
<p align="left">"Quite right, Terbin," says the first gnome. "Very well,
 you have us. It's over there, across the clearing and through the trees
 about 100 yards. If you catch sight of a tree that seems to move out of
 the corner of your eye, pay no attention. It's just a magical defense 
around the grove of incredibly valuable, worth-a-king's-ransom blackwood
 trees. When you get there, say 'I've come for blackwood and I'll do 
anything to get it.' That deactivates the magical protection on the 
trees."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The gnomes are really just trying to get rid of the PCs 
by directing them toward the treant. No blackwood trees are in that 
area, but if the PCs obey the gnomes or ask Diobenum about blackwood 
trees, she flies into a rage and attacks.</p>
<p align="left">The gnomes really don't want to fight, but if pressed, 
they try to keep their distance as long as possible by fleeing through 
the woods and firing their arrows. The bard uses <i>grease</i> spells and his scroll of <i>glitterdust</i> to slow down the party.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Not Just a Babbling Brook (EL 5-7)</b></p>
<p align="left">A small group of allips infests the hollow. If you've 
decided that the rumor about the treasure caravan is true, the allips 
arose from the caravan drivers who foolishly lost their lives trying to 
save their cargoes. Otherwise, they're the spirits of equally foolish 
locals who spent too much time in the hollow and died in gas eruptions.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Allips (2-4):</b> hp 26 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>, page 10.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics: </b>The allips prefer to lurk in the trees, 
just within the 60-foot range of their babble ability. They babble for a
 round or two, then move in to make touch attacks. The allips are drawn 
to gas clouds, and they might show up to complicate things when the 
party is dealing with a cloud. Since the allips are undead, the gas 
doesn't affect them at all. Such an encounter is far more deadly than 
either the cloud or the allips alone, so a +50% ad hoc XP award is in 
order.</p>
