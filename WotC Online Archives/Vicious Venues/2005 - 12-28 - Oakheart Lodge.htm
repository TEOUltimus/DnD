<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2012-28%20-%20Oakheart%20Lodge_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p align="LEFT">Oakheart Lodge appears to be nothing more than a 
charming hunting lodge, newly built and ready to host a weary traveler 
or a party of fun-seeking nobility. Still the lodge has a reputation for
 being a perilous house to visit. Perhaps it is a place best avoided, or
 perhaps its secrets are well worth plumbing.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The lodge appeared in its clearing almost overnight, 
like a mushroom in the fall. A young nobleman, Enikki du Orinwood, had 
the place built. Enikki is a half-elf and a member of a minor noble 
family that is well entangled in the human politics in the region where 
Enikki lives. He is the product of a diplomatic marriage that helped 
cement ties between the du Orinwoods and the local elven nobility. 
Enikki spent most of his early years being groomed for life in both 
human and elven courts, but he always had a yearning to return to 
nature. Upon the death of his human parent (the DM is free to decide 
whether that was his mother or his father), Enikki received a modest 
inheritance, which he promptly spent on the lodge.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Oakheart Lodge is Enikki's retreat from court life, and 
the young nobleman has settled in for a long stay -- a vacation of 
sorts.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Oakheart Lodge was built for hunting, so DMs can place 
it anywhere wild game can be found. Most likely, it's in a deep forest, 
but it also could be located in a hilly or mountainous region, or 
perhaps on a riverbank or in an area of badlands. In any case, tall 
trees surround the lodge's site.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The lodge has been deliberately built off the beaten 
track, though it is most likely within a day's ride of a human town or 
an elven settlement with a population of 2,000 or less. (The town should
 be big enough to provide basic supplies, but not so big that the 
surrounding area is overrun with people.) Unless the PCs are hunting or 
searching for something else in the vicinity, they aren't likely to 
stumble on the lodge by accident (but it's possible, especially if the 
PCs become lost while traveling in the wilderness).</p>
<p align="LEFT">More likely, some task or rumor will draw the PCs to the lodge's neighborhood. Here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li> A plane-hopping wizard has brought an entire palace to the 
countryside nearby, and he has many vicious guards who attack anyone 
approaching the place. Nobody knows why the wizard has come. Some say he
 seeks an ancient treasure; others say he seeks blood and souls for an 
awful experiment. No matter what the wizard's reasons for coming, his 
arrival does not bode well for the area.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This is nothing but a wild rumor spurred by the lodge's 
rapid construction -- and Enikki's bad habit of shooting at anything 
that moves (see below). If the PCs ask around, they can find some local 
workers who helped build the lodge. The workers most likely encourage 
the PCs to pay "the young lord" a visit, but perhaps they don't warn 
them about Enikki's overzealous hunting.</p>
<ul>
<li> A green dragon (or other dragon appropriate to the terrain) has 
begun raiding and laying waste to towns and settlements. If the PCs seek
 out this dragon, they might find the lodge first. Enikki probably has 
at least seen the dragon and could offer the PCs vital help in tracking 
it down -- in return for being in on the kill and getting a cut of the 
loot. <br><br></li>
<li> Someone has built a dwelling on the site of an ancient burial mound
 and set the dead walking. The unfortunate owner was quickly killed, but
 the dead still haunt the night. Doom surely will follow if the 
situation isn't set right.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">This one could be true, or it could just be a wild 
rumor. In the former case, Enikki is happy to hunt undead; he's also 
more than happy to help the PCs delve beneath the lodge and destroy the 
undead or put them to rest again.</p>
<ul>
<li> A crisis has arisen in the human or elven courts (or both), and the
 PCs have been dispatched to retrieve Enikki from his wilderness retreat
 so that he can help deal with the problem. It's also likely that some 
third party is on hand trying to assassinate Enikki -- or at least keep 
the PCs from reaching him.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Lodge (EL 6-8)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The lodge is a picture of bucolic elegance -- at least until Enikki begins shooting.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="LEFT">A wooded slope gives way to a broad clearing, perhaps a 
bowshot across, at the top. Tall grass and weeds make it difficult to 
see, but many trampled paths cross the thicket, as though many people or
 animals have visited the place recently. A rambling log home about two 
stories tall, with a roof of shiny black slate and bright green 
shutters, is just visible over the tops of the weeds. At least four tall
 trees shade the dwelling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The clearing is 200 yards across, with the lodge roughly
 in the middle. The grass provides partial concealment (20% miss chance)
 if the viewer must look through 10 to 20 feet of grass, and total 
concealment beyond 20 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Enikki maintains blinds in four trees around the lodge. 
Creatures moving through the grass have a partial concealment (20% miss 
chance) at best when viewed from a blind, and no concealment at all when
 within 50 feet of one.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The blinds have walls made from wooden slats spaced to 
let Enikki shoot out. The blind gives anyone in it total concealment 
(50% miss chance) as well as cover (+4 AC bonus), against anyone outside
 the blind. A character in the blind can be seen as a dim outline from 
outside the blind, so the character isn't exactly invisible, but the 
viewer cannot clearly see the character, hence the miss chance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's possible to hide in the blind. The character inside
 makes a normal Hide check and anyone viewing the blind makes a Spot 
check (with appropriate penalties for distance) to notice the hidden 
character. A successful Spot check reveals the hidden character's 
outline, but does not really see the character noted above.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blind Walls:</b> 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp 20; break DC 16.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures: </b>Enikki spends most of his time within 
one of the blinds, watching for game to shoot. At any given time, up to 
five servants (all 1st-level elf warriors) may be in the lodge, or it 
may have no servants at all.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Elven warriors (0-5):</b> hp 4 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 102.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics:</b> As noted earlier, Enikki spends most of 
his time in one of the tree blinds, hiding and waiting for prey. 
Unfortunately, Enikki is an overeager hunter, and he often doesn't wait 
to be sure what he's shooting at. (He has injured several servants 
already -- a fact that explains why the lodge occasionally has problems 
with help.) If Enikki has difficulty hitting, he uses his <i>arrows of true aim.</i>
 Should a foe yell or shoot back, the young half-elf breaks off the 
attack and apologizes profusely. Should a foe counterattack, Enikki 
fights back as well as he can. He prefers his bow, so he tends to shoot 
at spellcasters and foes with ranged weapons before shooting at others.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once Enikki begins firing at what he thinks is a target 
(namely, anything that disturbs the vegetation even slightly or makes a 
noise), he continues until a shout or attack warns him that he's not 
shooting at an animal. In that case, he stops immediately and attempts 
to apologize to the injured character.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Sorry!" comes a voice from one of the nearby trees. 
"I'm so sorry, really!" says a young half-elf dressed in the hunting 
garb of the nobility, emerging from behind a hunting blind. "I thought 
you were a squirrel!" The half-elf sprints forward, bow clutched in his 
left hand. "Are you hurt? You sit right down; I'll run up to the lodge 
and get some salve and bandages. Really, though, you shouldn't walk 
around these woods looking like a squirrel. You could get hurt that 
way!"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">Enikki truly intends to go back to the lodge and get 
supplies to see to the injured character, but he gets distracted along 
the way and begins shooting at some other real or imagined creature 
unless someone goes with him. If not, he forgets about the incident and 
is surprised (and pleased) to see the PCs if they track him down or 
visit the lodge.</p>

Enikki. Do come on up to the lodge where we can talk. Do you hunt too? 
Have you seen any game? Deer, elk, dragons? I do so love to hunt. I got 
an 8-point buck the other day. Want to see it? I mounted the head over 
my fireplace. And I've winged a couple of bigger creatures too. A dragon
 and an owlbear."</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Weapon of True Aim </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The true aim property can be applied to any ammunition or ranged weapon. A true aim weapon literally homes in on its target.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Description:</b> True aim weapons look much like 
their normal counterparts, though they may sport some kind of telltale 
decoration. For example, true aim ammunition often has feathers from 
giant eagles or giant owls, and a true aim bow or crossbow might feature
 a pair of eyes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Activation: </b>The true aim property is activated when you fire the weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Effect:</b> When a character firing a true aim weapon
 misses because of concealment, the weapon allows the shooter to reroll 
the percentile dice one time to determine whether the shot actually 
hits. A true aim weapon also grants an additional +1 enhancement bonus 
(over and above whatever the weapon's basic enhancement happens to be) 
on attack rolls whenever the target has cover. A target with total cover
 remains impossible to hit, however.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Aura/Caster Level:</b> Moderate divination, CL 7th.<br><b>Construction: </b>Requires Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <i>true strike</i> spell, as +1 bonus.<br><b>Weight: </b>As weapon.<br><b>Cost:</b> As +1 bonus.</p>
