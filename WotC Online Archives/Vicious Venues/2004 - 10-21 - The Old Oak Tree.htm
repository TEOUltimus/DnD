<p align="left">The massive tree has a lofty crown higher than a temple 
spire and a spread of branches broad enough to shade a whole town 
square. The mossy trunk looks big enough to swallow a peasant's hut. 
Though its sheer size suggests great age, the tree seems exceptionally 
vigorous. It has very green leaves and no visible dead wood.</p>
<p align="left">Ancient oaks aren't so rare, but this one is special. Belrioveial, a dryad, calls the tree home.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="left">Belrioveial's oak is sturdy and healthy, but it's 
hollow. Belrioveial has ample room inside to dwell in reasonable 
comfort, at least by human standards.</p>
<p align="left">Belrioveial spends her time tending her tree, carefully 
pruning its leaves and branches to promote vigor and strength. She also 
keeps watch over the countryside around the tree, tending the plants if 
necessary and protecting them from damage or destruction.</p>
<p align="left"><b>About Belrioveial</b></p>
<p align="left">Belrioveial has lived in her tree for much longer than 
she can remember, but it has been several centuries at least. Whatever 
happens to her, Belrioveial always tries to be as calm and strong as her
 tree. She doesn't get angry, but she doesn't back down either. She 
treats friendly visitors with soothing words and an abundance of charm.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">Birdsong fills the air in the glade, and the scent of 
flowers wafts on the breeze. Soon the songs of the birds seem to take on
 words -- or perhaps the words are so perfectly attuned to the sounds of
 nature that they seem a part of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mighty oak is strong and tall,<br> The birds take joy in flight,<br> The butterflies dance in the breeze,<br> Won't you stop and rest the night?</p>
<p> There is time tomorrow for battle,<br> And time beyond that for treasure,<br> But today is a gem beyond price,<br> And time with friends a gift beyond measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The singer is a lovely maid who sits in a lower bough of
 the ancient oak. Her hair is the vibrant green of summer leaves, and 
her eyes are as brown as the oak's bark. "I didn't mean to startle you,"
 she says in her soft, musical voice. "But this lovely day would be even
 more pleasant with some company. Won't you rest a while and have some 
lavender tea with me?"</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> Belrioveial prefers negotiation to 
fighting, and she can prove an impressive negotiator. She's mainly 
concerned with the safety of her tree (and thus her own safety) and the 
health and beauty of the land around it. If she cannot persuade 
interlopers to treat the land with respect, she uses her magical 
abilities to lend a little weight to her persuasion. If an encounter 
comes down to a battle, Belrioveial tends to hide in the boughs of her 
tree and snipe with her bow. She concentrates her attacks on whoever 
seems the most belligerent. If Belrioveial can eliminate that character,
 she tries to open negotiations again. If a fight goes more than a few 
rounds, she uses her <i>tree stride</i> ability to move from tree to 
tree -- a tactic that tends to keep foes guessing about where 
Belrioveial actually is and also discourages them from attacking her 
tree.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="left">Dryads usually dwell deep in sylvan lands, where one 
finds nothing but trees and woodland creatures for miles and miles. 
Belrioveial is an unusual dryad, however, and her tree might be found 
anywhere. Perhaps she dwells in the last remaining stand of ancient 
forest in an area that has long been cleared for farmland. Her winning 
ways (and powers of enchantment) might have convinced settlers moving 
into the area to spare at least a few trees. Belrioveial might even be 
found dwelling in a city, where her tree and the surrounding woods form a
 park or an enclave where elves or gnomes dwell. In any case, one of 
following rumors or events might draw the PCs to Belrioveial's tree:</p>
<ul>
<li> Belrioveial has grown lonely and taken a lover. Her companion might
 have entered the relationship willingly, or the dryad might have 
ensnared the character with her <i>charm </i>power (as legend says dryads are wont to do).<br><br>
 The PCs might know the missing character or might be hired to locate 
and recover the character. Belrioveial is willing to release her 
companion, but only after a year and a day. The dryad might be convinced
 to surrender the companion earlier if the PCs do her some service, such
 as undertaking a task she cannot complete herself (she must remain near
 her tree), or perhaps finding her another companion.<br><br></li>
<li>Tales of a powerful enchantress who dwells in an invisible castle 
deep in the forest begin to circulate. The stories say the enchantress 
has unearthly beauty and impeccable manners, but that is merely a 
disguise; she really is a loathsome fiend that entraps mortals and 
feasts on their flesh and their souls.<br><br> These tales might refer 
to a real demon or devil that has taken up residence near Belrioveial's 
tree. Or, the tales could be exaggerated stories based on Belrioveial 
herself. In this case, they might simply be wild rumors spun out of fear
 and ignorance, or perhaps a carefully planned deception aimed at 
removing Belrioveial from her forest. Greedy woodcutters or land 
speculators might lie behind the deception, or perhaps an evil forest 
creature, such as a green dragon, is behind it all. In any case, 
Belrioveial probably can set the story straight if the PCs give her a 
chance.<br><br></li>
<li>A group of forest denizens has put out a call for adventurers to 
help them with a problem. Perhaps they must deal with a monster they 
can't handle on their own. Perhaps they're involved in a dispute and 
require a disinterested third party to provide an escort or security for
 a diplomatic mission. Or perhaps a lost city has been rediscovered and 
the being dwelling near it merely wishes to have a say in who gets the 
privilege of exploring it.<br><br> The forest residents have chosen 
Belrioveial to represent their interests and to handle all negations 
with strangers. If the PCs wish to take advantage of the opportunity the
 forest dwellers present, they must deal with Belrioveial, who can 
explain the terms and conditions of the deal and give them what 
information is available.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Visiting the Tree</b></p>
<p align="left">Belrioveial's tree stands within a broad ring of younger
 oaks that have grown up from acorns the tree has dropped over the 
years.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left">The thick canopy of greenery overhead suddenly gives way
 to a loftier space, also roofed in living foliage. Here, a single tree 
rises above the surrounding forest. The effect resembles a dome rising 
above a wider hall; the gap between the tops of the lesser trees and the
 elder tree's branches creates a ring of fiery sunlight on the ground 
below, and beds of vibrant wildflowers thrive in the light. Elsewhere, a
 riot of ferns grows in the dim light.</p>
<p align="left">The central tree has a bole as tall and wide as a castle
 tower and a spread of branches thick and wide enough to hold a small 
keep. The tree's thick bark, mossy trunk, and vast size would seem to 
suggest great age, though the whole tree seems as fresh and green as a 
sapling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">When her botanical chores don't demand Belrioveial's 
attention (see the About Belrioveial section), she usually relaxes in 
the tree's branches. She enters the tree's hollow trunk only to sleep or
 in inclement weather (though light rain or snow doesn't bother her 
much). An opening at the top of the trunk allows her access to the 
interior via a rope ladder. The opening isn't visible from the ground. 
Overhanging branches keep this entrance dry.</p>
<p align="left">Inside the tree, Belrioveial has an upper chamber that 
serves her as a sitting room, kitchen, and pantry. Below that lies 
another floor with Belrioveial's bedchamber, and other rooms for storage
 and for guests. Belrioveial has a few pieces of furniture, which are 
made from green branches bent into shape and padded with moss and ferns 
where necessary.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Creatures (EL 4-13): </b>In addition to Belrioveial, 
several of the dryad's neighbors often loiter near the tree. Some are 
neighbors dropping by to pass the time with the dryad, and others drop 
by to help keep her safe or to assist with her labors. Characters can 
meet Belrioveial alone or in the company with any of the following:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Satyrs (3-5):</b> hp 22 each, see <i>Monster Manual</i>
 page 219. One of the satyrs has a set of pipes. These creatures come to
 flatter Belrioveial and flirt with her. She sometimes joins them in 
singing and dancing, but she usually keeps her distance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Pixies (6-11):</b> hp 3 each, see <i>Monster Manual</i> page 236. One of the pixies has the <i>Otto's</i><i>irresistible dance</i>
 ability. The pixies come to play harmless pranks on Belrioveial (and on
 any visiting satyrs). The pixies sometimes drive Belrioveial a little 
wild. Nevertheless, she is fond of the pixies and they absolutely adore 
her.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dire Boars (1-2 or 5-8):</b> hp 52 each, see <i>Monster Manual</i>
 page 63. These creatures come to gobble up the acorns that fall from 
Belrioveial's tree. Belrioveial has used her wild empathy ability to 
make them somewhat friendly and docile, at least toward her.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Tactics:</b> While near Belrioveial's tree, none of 
these creatures will attack unless Belrioveial does or unless they 
perceive some threat to the dryad or her tree. In a fight, these 
creatures act according to their natures but also take their cues from 
Belrioveial. The satyrs or pixies don't use deadly force unless 
Belrioveial does. Once roused, however, they defend the dryad as though 
they were defending their own homes. The dire boars aren't so subtle. 
When they attack, they usually close with the closest enemy and fight 
until dead. Belrioveial adjusts her tactics to account for her allies. 
For example, when firing arrows she tries not to hit an ally, and she 
may use her enchantment abilities to break up attacks against them. If

<p align="left"><b>Skip Williams</b> keeps busy with freelance projects for several different game companies and was the Sage of <i><b>Dragon</b> Magazine</i> for 18 years. Skip is a co-designer of the <b>D&amp;D</b> 3rd Edition game and the chief architect of the <i>Monster Manual</i>.
 When not devising swift and cruel deaths for player characters, Skip 
putters in his kitchen or garden (rabbits and deer are not Skip's 
friends) or works on repairing and improving the century-old farmhouse 
that he shares with his wife, Penny, and a growing menagerie of pets.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Penny Williams</b> joined the roleplaying game industry as Game Questions Expert for TSR, Inc. in the 1980s. Since then, she has served as <b>RPGA</b> Network Coordinator, <i><b>Polyhedron</b></i><i>Newszine</i>
 editor, and Senior Editor and Coordinating Editor for the RPG R&amp;D 
Department at Wizards of the Coast, Inc. Now a busy freelancer, Penny 
edits for several game companies and runs the online playtesting program
 for Wizards products. When not enhancing the cruelty of the deaths PCs 
will suffer at the hands of designers, Penny puts up jam, works jigsaw 
puzzles, and tutors students in math and science.</p>
