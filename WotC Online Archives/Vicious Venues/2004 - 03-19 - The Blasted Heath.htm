<p align="LEFT">In a barren wasteland where the cold wind blows over 
rolling ground, unhindered by wall, tree, or hill, nothing but sickly 
grass grows in the sandy soil. One hears little here, except the moaning
 wind and the plaintive calls of unseen birds. Surely bold adventurers 
have nothing to fear in this empty place -- or do they?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The heath is best located near a settled area, but make 
it some distance from any large towns or cities. The area might be 
barren from a combination of harsh winds and poor soil. Or, perhaps, the
 heath was once verdant farmland laid waste in the dim past by a 
rampaging dragon or other fearsome monster. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Today, no one lives on the heath save for a covey of 
hags who pose as three wise women. They claim to find lost items, mix 
love potions, tell fortunes, and provide other magical services for 
those determined enough to make the journey to their decrepit cottage. 
The hags can provide many of these services legitimately, thanks to 
their covey abilities. Mostly, however, these businesses simply provide a
 smokescreen that allows the hags to keep tabs on the communities that 
border the heath and serves as a lure that brings them a steady supply 
of victims. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Rumor has it that evil fey (or evil undead, depending on
 who is telling the tale) hunt on the heath, ensnaring any mortals they 
find. The hags started these rumors to account for the steady 
disappearances among their customers. Local superstitions and gossip (as
 well as numerous victims) keep them going. The hags don't always wait 
for their victims to come to them. Occasionally, they stage a nocturnal 
raid on a village themselves.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Recently, a swanmay named Icara came to the heath to try
 and locate the source of the disappearances. Icara is unusual even for a
 swanmay, and her presence hasn't ended the unease the locals feel about
 the heath.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Hags</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The hag covey consists of three greenhags. They dwell in
 a sod hut built into a low hill near the center of the heath. The hags 
use their <i>disguise self </i>abilities to appear as three half-elf 
sisters: one old, one middle-aged, and one fairly young. They tend 
gardens of vegetables, flowers, and herbs. They also keep a goat and a 
few ducks and geese. To the casual viewer, they seem perfectly harmless.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Greenhags (3):</b> hp 49 each; see <i>Monster Manual</i>, page 143.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Icara the Swanmay</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Icara usually can't be seen at all, thanks to her 
greater invisibility ability. Creatures that actually catch a glimpse of
 her (with a divination spell or on occasions when she chooses to become
 visible) see a petite humanoid female about 3 feet tall. She has a 
svelte, muscular figure and bronze skin. She has little hair, but sports
 a natural mohawk of wiry, flame-red hair and slender, coppery spines. 
Slits in her studded leather armor accommodate her gossamer wings, which
 have an amber tint and red-gold veins. Her large eyes are yellow, with 
green irises and vertical pupils, like a cat's. Icara is an inveterate 
do-gooder, but her appearance doesn't inspire confidence, especially not
 in ignorant folk.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As one might guess from her description, Icara comes from differing parents; she's a half pixie, half copper dragon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Raised by the pixies, Icara was fortunate enough to see 
her dragon father reasonably often, since he lived nearby. His presence 
and longtime association with the pixie colony kept her from feeling 
like an outsider, and the young half-dragon grew up with a sunny 
personality and a love of pranks and practical jokes unrivaled in her 
community.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When she grew to maturity, her unusual strength made her
 the ideal candidate for protecting her community against threats of all
 kinds. Already better with the sword than any of her companions, she 
took up the ranger's path and honed her already exceptional skills at 
archery to a level unmatched in the area. But Icara yearned for 
something more, and once she was reasonably certain that no foes dwelt 
within a two-day flight of the colony, Icara set out to explore the 
world on her own terms, fight evil wherever it was hidden, and have a 
few laughs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Icara heard the rumors about the blasted heath and 
decided to check them out herself. She has her suspicions about the 
three weird sisters who live on the heath, but she hasn't yet caught 
them doing anything wrong.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Once per day, Icara can 
breathe a 60-foot line of acid. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 
points of acid damage (Reflex DC 11 half).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 1/day -- <i>dancing lights, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts</i> (DC 16), <i>dispel magic, entangle</i> (DC 15), <i>lesser confusion</i> (DC 15), <i>Otto's irresistible dance</i> (DC 22), <i>permanent image</i> (DC 20, visual and auditory elements only), <i>polymorph</i> (self only).

<p align="LEFT"><b>Special Arrows (Ex):</b> Icara employs arrows that deal no damage but have special effects. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Memory Loss:</i> An opponent struck by this arrow 
must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or lose all memory. The save DC is 
Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. The subject retains 
skills, languages, and class abilities but forgets everything else until
 it receives a <i>heal</i> spell or memory restoration with <i>limited wish, wish, </i>or <i>miracle.</i></p>

 to the druid's wild shape ability, except that she is limited to the

<p align="LEFT"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> By making a successful wild 
empathy check, Icara can improve the attitude of an animal as if making a
 Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ability 
normally takes 1 minute to use, and Icara and the animal have to be able
 to study each other (within 30 feet under normal visibility 
conditions).</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Link (Ex):</b> Icara can handle Raindrop as a free 
action, or push her as a move action. She gains a +4 bonus on all wild 
empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding Raindrop. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Share Spells (Ex): </b>Spells cast by Icara can also 
affect Raindrop if the latter is within 5 feet for the whole duration of
 the spell. Additionally, Icara may cast a spell with a target of "You" 
on Raindrop (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. Icara and 
Raindrop may share spells even if the spells normally do not affect 
animals.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs aren't likely to simply stumble onto the heath, though they might be drawn there for any number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The party discovers a map purporting to show the location of 
something of interest to the group, such as a cache of treasure (perhaps
 from a group of bandits or a dragon slain long ago), a magical gate or <i>portal,</i>
 a stand of rare herbs or other valuable plants, the entrance to a 
dungeon or mausoleum, or a lost ruin. The map might be genuine, or the 
hags might have planted it.<br><br></li>
<li>Someone living in one of the villages near the heath has finally had
 enough of all the strange disappearances in the area and puts out a 
call for help, which somehow reaches the PCs' ears.<br><br></li>
<li>Something or someone the PCs expect to receive or to meet vanishes 
near the heath. Perhaps the PCs have purchased something rare or 
valuable, and the courier who carries it is lost (along with the item).<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs are hot on the trail of some NPC who has annoyed them in 
some way (or perhaps the character is an outlaw the PCs have been hired 
to capture), and the fugitive tries to hide somewhere on the heath.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">In any case, once the PCs start asking around, they'll 
hear plenty of rumors and tales about the heath. All of them resemble 
one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The blasted heath owes its lifeless condition to the presence of a 
gateway to the unseelie realm, where all manner of evil fey dwell. The 
unnatural energies of the unseelie realm sap the life from the land. 
Even worse, the evil fey stage wild hunts over the heath. These last 
from dusk to dawn -- not every night, but often enough to make the heath
 a deadly place after dusk. Small bands of unseelie hunters stalk the 
heath even during daylight.<br><br></li>
<li>Three weird sisters, all wise in the arcane arts, dwell on the 
heath. Their magical art wards them from the effects of the unseelie 
fey. To souls brave enough to cross the heath the sisters offer 
divinations, prognostications, relief from magical afflictions, and 
other services.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Exploring the Heath</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The heath is just an empty piece of open land, and the PCs won't find much there except for the hags.</p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="#999999" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="550"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="LEFT">This rolling expanse of empty land looks as dull and 
brown as last season's fields, though the spindly grass here never seems
 to have been cut, and the mostly barren, sandy soil shows no signs of 
tillage. The wind blows cold and oddly dry. The breeze sends ripples 
through the grass. Here and there, the wind-tossed stems beat against a 
sun-bleached boulder. There isn't a soul in sight.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs try to explore the place, they eventually either find the hags' hut or meet Icara, or both.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Meeting Icara (EL 7)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Icara has surreptitiously visited the hags at their hut,
 but she has not discovered their true natures. The hags religiously 
employ their <i>disguise self </i>and <i>mind blank</i> powers to avoid discovery by unexpected visitors. The hags, however, failed to notice the invisible half-dragon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Icara spends many hours each day searching the heath for
 signs of unseelie fey (she has heard the same rumors the PCs have), so 
she's bound to locate the PCs instead. She regards any group of armed 
characters she meets as potential troublemakers and evildoers. To test 
their mettle, she devises a prank. Using her <i>polymorph</i> ability, 
she becomes a metallic dragon of Small or Medium size. She's most at 
ease as a copper dragon, but she might masquerade as a silver or gold, 
or even as a brass dragon. She then lands somewhere out of the PCs' line
 of sight (perhaps behind a boulder or in a gully) and becomes visible. 
Holding her wings clamped tightly to her back, she stumbles into view, 
utters a sigh, and collapses at their feet. In the meantime, Raindrop 
soars overhead, keeping an eye on the situation. Icara figures she can 
learn a great deal about how the PCs act by observing how they treat a 
creature in need.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Please help me," says Icara looking mournfully up at 
the PCs. "They . . . they got me. The hunters! I tried to get away, but 
they broke my wing. Well, actually I was hiding to watch them, and they 
saw me. There's a pit over by the three stinking bushes, and I covered 
it up with some old grass, and I was waiting to see if they'd fall in. 
But they didn't . . . they came for me instead. </p>
<p align="LEFT">"But will you help me? I'll give you my whole hoard if 
you do. Well, actually I don't have much of a hoard yet. Unless you 
count a crate of gingersnaps and a few rocks. They're pretty rocks, 
though. I'm just starting to get a hoard. Mom has one, though, and I'm 
sure she'd give you some if you helped me. If you didn't mind going a 
few hundred miles east for it. She sortta kicked me out, 'cause I dunked
 my brother in the tar pits to make him look like a black dragon. She 
said it was time for me to be out on my own. But she'd reward you, I'm 
sure. Unless she found out about the hole in . . . well, never mind. 
Anyway, I guess I don't have much right now. So will you help me? I'm 
really in bad shape. I think I'm gonna faint."</p>
<p align="LEFT">With that, the dragon promptly closes her eyes and 
allows her head to loll. If the PCs offer her healing without asking for
 a reward, Icara decides they are good at heart and assumes her true 
form, apologizing for the deception and asking them to help her find the
 unseelie fey. If they offer a deal for healing, she accepts and sends 
them to a stunted bush on the other side of the heath to collect their 
reward (which isn't there). If they attack her, she resumes her true 
form and lets them have it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Meeting the Hags</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The PCs might meet the hags by coming upon their 
cottage, or they might meet them on the heath while they're out hunting 
for victims or heading off to a raid.</p>
<p align="LEFT">At the cottage, the hags pretend to be going about their
 business, tending their gardens and animals. Out on the heath, they 
pretend to be gathering wild herbs. They all appear to be peasant women 
in plain dresses, carrying big woven baskets. At your option, they also 
might have some ogres or giants along to serve as muscle. In that case, 
the hags use their <i>veil</i> ability to make their companions look 
like half-elf children (visiting cousins, they explain). The hags might 
have an escort of four ogres, four hill giants, or four of each.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the PCs approach, the hags greet them more or less as follows.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Well, well, look Bertha! Visitors!" says a kindly looking old lady in a plain green dress.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Ignore them, Maybelle," says a woman with a pinched 
face and a hawkish nose, wearing a gray dress. "They probably want to 
rob us blind. Or else they're collecting for some charity."</p>
<p align="LEFT">"I'm afraid Bertha's right," says the third lady, a 
rotund woman wearing a brown dress with a white apron. "No one nice ever
 comes out here. They might even be those bad fairies we've heard talk 
of. You know they can look like anything they want."</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Clara, they're no more fairies than I am. They're just 
travelers, and we should offer them our hospitality," says the first, 
wearing an aggrieved expression. "Do come to the house with us," she 
motions with a smile.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Watch the oregano! You're bending the stalks!" says 
Bertha, waving a trowel. "Oh, these city folk are worse than rampaging 
bulls!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Are you bad fairies?" says Clara, squinting as though 
to see better. "They were here just last week -- flattened our tomato 
plants they did!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Mind the rutabagas now," says Bertha. "That's our 
winter crop! The young half-elves who came through collecting for the 
Church of the Light trampled our turnips!"</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures (EL 9, 10, 12, or 13): </b>The hags usually
 don't keep any servants at their cottage. When raiding, however, they 
might have four ogres, four hill giants, or both along for muscle.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Ogres (4):</b> hp 29 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 199.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hill Giants (4): </b>hp 102 each, see <i>Monster Manual,</i> page 123.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics: </b>When a fight begins, the hags use their 
weakness attacks against armored foes and make claw attacks against 
unarmored foes. After a few rounds, when the hags have an idea who the 
most dangerous foes are, the hags use their <i>forcecage</i> power on 
the most capable fighting types, then try to finish off the rest of the 
party. If necessary, they use their invisibility powers to thwart the 
PCs' attacks long enough to get into position to use or <i>forcecage</i>
