<p>A towering fortification clings to a remote mountainside like lichen 
on a rock. The fertile valley below contains a few ruined buildings and 
abandoned fields. Still, crops grow on terraces below the fortification.
 What has prompted the residents to spurn fertile bottomland for the 
harder task of farming the mountainside?</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p>The monastery's sensei, Qonnak, first came to the Material Plane 
several years ago as part of a rrakkma (a hunting party dedicated to 
locating and destroying mind flayers) that suffered a calamitous defeat 
in a battle deep underground. Qonnak, the sole survivor, escaped only 
through judicious use of his Tumble skill and a great deal of luck. 
Unable to return to his home monastery in Limbo, Qonnak wandered for 
several weeks, dodging mind flayers and living by his wits. He 
eventually made his way to the surface and fell in with a group of human
 settlers eking out a living in a remote mountain valley.</p>
<p>Qonnak had no love for the humans, but he realized he'd have a much 
better chance for survival with a community around him. Qonnak helped 
the settlers deal with the occasional marauding beast (including one red
 dragon) and taught a few of them the rudiments of self-defense. In 
return, the settlers taught Qonnak Common. They also built him a hut and
 provided him with food and fuel. After a few years, the settlers 
decided to move on in search of a more hospitable environment, but 
Qonnak stayed behind. By that time, he had collected a group of students
 and assorted servants. The group located a cave high above the valley 
floor and fortified the entrance. Qonnak began drilling his students in 
martial arts and the monastic life favored by the githzerai. Those 
former settlers who weren't suited to Qonnak's teaching became servants 
to the monks, growing food, making clothing, and maintaining the 
building. So far, the arrangement is working well. The monastery is 
self-sustaining and Qonnak's students have become a formidable military 
force. To his students and servants, Qonnak is simply "Sensei", and he 
has ceased to use his former name while on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>Qonnak has continued to hone his own powers during his time on the 
Material Plane and has reestablished contact with his home monastery 
(thanks to his<i> plane shift</i> ability). Qonnak's superiors are none 
too pleased about his freelance operations on the Material Plane, but 
they've decided to allow him to continue. After all, Qonnak's students, 
though merely human, could prove useful in future conflicts with the 
mind flayers or the githyanki. Qonnak has no real fondness for his 
students or servants, but he thinks of the monastery as a useful 
diversion.</p>
<p>These days, Qonnak spends most of his time training his students. He 
leaves the day-to-day operation of the community to his assistant 
Brother Moss (see below), and he occasionally questions a merchant or 
traveler about what's happening in the wider world. Qonnak hopes these 
sessions might give him a clue about mind flayer or githyanki activity 
in the area.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p>The monastery is located in a fertile, but isolated valley surrounded
 by high mountains. No roads or trade routes go anywhere near the place.
 It's unlikely that the PCs will find it unless someone sends them there
 or some other errand draws them there. Of course, if the PCs get lost 
in the mountains, they might stumble on it. Here are a few things that 
might draw the PCs to the monastery:</p>
<ul>
<li> One of the original settlers' relatives hires the PCs to carry a package or letter to the settler.<br><br>
 Perhaps the missive merely contains news about the family, or perhaps 
the PCs are entrusted with a valuable inheritance. The PCs can find the 
remains of the settlers' village, but little else. It's possible that 
the missing person has become a monk or other member of the monastic 
community, but it's more likely that he or she moved on with the other 
settlers. The monks aren't sure where the settlers went, but they can 
give the party a pretty good guess where they were headed when they 
left.<br><br></li>
<li>A new group of settlers bound for the valley hires the PCs to act as bodyguards.<br><br>
 Thanks to the monastery's presence, the area is now fairly safe for 
noncombatants. "Sensei" is willing to allow newcomers to colonize the 
area if they agree to stay off the monastery's grounds and fields. He 
also demands a nominal tribute in the form of goods or services from the
 settlers. The settlers might be glad for the monastery's protection and
 support, or they might resist. In the latter case, Qonnak and his monks
 do their best to drive them away.<br><br></li>
<li>A tribe of giants has moved out of the mountains and begun 
conducting a series of raids on the settled lands below. Citizens or 
rulers from the area look to the PCs for help.<br><br> Qonnak and his 
monks drove away the giants from their lair near the monastery some time
 ago. The giants moved somewhere else after their defeat, and they are 
trying to get established in their new location. If the PCs deal with 
the giants, they find only a temporary camp crammed with bundles of 
goods salvaged from the giants' old lair. The PCs can get the full story
 if they interrogate a captured giant, or perhaps Qonnak sends a scout 
to keep an eye on the giants. The scout can give a brief description of 
his monastery.<br><br></li>
<li>The PCs hear tales of a mysterious order of fighting monks who rule over a mountain valley that they guard jealously.<br><br>
 The tales might include additional claims, such as a great treasure or 
ancient artifact hidden in the monastery, and such details might even 
prove true. Qonnak and his students might have collected a great deal of
 loot from their victories over the years (a level 11 to 13 treasure of 
up to triple value). Qonnak might be willing to trade some of his loot 
for items he needs, such as magical weaponry or protective devices for 
his assistants or advanced students.</li>
</ul>
<p class="size3"><b>Visiting the Monastery (El 7-13)</b></p>
<p>Qonnak doesn't encourage visitors, but he doesn't waste effort trying
 to exclude travelers from the valley, either. Lost or wounded visitors 
receive what they need to get them back on their feet and a gentle 
invitation to leave as quickly as they can (lest they disturb the monks'
 tranquility). Travelers who find the valley most likely meet Brother 
Moss, Qonnak's second in command. The following text assumes the PCs 
approach the monastery on foot.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p>The winding mountain trail makes a sudden plunge into a deep, green 
valley flooded with sunlight. Tall alpine grasses and young trees carpet
 the valley floor. Here and there, parts of ruined stone walls and 
gutted cottages peek out from beneath the foliage. Open fields around 
the ruins might have been tilled once, but they're nothing but weeds 
now.</p>
<p>One of the valley's flanks sports a series of narrow terraces where 
crops grow. A winding path connects the terraces. A gatehouse blocks the
 foot of the path, and above the terraces the path ends at a tall 
fortification of some sort. A group of intact cottages stands outside 
the gatehouse. Grazing animals and field workers are visible on several 
of the terraces.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The ruined cottages mark the original settlement (see the Background 
section). The newer cottages house the monastery's servants. The monks 
have built the terraces on the valley wall to ensure steady supplies 
even if they are besieged. The only ready access to the terraces is the 
path, which climbs some 1,200 feet from the valley floor to the 
monastery gate. One must literally scale a mountain to reach a terrace 
or the monastery otherwise. Qonnak prefers the security this approach 
offers even though the valley floor is arable.</p>
<p>The fortification hides the caverns that house the monastery proper. 
It's about 70 feet high, with eight floors and a battlement on top. The 
trail ends at a portcullis in the base of the outer wall. Flights of 
stairs (all as steep as ladders) climb all the way to the battlement. 
The entrance to the caverns is located on the third floor from the 
bottom.</p>
<p>The outer fortification holds guardposts, rooms for meditation and 
training, and a barracks for the junior monks. The caverns hold 
kitchens, halls for meals and meetings, storage areas, an armory, a 
treasury, and quarters for Qonnak and the senior monks.</p>
<p>Brother Moss, a lively young human with a passion for martial arts 
and an aversion to hard labor, is the monastery's prior. He is in charge
 of overseeing the servants and workers, as well as instructing the 
junior monks. Brother Moss has a talent for turning up wherever 
something even vaguely exciting is happening -- a quirk that serves him 
well in his job. Thus, when PCs approach the cottages, the terraces, or 
the monastery itself, it's a good bet that he will be on hand to greet 
them -- most likely seated on a large rock overlooking the gatehouse and
 the lower portion of the path, where he can oversee the workers tending
 the gardens. A handful of junior monks (usually 1-4) follow in his 
wake, and he may switch between teaching one of them a new martial arts 
move and chatting with a worker or two. Read or paraphrase the following
 when the PCs come within sight of him.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p>On a large, flat rock jutting out from the mountainside just above 
and to the side of the gatehouse stand three humans. All are dressed in 
loose-fitting tunics and trousers tied with sturdy belts, but the 
clothing of one is green with white trim, and that of the other two is 
plain, peasant brown. The green-clad man says a few words to the other 
two, then seemingly without warning, he leaps into the air and executes a
 twisting kick, grabbing one of the other young men with his legs on the
 way down and toppling him to the ground. "Now you try it," he calls to 
the other, releasing his opponent and helping him up. The other young 
man makes an attempt at the maneuver, but both he and his intended 
victim end up sprawled on the rock in an ungainly heap.</p>
<p>"No, no!" cries the green-clad man, rushing over to help them up. 
"You have to start the twist on your way up, not your way down." He 
pauses while brushing some dirt from one of the men to address a young 
peasant woman who has just emerged from one of the cottages. "Elizabeth!
 Do you have any more of that blue dye made? Sensei needs a new cloak." 
The young woman nods and returns to her cottage.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>When Brother Moss notices the PCs, he calls out a cheerful greeting to them.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p>"Good morning, travelers!" the green-clad man calls out. "Welcome to 
the valley. What news do you bring of the outside world? Do come up and 
visit a while."</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Continue with the following if the PCs accept Brother Moss's invitation to join him atop the rock.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p>"Go back and practice for a while and I will join you soon," the 
young teacher says to the two men in brown. They bow and withdraw to one
 of the terraces, where they continue sparring. "It's good to meet new 
friends now and again," he says with a grin. "Oh, is that your weapon? 
It looks very finely balanced. Where did you get it? May I try it? I 
just love trying new things, don't you? You never know when you might 
find something that would fit in well with your personal regimen. It's 
important to approach life in an orderly manner, but one must constantly
 evaluate options.</p>
<p>"You know, you should try wearing green -- the color of nature. It 
would suit your complexion, I think. Have you all been adventuring? Have
 you slain any dragons or rescued any young royals in distress? Or 
perhaps pitted your strength against the foul hazards of the Underdark? 
Perhaps you have a bard who can sing of your travels? Maintaining a good
 record of one's deeds is very important, you know, and music is the 
ultimate form of expression -- rigorous in form but rapturous in 
content. Don't you agree?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Brother Moss is unfailingly cheerful regardless of the PCs' responses
 to his seemingly endless chatter, and he happily talks with them at 
length about nothing in particular. If a PC allows him to handle a 
weapon, he twirls it experimentally, testing its balance, takes a few 
practice thrusts, exclaims over the workmanship, and hands it back with 
thanks.</p>
<p>If asked, Brother Moss can tell the PCs that the monastery doesn't 
really have a name -- to him it's just home. The monks here value mental
 discipline and physical austerity. They desire peace with their 
neighbors but have been forced to fight many times against invaders from
 the surrounding mountains. The PCs are welcome to stay in a cottage 
down in the valley for a day or two if they feel the need, but should 
move on as soon as they find it convenient to do so.</p>
<p>If he takes a liking to a visitor, Brother Moss might offer that 
person an audience with Sensei, who (Brother Moss claims) occasionally 
supplements his regimen of mental exercises with a lively conversation 
with a more worldly soul.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>Creatures</b></p>
<p>The community here includes about twenty 1st-level human commoners 
and their families, who serve the monastery. The monastery proper houses
 Qonnak, the prior (Brother Moss), three instructors (4th-level human 
monks) and between twelve and eighteen 1st- and 2nd-level junior monks, 
all human. Use the NPC statistics in Chapter 4 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for the assistants and the junior monks.</p>

<p>Brother Moss is an energetic and gregarious soul -- very much the 
opposite of his calm and taciturn sensei. Despite his capacity for 
self-discipline and basically active nature, Brother Moss doesn't care 
for hard work. Sensei gave him his name early in his training because of
 his propensity for sitting on the mountainside and just enjoying nature
 (literally sitting like moss on a rock). Still, the young man had a 
passion for martial arts and focused his efforts long enough to earn a 
place in the monastery. Sensei quickly realized that Brother Moss's 
outgoing personality was better suited for managing the monastery's 
workaday affairs than his own. As the monastery's prior, Brother Moss 
oversees the servants and gives basic instruction to the junior monks. 
Sensei and his three instructors handle advanced training and matters of
 defense and strategy. When Sensei leaves to consult with his superiors 
in Limbo, Brother Moss takes charge of the whole monastery. Brother Moss
 and the junior monks remain unaware or Sensei's planar jaunts, but the 
instructors know the truth. Brother Moss and the junior monks believe 
that Sensei merely retreats to his chamber to meditate when he visits 
Limbo.</p>
<p><b>Tactics: </b>In a fight, Brother Moss uses his sai to disarm the 
most aggressive foe while his juniors hang back to guard his flanks. The
 weapon gives him a +4 bonus on the opposed roll to resolve the disarm 
attempt. Thanks to his Improved Disarm feat, the attempt does not 
provoke an attack of opportunity. If Brother Moss disarms a foe, one of 
the junior monks pounces on the fallen weapon, kicking it out of the 
foe's reach. If they can get it out of reach, the junior monks then 
collect fallen weapons and use their superior speed to carry them off. 
Once he has disarmed foes who threaten physical attacks, Brother Moss 
uses his Tumble skill or potion of <i>invisibility</i> to maneuver for 
attacks against spellcasters. He uses his light crossbow against flying

<p>Sensei rarely leaves the monastery and avoids contact with visitors 
unless he decides to grant one of his rare audiences. He prefers to meet
 only one stranger at a time. Most adventuring groups balk at those 
terms, however, and Sensei will agree to see a whole group, provided 
their weapons are peace bound (tied in their scabbards) and all spell 
component pouches are tied shut. When meeting a group. Sensei always has
 Brother Moss and two instructors in attendance.</p>
<p>Whenever he goes outside or meets a stranger, Sensei remains 
enveloped in a bulky robe that hides his frame and features. When 
dressed that way, he looks like a tall elf or a thin human -- it isn't 
immediately obvious that he's a githzerai. When conversing with a 
stranger, Sensei usually sticks to current events and the visitor's 
recent experiences, though he'll occasionally discuss the benefits of 
law and order.</p>
<p><b>Tactics: </b>In a battle, Sensei prefers unarmed strikes, though 
he'll use his nunchaku if he has trouble hitting the foe. He tries to 
hurt the enemy quickly. He might make a trip attack against the 
opposition's main fighter (using his Improve Trip feat) or he might use 
his speed or Tumble skill to reach a foe who feels safe. His Stunning 
Fist feat (DC 20) is useful for neutralizing a foe quickly. Sensei 
prefers to use stunning attacks against spellcasters and other foes who 
have weak Fortitude saves. He prefers tripping fighter types and other 
characters with better Fortitude saves.</p>
