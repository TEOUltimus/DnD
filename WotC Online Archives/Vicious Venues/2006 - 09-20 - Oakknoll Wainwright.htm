<p align="LEFT">Wagons and wagon wheels are vital implements in most <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game worlds, even if the majority of adventurers don't have much use 
for them. Nearly everyone else, from the lowliest farmer to the richest 
merchant, has a wagon or carriage for hauling freight or just for 
getting around. Oakknoll Wainwright is, at least at first glance, simply
 a place where these important, though mundane conveyances are made and 
repaired. Some wagons -- and some wainwrights -- hold secrets worth 
knowing, however.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Naibrar Meliasae, the elf owner and chief wheel and 
wainwright at Oakknoll Wainwright, is at a stage in life that most elves
 reach sooner or later. He has an urge to see the world, meet its 
people, and perfect an art. Naibrar's path to self-actualization, 
however, has taken an unusual turn. After several years of successful 
adventures as a conjurer, Naibrar discovered he had a knack for making 
things (after he had occasion to craft or repair a few wagon wheels for 
stranded travelers). Sometime thereafter, Naibrar obtained the deed to a
 hill thickly covered with a mixed forest of oaks and other hardwoods. 
Naibrar then realized that by going into business for a short while 
(perhaps a century or so), he could both hone his creative skills and 
meet an endless parade of different people.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Today, Naibrar and a team of workers (mostly humans and 
tallfellow halflings) harvest trees from Naibrar's wooded hill and use 
the lumber to make carts and wagons of all types. Naibrar also does 
repairs and makes wheels for sale to other wagon makers. Though 
Naibrar's wheels are standardized, all his carts and wagons are custom 
work, designed and built especially for each customer.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Naibrar likes a challenge and will take on nearly any 
sort of commission for a special wagon. He has built many halfling house
 wagons and a large assortment of specialty wagons -- including many 
fitted with false bottoms and secret compartments. Naibrar suspects the 
latter were intended for smuggling, but decided to accept the task of 
making them anyway, just to see if he could do it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Naibrar does most of the work himself, except for 
preparing raw lumber and any really heavy work. As a consequence, he 
works around the clock. Before dawn each day he's busy at his forge, 
making iron or steel wheel rims and other fittings for whatever projects
 he currently has in progress. Throughout the morning he works at 
cutting and shaping wooden parts. He takes a break around noon for a 
light meal and spends a few hours handling paperwork, billing, orders 
for supplies, and other sit-down tasks. In the afternoons, he test-fits 
what he has created that morning and spends the remainder of the 
afternoon and evening assembling his wares. Each evening, he spends a 
few hours in trance before arising to plan the next day's activities and
 start the whole cycle again. Naibrar's assistants find his boundless 
energy a source of wonder and amusement.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though he fills his days with work, Naibrar doesn't keep
 a rigid schedule. He occasionally declares a personal holiday, which he
 usually spends roaming the countryside and enjoying nature. He 
sometimes takes longer trips to visit friends or family (he has a son 
living with older relatives about two days' ride away).</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even on workdays, Naibrar adjusts his schedule to best 
serve his goals for the day. For example, on days when his assistants 
cut and stack lumber, Naibrar usually drops his other tasks to supervise
 the operation. No matter what he's doing at the time, Naibrar always 
takes at least a few minutes to talk with any customers who drop in.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted earlier, Naibrar's business is located at the 
foot of the wooded hill he owns. The site is located on a fairly 
well-traveled road on the outskirts of a small town or village in a 
heavily forested area. It's possible, however, that Oakknoll Wainwright 
is located in a more urban area. In that case, Naibrar's hill might be 
the only wooded land for miles around. In any case, Naibrar lives in an 
area where there is an elf colony or where elves make up a substantial 
percentage of the population.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters might pass by Oakknoll Wainwright 
several times without noticing the place. They might stop there to 
purchase a vehicle, to have a vehicle repaired, or perhaps to sell one. 
It's also possible that something else will draw a group to the place:</p>
<ul>
<li>As Naibrar suspects, some of his special wagons have been used for 
smuggling. The authorities have seized several of these wagons, and they
 believe that Naibrar is a smuggler himself. The authorities hire the 
PCs to investigate Naibrar's role in the smuggling operation. Meanwhile,
 the smugglers believe that Naibrar sold them out and vow revenge. The 
smugglers might send thugs to deal with Naibrar, giving the PCs a chance
 to identify the smuggler leadership, or the smugglers might try to 
mislead the PCs by implicating Naibrar in their plots.<br><br></li>
<li>An entire caravan of goods carried in wagons Naibrar built has gone 
missing recently and his customers blame Naibrar for the loss. Naibrar 
isn't legally bound to respond, but the charge of providing faulty goods
 has affected him deeply (the situation is bad for business as well). 
Naibrar hires the PCs to track down the lost caravan and find out what 
happened to it.<br><br> The caravan wasn't lost because of faulty wagons
 from Naibrar. Perhaps bandits or a monster attacked, or perhaps a 
dishonest guide led it astray.<br><br></li>
<li> There has been a rash of fatal accidents recently among well-heeled
 aristocrats and wealthy business people. The wheels on their expensive 
carriages have failed when moving at very high speeds. One victim's 
family hires the PCs to investigate the incident, and Naibrar provided 
at least some of the (apparently) faulty wheels.<br><br> It might simply
 be a coincidence that several similar accidents have occurred, but 
perhaps someone staged all the accidents to cover a single 
assassination. Or perhaps several different killers have decided to use a
 similar technique. The carriage wheels might simply have been sabotaged
 (with the Disable Device skill) or perhaps they were built to collapse 
deliberately. In the latter case, Naibrar might be responsible for the 
trick wheels. Perhaps he simply could not resist the challenge of making
 them. More likely, however, he recognized how dangerous trick wheels 
would be. In that case, Naibrar would have refused to make them. A rival
 (possibly a former assistant who bears Naibrar a grudge) actually made 
the trick wheels.<br><br></li>
<li> An infamous spy or outlaw has been identified and pursued through 
the area where Oakknoll Wainwright is located. The fugitive, however, 
seems to have vanished and is presumed to be hiding somewhere nearby. 
The PCs are hired to track down the fugitive.<br><br> The fugitive was 
hidden in a wagon (possibly in a secret compartment or possibly simply 
hidden in the cargo). The wagon has been brought to Naibrar ostensibly 
for a repair (or perhaps the repair is genuine). Either Naibrar or one 
of his assistants has hidden the fugitive. The visitor might be 
concealed somewhere in a complex of buildings that the business uses, or
 perhaps somewhere on the wooded slopes above. The fugitive also could 
be hidden in plain sight as one of Naibrar's assistants. The person 
hiding the fugitive might be an accomplice or a paid servant. Or perhaps
 the fugitive has a relative or longtime friend at Oakknoll Wainwright.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Oakknoll Wainwright (EL 9)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Naibrar's business occupies a small complex of buildings
 that house all phases of wagon construction, from cutting and curing 
lumber to forging metal parts to final assembly and painting.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">A well-traveled road winds past a hillside covered with 
broad-leafed trees, and a deep gully with a trickle of water running 
through its depths separates the road from the hillside. A trail 
branches from the road and crosses the gully via a stone bridge wide 
enough for one lane of traffic. The trail winds uphill perhaps a bowshot
 before entering a clearing encircled by a low stone wall.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A two-story wooden building stands at the trailhead. The
 lower floor features a tall doorway wide enough for a formal coach, and
 a weathered wagon wheel hangs over this doorway.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Visitors can walk right onto the property anytime. 
Naibrar doesn't feel the need to keep regular business hours because 
customers can find him at work just about anytime. When the PCs visit, 
he assumes they're customers. He's accustomed to adventurers, so he 
reacts with equanimity to whatever they say. Read or paraphrase the 
following when they arrive.</p>

 work. "Greetings, travelers!" he says with a smile. "If you seek a 
wheeled conveyance of any sort for your travels, I have many options to 
choose from. Or, if you need a custom vehicle, I can make one to your 
specifications. So what shall it be? A sturdy wagon to transport crops 
to market? A gilded carriage for riding to fancy soirees in style? An 
armored war chariot? Or will you challenge my creativity in some other 
way?" The corners of his mouth lift in a smile that does not quite touch
 his shrewd eyes.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Naibrar usually conducts business in the main shop (see below). The major buildings on the site include the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Main Shop:</b> This is the building described 
above. The ground floor is given over to a spacious workshop where 
Naibrar does most of his work. A floor-to-ceiling tool rack fills the 
back wall. Workbenches fill the wall on the right side. The left wall 
has a desk and staircase leading to the second floor. The center of the 
floor usually contains Naibrar's current project.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The upper floor contains Naibrar's living quarters and an archive of plans and specifications for past projects.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Stable:</b> A simple wooden building behind the main shop has stalls for three draft horses. A loft above holds grain and fodder.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Smithy:</b> A small brick building just uphill from the main shop houses a forge, metalworking tools, and a supply of charcoal.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Lumber Drying Sheds:</b> Two long, low wooden 
buildings upslope from the smithy and main shop are filled with racks 
where Naibrar stores and cures freshly cut lumber.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures: </b>Naibrar has one to three workmen to assist him most days; use the statistics for 1st-level rogues from the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide.</i>
 These employees go home before dark each day and return just after 
dawn. During the workday, one usually accompanies Naibrar, and the 
others (if present) are at work elsewhere on the property.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Naibrar also has acquired a pair of hammerers to assist 
with security and heavy labor. Unless he has the automatons working on a
 special task, Naibrar usually keeps them out of sight but fairly close 
at hand, in case he needs their help.</p>
