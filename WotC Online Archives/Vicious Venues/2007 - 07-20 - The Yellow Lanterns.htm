<p align="LEFT">Even adventurers need to eat, but most player characters
 don't maintain their own kitchens, and nobody likes to eat trail 
rations all the time. The next time your group starts feeling hunger 
pangs, consider a visit to the Yellow Lanterns, a hole-in-the-wall 
eatery that features some exotic dishes and an unexpectedly exotic staff
 as well.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Background for the DM</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A semi-retired adventurer, Xuemun, and her two 
daughters, Qiaolian and Liqiu, run the Yellow Lanterns, named for the 
array of yellow paper lanterns that Xuemun has strung along the front 
window. Such accoutrements are very popular in her homeland.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Yellow Lanterns is best described as a cafe or 
restaurant, but to the proprietors, it's merely the family business. The
 women prepare hot meals and beverages throughout the day. They also buy
 baked goods and produce daily for resale to their customers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xuemun's homeland is very far away, and the food she 
grew up with uses many fiery spices, plus noodles and unusual 
vegetables, but very little meat. To her neighbors, Xuemun's native 
dishes seem exotic -- if not downright bizarre. Xuemun is wise enough, 
however, to cook what her customers like to eat, so she mostly serves 
familiar local dishes. Still, she prepares food she likes for herself, 
her daughters, and a few of her more adventurous customers. Xuemun is 
slowly building up a clientele that favors her native mode of cooking.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xuemun wasn't always a cook. She is a tiefling who was 
born, and soon orphaned, in the slums within a vast city located on a 
long-distance trade route (her world's equivalent of Earth's Silk Road).
 When Xuemun was still just a slip of a girl, a horde of barbarians 
swept into her city on horseback and leveled the place. One rider was 
taken with Xuemun and her feral self-reliance. The horseman informally 
adopted her and raised her as his own. By the time she reached 
adolescence Xuemun was an accomplished rider and a seasoned fighter. 
Thanks to her darkvision, she proved adept at leading night raids 
against cities, towns, and merchant caravans. She often posed as a 
merchant or pilgrim herself, infiltrating a caravan or settlement and 
laying the groundwork for a raid.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Late one year, Xuemun infiltrated a caravan that became 
snowbound after an unexpected blizzard. Xuemun's raiders were lost in 
the storm and froze to death. She survived by truly joining the caravan,
 whose experienced and compassionate leader held everyone together and 
kept the whole group warm and adequately fed. When the ordeal was over, 
Xuemun came to believe that her personal success need not depend on 
another person's failure and that people who know how to work together 
are stronger than loners. She still values her personal freedom and 
harbors an acute distrust for most forms of authority, but she has vowed
 to live her life without harming anyone else if she can help it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xuemun spent several years working as a caravan guard 
and guide before taking up adventuring full time. Eventually, she met 
another tiefling who become her companion and lover. Between adventures 
the couple had two daughters. Shortly after the youngest, Liqiu, was 
born, Xuemun's beau abandoned the family. He had never quite understood 
Xuemun's philosophy of making her way without making waves, and he 
always felt that Xuemun's sense of personal responsibility was just 
plain silly.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When she found herself on her own with two daughters to 
support, Xuemun decided it was time to settle into a situation that was 
fairly safe and stable. Her time on the caravan trail taught her that 
while cooks aren't always respected, people generally don't get angry 
with the person who feeds them, especially when the food is tasty. 
Xuemun traveled far from home -- putting many leagues between her and 
any old enemies she might have overlooked.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Xuemun and her Daughters</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Xuemun looks a great deal like a wild elf. She has olive
 skin, midnight black hair, and large, almond-shaped green eyes. She 
also has thick bristles, much like a hedgehog's, running from the back 
of her head down her spine. She has a short, bristly tail above her rump
 and batlike ears covered with fine fur. By wearing a loose dress and 
keeping her hair very long, Xuemun keeps these fiendish attributes 
hidden.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xuemun's oldest daughter, Qiaolian, shares her mother's 
dark hair and skin. Instead of bristles and a short tail, she has 
leathery plates down her neck and spine, which she keeps concealed under
 her clothing. Her ears are like an elf's, but thinner and longer.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Qiaolian is just old enough to remember her father's 
departure and the long journey with the remainder of her family to their
 new home. She has thrived in the new locale. She has a natural sense of
 mischief that has gotten her in trouble with the local constables once 
or twice, but it has also won her many friends among the common folk. 
Though Qiaolian is an accomplished pickpocket and lock picker, she shies
 away from crime, though she's not above fleecing the occasional boor or
 slumming noble dandy.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When not working at the Yellow Lanterns, Qiaolian goes adventuring with a few like-minded folks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Liqiu, the youngest daughter, has skin and hair a shade 
lighter than her mother's, but she has her mother's eyes and ears. Her 
spine is smooth, but she has only four very long toes on each foot. When
 Liqiu wears shoes and covers her ears with her hair, she looks pretty 
much like a wild elf.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Liqiu doesn't remember her father or any home other than
 the Yellow Lanterns. She has a mild obsession with her fiendish 
heritage and has used her knowledge of planar matters as a springboard 
into a career as a warlock. Like her mother and sister, she goes her own
 way without harming others if she can help it. Like her sister, she 
splits her time between the Yellow Lanterns and adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>The Setup</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The Yellow Lanterns is best placed in a working-class 
neighborhood in a large, cosmopolitan city, but it could be located in 
almost any community. If located in a fairly small settlement, the 
Yellow Lanterns should be a little off the beaten track, perhaps in an 
alley or on a quiet street where craftspeople ply their trades.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Player characters might locate the Yellow Lanterns when 
looking for an inexpensive place for a meal or when trying to purchase a
 rare herb. The staff at the Yellow Lanterns does more than stand behind
 the counter, however, and their activities might leave tendrils that 
attract or ensnare player characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of daring cat burglaries has occurred in the homes of 
nobles and wealthy merchants. The burglars have shown great skill in 
climbing walls, bypassing locks, wards, traps, and guards, and fleeing 
with small amounts of highly valuable items, such as jewels, portable 
artwork, or magic items.<br><br> The authorities have pieced together 
descriptions of several of the burglars (taken from various witnesses 
who saw or claim to have seen them) and have offered a reward for their 
capture. One of the descriptions matches Qiaolian, at least as far as 
height, weight, age, gender, and apparent race.<br><br> If the PCs take 
up this challenge, their investigations eventually lead them to the 
Yellow Lanterns. The PCs might quickly surmise that the staff is hiding 
something, and they are -- Xuemun and her daughters take some pains to 
conceal their true race, and they might have other things to hide as 
well (see the other suggestions in this section).<br><br> Qiaolian might
 be innocent, or she might be connected with some or all the burglaries.
 In the latter case, Qiaolian most likely has targeted a few 
particularly loathsome people who have abused, short-changed, or 
outright swindled common folk and has taken it upon herself to give some
 of their ill-gotten gains back to the victims. Perhaps a few less 
altruistic thieves have copied her or possibly set out to frame her.<br><br></li>
<li> A rash of disappearances has plagued the area near the Yellow 
Lanterns. The victims all seem to be newcomers with no connections to 
any long-term resident in the area. This fact has given rise to fears 
that the missing people are being kidnapped for some sinister purpose.<br><br>
 If the PCs investigate, they can easily discover that several newcomers
 have briefly appeared on the streets in the district where the Yellow 
Lanterns lies, and have been seen frequenting the Yellow Lanterns before
 vanishing.<br><br> Xuemun and her daughters have become part of an 
underground railroad that helps slaves (and perhaps political prisoners)
 escape servitude. When fugitives arrive, Xuemun finds them minor jobs 
for a few days or weeks until she can move them along. The fugitives are
 supposed to be posing as itinerant workers, pilgrims, or travelers down
 on their luck. Unfortunately, not all the escapees Xuemun has helped 
are good at lying low, and her neighbors have noticed their departures 
(even if they can't recall when the newcomers first arrived). If 
confronted, Xuemun admits that she "suspected" that some of those she 
has helped were indeed escaped slaves, but that she figured that was 
none of her business. She'll admit to nothing except to help find jobs 
for a few potential customers. The slaves' owners, however, aren't 
likely to accept that and might target Xuemun -- and possibly the PCs, 
too -- if the escape ring isn't broken and the current group of escapees
 rounded up.<br><br></li>
<li> A few very rare or unusual gems have recently surfaced in the 
community where the Yellow Lanterns stands. A collector or spellcaster 
wants the PCs to track down their source.<br><br> Xuemun might be the 
source of the gems. Perhaps they were part of the spoils from an 
adventure long ago and Xuemun had to sell them to meet an unanticipated 
expense. Or perhaps Xuemun's estranged mate has reappeared, offering 
them as gifts -- which Xuemun promptly sold for ready cash. Xuemun may 
or may not have access to more gems. It's possible that Xuemun is not 
the source of the gems, but knows something about where they can be 
purchased. In any case, rivals of the PCs' employer will do all they can
 to keep the group from obtaining any gems.<br><br></li>
<li> Some precious item from Xuemun's homeland (or its environs) has 
come into vogue and is in high demand. Counterfeits abound, and black 
marketers are making a killing selling the item without paying any of 
the taxes legally due on it. The PCs are hired to break the smuggling 
ring.<br><br> Xuemun might be a suspected smuggler, or the authorities 
might direct the PCs to her as a possible expert on the item's 
manufacture, transport, and ultimate source. The item itself might be a 
simple luxury, such as silk, an important medicine, such as quinine, or 
even a dangerous drug. Xuemun has no sympathy for tax collectors, but 
she is concerned about the plight of honest merchants trying to stay on 
the correct side of the law and for common folk subjected to something 
they cannot handle. She might help or hinder the PCs in their 
investigations as her conscience dictates. In any case, the smugglers 
are no angels and use deadly force to defeat the PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Visiting the Yellow Lanterns (EL 5-9)</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The following text depicts the Yellow Lanterns on a 
typical business day. The place doesn't look much different at night, 
except that the lanterns that give the place its name flood the scene 
with amber-colored light.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The narrow, winding street has well-worn, but fairly 
clean cobbles. The cramped, stone storefronts on either side look 
similarly tired, but perhaps a little better maintained. One little 
storefront stands out. It has a wooden door painted bright red and a big
 window made of dozens of small diamond-shaped panes. A multitude of 
small paper lanterns, each as bright as a fresh daisy, hang all around 
the window like a fringe. A red awning protects the window and the 
lanterns from the worst of the elements, but even the slightest breeze 
makes the lanterns jump and dance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The thick glass in the window doesn't give a clear view 
of what's going on inside, but the place's function is clear if the PCs 
enter.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">The stone floors and walls in the room beyond the door 
give the place a slight chill. Nevertheless, the tantalizing scent of 
exotic spices and the more familiar smells of soup and stew simmering on
 a hearth welcome the visitor like a friendly hug. Many paper lanterns 
like those outside hang from the ceiling, bathing the place in a warm 
glow.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Rows of tables and chairs stand under the window and run
 back many paces to a counter with an open wall behind it. An array of 
ladles and iron pots hangs in the opening. Beyond the curtain of cooking
 implements, a wood-fired stove covered with pans of sizzling food is 
visible.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">The Yellow Lantern opens before dawn each day, ready to 
serve breakfast to the workers in the neighborhood. Xuemun and her 
daughters also serve lunch, dinner, and a late supper. They close only 
when the last customers take their leave well after dark.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If the PCs enter, Liqiu greets them as follows.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">A slim young girl with long, sleek, brown hair, 
honey-colored skin, and almond-shaped eyes approaches. "You want table?"
 she says with a smile, gesturing to an empty table nearby. "We have the
 best food here. Stew, roast meat, or you like something more special?"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If any PCs indicate an interest in "something special," 
she offers to bring them a sampling of dishes from her mother's native 
land. If the PCs agree, she disappears into the back room and returns 
with a tray containing many tiny dishes, each with a small amount of 
some exotic (and often spicy) food.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#999999" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td>
<p align="LEFT">"Li hwo boar with fried noodles, wild chicken with 
tangin sauce, and cockatrice nest soup with wild celery. And a few 
others for you to try. Enjoy!"</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">If the three tieflings have any pressing concerns and 
feel that the aid of adventurers would be beneficial, they include a 
cryptic note inside a folded cookie that they serve the party for 
dessert. The message indicates that they should come to some dark, 
mysterious location at midnight if they're interested in acquiring lots 
of treasure.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Creatures</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As noted earlier, Xuemun and her daughters run the 
Yellow Lanterns. Most days, Xuemun cooks and one of her daughters 
serves. When one or more of the family is away on business or an 
adventure, one family member cooks and an employee serves. Most of the 
employees are Qiaolian's friends and are low-level rogues (use the rogue
 statistics from Chapter 4 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). Some of them might not be averse to relieving customers of a few coins through their Sleight of Hand skills.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It is not unusual to find all three members of the family at work, especially during the Yellow Lanterns' busiest hours.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Tactics</b> : Xuemun and her daughters are always 
ready for a fight, though they'd prefer to avoid combat if possible. 
They wear their light armor under their clothing and keep their weapons 
concealed on their bodies or stashed out of sight under a counter or 
inside a pot.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Each family member has her own approach to combat, as suits her abilities.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Xuemun prefers direct combat. She singles out the most 
dangerous-looking foe and closes to melee range, hoping to send the 
survivors packing once she has defeated the opposition's champion. She 
uses her speed and her Mobility feat to take the fight to her chosen 
target. If she can't defeat that opponent quickly, she uses her <i>darkness</i> power to conceal herself, then rages. The <i>darkness</i>
 effect also gives her foes concealment, but Xuemun counts on her 
Blind-Fight feat to give her an edge. If Qiaolian is present in the 
fight, Xuemun skips the <i>darkness</i> effect and uses her <i>potion of</i><i>displacement</i> instead. If a foe seems particularly tough, she uses her <i>potion of</i><i>haste</i> before raging.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Qiaolian prefers to fight from behind cover when she 
can. The cafe's counter or an overturned table can serve nicely as some 
added protection. When fighting alone, she uses her Improved Feint feat 
to help her make sneak attacks. When she has an ally for support, she 
uses her Tumble skill to get into flanking position for sneak attacks. 
She might use her tanglefoot bag to immobilize a dangerous foe and her 
Combat Expertise feat for some extra Armor Class.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Liqiu tries to stay out of melee reach if she can. Her <i>spiderwalk</i> invocation is useful for that, since it allows her to walk up the Yellow Lantern's walls as if using the <i>spider climb</i> spell. Once in position, she uses her <i>eldritch blast,</i> sometimes altered with her <i>sickening blast</i> invocation (Fortitude save or become sickened for 1 round) to defeat foes. If successfully counterattacked, she uses her <i>darkness</i>
 power for concealment and protection against further attacks (but not 
if Qiaolian is part of the fight). If she has trouble hitting foes 
concealed in a <i>darkness</i> effect, she uses her <i>see the unseen </i>invocation (which combines the effects of a <i>see invisibility</i> spell with the power to see though darkness).</p>
