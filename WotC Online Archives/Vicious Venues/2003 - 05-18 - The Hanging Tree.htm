<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 gnarled old tree has served as an execution place for decades. Are the 
ghosts lurking under the shade of the tree merely memories of unhappy 
events, or are they more real than that?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">Background for the DM</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2005-18%20-%20The%20Hanging%20Tree_files/hangtree_med.jpg" border="0" align="right" height="213" width="216">The
 hanging tree has a well-deserved reputation as an unsavory landmark and
 is best avoided on dark nights or any time the powers of evil have 
representatives abroad in the land. Unfortunately, avoiding the hanging 
tree isn't always so easy. The tree stands at a fairly well-traveled 
crossroads, and the locals simply try to give the tree a wide berth and 
pass it by as quickly as they can.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 tree has earned its name over the years. It has several thick, 
horizontal branches about 10 feet above the ground, and at least two 
generations of executioners have used these branches as an ideal natural
 gallows. Executions still occur at the tree, and the bodies usually 
hang there for weeks afterward. The bodies warn passersby that criminals
 will pay the ultimate price for their misdeeds if they're caught. In 
fact, the authorities in the area are fond of hanging entire gangs of 
thugs and highwaymen from the tree's branches. The tree, which is old, 
gnarled, and blighted, has a sinister look to it even on the brightest 
days. It presents a truly macabre sight when a whole collection of 
corpses hang from its branches like hideous, rotting fruits.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some
 years ago, a gang of a particularly notorious highwaymen led by Black 
Bryan Battani was executed at the tree. Bryan Battani claimed to the end
 that he was only an honest tradesman from a nearby town. He refused to 
reveal where he hid his ill-gotten gains and insisted that he worked for
 every copper he had. He declared that his wife and daughter would not 
be denied their inheritance.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Several local tales mention the hanging tree:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Black Bryan Battani still lurks near the tree, waiting to rob and kill again to satisfy his lust for gold.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 tree is dangerous, but not because of any ghost. It's the tree itself 
that is evil. It has become twisted from being involved in so much death
 and suffering, and now it kills anyone who ventures beneath its 
branches.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Black
 Bryan Battani hid his lost treasure under the very tree where he was 
executed, and now he remains there still, guarding the loot.</span></li>
<li><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Anyone who eats the roots of the herbs that grow beneath the tree sees a vision of a great treasure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One or more of these rumors could be true, at the DM's option. Be sure to adjust as appropriate below, though.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><span style=" font-size:12px;">The Setup</span></b></span></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If the PCs decide to examine the tree, play up the place's sinister appearance and reputation:</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ancient tree stands gnarled and crooked at the junction of two country 
roads. The roads seem wide and smooth, and someone has taken the trouble
 to keep the shoulders neatly trimmed. The tree, however, rises from a 
mass of tangled bracken. A somber curtain of shadow seems to hang about 
the tree's knobby branches and spotty leaves, leaving the weed-choked 
ground below wrapped in gray gloom. Strands of old, rotted ropes dangle 
from several branches, and these seem to sway unnaturally.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The rancid scent of something dead seems to ooze out from under the tree.</span></p>
</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 ropes hanging from the tree once were used to hang people. The swaying,
 though it seems unnatural, is caused by a natural eddy in the wind 
around here. The smell comes from a thick bed of herbs -- genuine 
mandrakes -- growing under the tree.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Creatures (EL 6, 8, or 9):</b>
 Depending on which local rumors the DM decided are true, nothing could 
be here, or the place could hold an animated tree, or the ghost of Black
 Bryan Battani, or both.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animated tree:</b> hp 66; the tree functions exactly like a tree animated by a treant. Use the treant statistics from page 178 of the <i>Monster Manual,</i> except that the tree has a speed 10 and no skills or feats. On its own, the tree has a CR of 6.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>The Ghost of Black Bryan Battani:</b>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Corrupting Gaze (Su):</b>
 The ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30
 feet. Creatures that meet the ghost's gaze must succeed at a Fortitude 
save (DC 15) or suffer 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of permanent
 Charisma drain.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Malevolence (Su): </b>Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to <i>magic jar</i>
 as cast by a 10th-level sorcerer (or the ghost's character level, 
whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To 
use this ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into
 the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the 
malevolence power does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target 
can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 17). A creature 
that successfully saves is immune to that ghost's malevolence for one 
day, and the ghost cannot enter the target's space. If the save fails, 
the ghost vanishes into the target's body.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Manifestation (Su): </b>Bryan
 Battani's ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane, and as an ethereal 
creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material 
world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and 
becomes visible but incorporeal there. A manifested ghost can strike 
with its touch attack, a ghost touch weapon, or a manifested weapon. A 
manifested ghost also remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where it 
is not incorporeal. It can be attacked by opponents on either the 
Material or Ethereal Plane. The ghost's incorporeality helps protect it 
from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal 
Plane. When manifested, the ghost can be harmed only by other 
incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons, spells, spell-like 
abilities, or supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical 
attack forms and has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal 
source (except for force effects, such as <i>magic missiles, </i>and 
attacks made with ghost touch weapons). A manifested ghost can pass 
through solid objects (but not force effects) at will. Its attacks 
ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, though deflection bonuses and 
force effects work normally. It always moves silently (cannot be heard 
with Listen checks unless desired).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Rejuvenation (Su): </b>Bryan
 Battani's ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old 
haunts in 2d4 days with a successful level check (1d20 + 7) against DC 
16. To prevent the ghost from rejuvenating, Bryan Battani's physical 
remains must be found and buried in his hometown cemetery.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Turn Resistance (Ex): </b>Bryan Battani's ghost is treated as an 11-HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Undead Traits:</b> Bryan Battani's ghost is immune to poison, <i>sleep, </i>paralysis,
 stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting 
effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works 
on objects. It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability 
damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals it, and it
 is not at risk of death from massive damage but is destroyed at 0 hit 
points or less. Bryan Battani's ghost has darkvision (60-foot range). It
 cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ethereal Plane: </b>The
 following changes to the above statistics are in effect against 
opponents on the Ethereal Plane: AC 16, touch 13, flat-footed 16; Atk +8
 melee (1d4+3/19-20, +1 dagger); Str 15.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Possessions:</b> Masterwork studded leather armor, <i>+1 dagger</i>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bryan
 Battani was born to a peasant family nearly a century ago. Just before 
his 12th birthday, he ran away from home, seeking a better life. The 
boy, who was both strong and deft of hand, found work as a blacksmith's 
apprentice. Young Bryan, however, soon grew bored with his trade, and he
 began practicing skills more to his liking, particularly feats of 
legerdemain, picking locks, and pumping information out of neighbors and
 customers without appearing to do so. Eventually, Bryan married his 
master's daughter and took over the shop. He soon began working as a 
locksmith, as well, and he also began his career as a highwayman. He 
left home frequently, telling his wife that he needed to go visit his 
ailing father. He stated that his father was a widower who was too 
stubborn to leave his home and still so angry that his only son ran away
 that he refused to meet his daughter-in-law or granddaughter. Bryan 
continued this charade for many years until finally someone caught him 
while away from home, and he was hanged for his assorted crimes. He kept
 his share of the loot buried in his home garden, and although he spent 
most of it, he left behind a considerable cache of gold. His wife was 
unaware of the treasure, and though Bryan's own granddaughter and her 
blacksmith husband still live comfortably in Bryan's house, they have no
 idea they have a small fortune buried in the garden.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tactics: </b>The
 tree now has an appetite for violence and death. If anyone spends more 
than minute under its branches without attempting to kill anything, it 
attacks itself.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bryan
 Battani's ghost is more subtle. His capture and execution still galls 
him, and he yearns to be buried decently in his adopted town's cemetery.
 When anyone approaches the tree, Bryan hides on the Ethereal Plane and 
observes the group. After a few rounds, he chooses someone who resembles
 his living self (usually a fighter or rogue) and attacks using his 
malevolence power. (If the hanging tree animates and attacks, Bryan uses
 that event as a cover for his malevolence attack.) If he gets control 
of a character's body, he does his best to masquerade as that character,
 but he also insists that the characters dig at the base of tree. Bryan 
hopes to find his bones just below the surface. His bones do lie there, 
along with bones from dozens of other hanging victims. Bryan knows his 
own bones and insists on collecting them and taking them back to his 
hometown for burial. If discovered, Bryan threatens to kill every 
character in the party, using as many "borrowed" bodies as it takes. If 
the characters seem willing to negotiate, Bryan offers them a share of 
his treasure. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Treasure:</b>
 The herbs growing under the hanging tree have some commercial value. 
Anyone can dig up about 50 gp worth. A Knowledge (nature) or Profession 
(herbalist) check (DC 15) allows a character to harvest an extra 150 gp 
worth of herbs from under the tree due to the character's ability to 
efficiently deal with the plants.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Bryan
 Battani's treasure is appropriate to the encounter's EL. (It is a level
 8 or 9 treasure.) The PCs have no way of learning about this treasure 
unless Bryan tells them, and Bryan insists on splitting the loot 50-50.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Development: </b>A
 skilled and trustworthy player might get a kick out of playing Bryan 
Battani while Bryan controls his or her PC's body. Characters who show 
up in the home of Bryan's granddaughter looking for treasure have to be 
very sneaky, or very persuasive, or both.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 notorious highwayman's granddaughter (NE human Exp2/Ro 1) has a bit of 
her grandfather's talent for deception and she possesses a larcenous 
heart. She watches the PCs carefully if they visit, since she is curious
 to know what they really want, and she never takes anyone at face 
value. She has buried a smaller treasure gained through her own wits and
 deft hands in another spot in the garden. If the PCs start digging, she
 immediately suspects that they are after her treasure.</span></p>
