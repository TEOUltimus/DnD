<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>To Raise or Not to Raise?</b></p>
<p align="left">The twin topics for this installment of <i>Save My Game</i>
 are the effect that character death has on adventures and what happens 
to a dead character's treasure if he's not raised. Most PCs want to have
 their dead companions restored to life so that they can continue 
adventuring together. But sometimes they must make a choice between 
doing so and completing the adventure successfully. What's a DM to do?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: What Happens to the Adventure When a Character Dies?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>If it's acceptable to kill off PCs, how do you handle
 their absence from the adventure, whether temporary or permanent? If 
the players choose not to try life-restoring magic, how do you handle 
the disposition of the dead character's possessions?-Bart</b></p>
<p align="left">In the last installment of <i>Save My Game,</i> we 
looked at the question of whether or not to kill PCs in your campaign. 
But even if you try your best to avoid PC death, it's likely to happen 
at least occasionally. So let's look at some of the key campaign issues 
that arise in such cases.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: The Plot Must Go on</b></p>
<p align="left">Every <b>D&amp;D</b> adventure is an ongoing story with 
at least a general plotline, and in most cases, the planned action 
doesn't include trips back to town to get dead characters raised. So how
 can you handle this temporary deviation from your storyline? Must the 
PCs drop what they're doing to get their comrade brought back? Will they
 all go to town, or just a few of them? In the latter case, what will 
the rest of the party do in the meantime? Does the campaign simply stall
 while the party deals with a casualty?</p>
<p align="left">If you're running an open-ended dungeon campaign, such as <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i> or <i>Ruins of Undermountain, </i>a
 temporary lapse in the action is no problem because the adventure 
always proceeds at the party's convenience. The site of the action is 
just a dungeon waiting to be cleared. If the party clears out rooms 1 
through 19 and then the rogue is killed by the giant in room 20, the PCs
 can simply leave, raise her, and return to start up again in room 21 --
 or perhaps in some other part of the dungeon. In such a case, the trip 
back to town is no big deal.</p>
<p align="left">But the situation is different if the campaign has a 
timeline that calls for rapid-fire events. In that sort of adventure, 
PCs who take time off to have dead companions raised will fall behind, 
and such delays can have potentially disastrous consequences. For 
instance, characters investigating an assassination plot may have to 
choose between reviving a comrade and preventing the intended murder if 
time is short. Or an evil cult may succeed in reviving its long-dead god
 with a forbidden ritual if not stopped in time. In such cases, parties 
that spend too much time going back and forth to town to resurrect dead 
comrades may fail to stop the bad guys in time. </p>
<p align="left">If your adventures tend toward the latter type, you need
 to take a hard look at your DMing style and the kinds of scenarios you 
offer. If you choose to put time limits on success and you know you have
 a habit of killing characters, make sure to build in extra time so that
 PCs can get dead characters raised -- perhaps even several times, 
depending on the scale of the adventure.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: What Happens to the Dead Guy's Stuff?</b></p>
<p align="left">Suppose the party doesn't have the dead character raised. Then what happens? </p>
<p align="left">In the archetypical fantasy death scene, the hero dies 
with his boots on and is buried with full battle honors. Also known as 
the Viking Funeral Rule, this approach to character death decrees that 
when a character dies, all his stuff "dies" with him. Items for joint 
party use -- such as healing potions or <i>bags of holding</i> -- that 
the dead hero might be carrying are exempt from burial, and exceptions 
can also be made for special "plot items" the dead character had that 
are needed to complete the mission. The general idea, however, is that 
heroes don't pillage their dead comrades.</p>
<p align="left">But hey, this is a <b>D&amp;D</b> game, not an adventure
 novel. "Waste not, want not" is the adventurer's creed, and treasure is
 treasure. Why stick your friend in the ground and let all that loot go 
to waste? That concept may not be very heroic, but adventuring is a war 
of sorts, and wars leave no time for pleasantries such as honorable 
burial. So the most common result is that the PCs strip the corpse and 
divvy up the loot, just as they would with any other dead person they 
came across.</p>
<p align="left">This method, however, can throw off the balance of 
treasure in the party -- particularly if only the characters whose 
players happen to be present during that game session are included in 
the division. Even if the loot is divided among all the party members --
 possibly after selling all the items for cash -- everyone still gets a 
pretty big chunk of change. After all, typical PC wealth tends to be 
higher than the net worth of the average monster or NPC.</p>
<p align="left">But why should extra PC treasure present a problem for 
the campaign? The answer is that, assuming a party of four, each of the 
three survivors now has 1/3 more wealth than he really should. And since
 the replacement character who joins the party to bring its number back 
up to four also has equipment, you now have four characters with enough 
treasure for five. In that case, you might need to adjust the ELs for 
your encounters to reflect the fact that the PCs now have more resources
 than a typical party would. </p>
<p align="left">The other problem is that the replacement character 
doesn't get a cut of the dead person's treasure and is therefore more 
likely to die than the survivors are. After all, even if the newbie is 
the same character level as the rest of the group, she has fewer 
resources with which to fortify herself. (The same is true for PCs who 
sell off possessions to fund resurrections -- they end up behind the 
rest of the party in terms of treasure.) In that sense, character death 
can be even worse for the player than for the character, because any 
replacement PC ends up behind.</p>
<p align="left">To address this issue, you and your players should sit 
down and decide exactly what will happen in the campaign when a PC dies.
 You can rule that each character must have a will that stipulates what 
happens to his possessions -- perhaps they will go to a relative who 
then becomes the replacement character, or to an organization. Party 
contracts or charters are also an option for dealing with the situation 
fairly. Or you can stipulate that the cultural values about the dead in 
the campaign require a certain disposition of goods. Whatever in-game 
solution you choose, everyone knows what will happen ahead of time, 
before any argument can ensue.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Character death can disrupt a storyline by forcing 
characters to choose between completing a timed mission and having a 
companion raised. To minimize such campaign effects, build in some extra
 time for trips back to town, or simply ensure that your adventures can 
occur at the characters' convenience.</p>
<p align="left">Should the PCs decide not to raise a dead companion, 
they are likely to loot the body and split up the proceeds, thereby 
creating a treasure imbalance between themselves and any replacement PC.
 Such an imbalance raises the chances of death for the new character and
 forces the DM to adjust the ELs of encounters to account for the 
party's extra resources. A frank discussion of this prospect with the 
players is in order here, so that a logical in-game solution that does 
not unbalance the party can be found.</p>
<p align="left">In the next installment, we'll talk about how to 
introduce and integrate a new character into the campaign. PC death is 
certainly not the only reason that new characters come into a campaign, 
but it's one of the more common ones.</p>
