<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Vow of Poverty, Part 2</h4>
<p><i>The Vow of Poverty is a great feat in terms of character 
development and roleplaying ops, but the feat seems to be unbalanced 
when taken by Monk and Druid characters as they aren't giving that much 
up and gaining abilities that stack with their own.</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Lukas, from Ask Wizards</p>
<p>To continue the discussion about <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20060609a">Vow of Poverty</a>,
 what about the fact that it seems to be more beneficial for some 
classes -- monk and druid being the most obvious ones? The rule is 
specific in what you are allowed to keep -- clothes, simple weapons 
(though, amusingly, there is no limit on how many weapons you can have),
 a sack, one day of food and water, and a spell component pouch. That's 
it. Nothing else. Period. If you have a class that can make do with 
that, you're golden. If not, Vow of Poverty will wreck you. You can 
divide how the classes mesh with Vow of Poverty more or less like this: </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2006-16%20-%20Vow%20of%20Poverty,%20Part%202_files/sg_20060616a_druid.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="240" width="200"><b>Perfect Fit:</b>
 Druid, Monk, Sorcerer. These classes allow you to fight well without 
weapons and don't rely much on armor for protection. Not too many druid 
spells have divine focus requirements (a divine focus is not a spell 
component), and for some of those, the focus is something natural like a
 pool of water. A sorcerer can just avoid choosing spells that require 
expensive components or a divine focus. </p>
<p><b>Some Problems, but Still a Pretty Good Fit:</b> Bard, Ranger, 
Rogue. These classes have abilities that work well with no armor, and 
the characters can get by with simple weapons. They're not the optimal 
choices, but it doesn't hurt too badly. Bardic music can be done with 
singing and bards can choose non-focus-requiring spells. </p>
<p><b>You Can Make It Work, But It's a Big Handicap:</b> Barbarian, 
Cleric, Fighter, Paladin. These classes rely substantially on 
versatility in weapons and armor. Clerics have a lot of spells with 
divine foci, so it's hard to avoid them. Paladins and clerics cannot 
turn undead without a holy symbol. </p>
<p><b>Not in a Million Years:</b> Wizard. Two words: no spellbook. 'Nuff said. </p>
<p>This is not too dissimilar from the situation characters might find 
themselves in if they somehow get separated from their equipment -- 
marooned in a shipwreck, captured and sent to the dungeons, or chained 
on a slave ship, etc. The monk really needs nothing to be effective. 
Sure she can be more effective with all of her stuff, but she can get by
 without it. A druid or sorcerer (especially with the Eschew Materials 
feat) is likewise fine. Other classes are at graduated levels of being 
pooched, up to the wizard, who is useless without his spellbook. Even 
Spell Mastery is like a life preserver in the ocean for a wizard. You 
can hold on and maybe survive for a while, but it's tough. </p>
<p>If the adventure calls for characters to be separated from their 
stuff, that's a decision the DM makes in the knowledge that some 
characters will be better able to compensate for it than others, and 
it's a short-term issue. Some characters will be better able to deal 
with it than others. For example, if you're in an undead-heavy area, 
clerics are going to rule and rogues are going to drool. As long as it's
 temporary, and it isn't always the same characters getting the shaft or
 being advantaged, then it's OK. When characters lose their stuff, at 
some point they get it back or find, steal, or buy new stuff. Vow of 
Poverty, on the other hand, lasts as long as the PC survives, so you 
can't say "just wait, it'll get better." </p>
<p><b>Vow of Poverty and Armor Class</b></p>
<p>The relative value of Vow of Poverty changes for classes based on 
their inherent abilities in part because of what the cost would be to 
replace that benefit with your normal abilities. The simplest example is
 the exalted AC bonus, which is essentially equivalent to an armor 
bonus. A class that can wear armor can 'buy' Armor Class much more 
cheaply than a class that can't. Consider the following comparison for 
buying a +8 armor bonus to armor class --</p>
<ul>
<li><i>+8 bracers of armor</i> = 64,000 gp;</li>
<li>a <i>+4 chain shirt</i> = 16,250 gp;</li>
<li>normal full plate = 1,500 gp</li>
<li>normal splint mail + a normal, large wooden shield = 207 gp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, exalted armor bonus has none of the hindrances of wearing 
armor on movement, Dexterity bonus, skills, feats, or class abilities 
that are limited by armor, so it's better than just wearing armor. In 
terms of pure AC, you see that a sorcerer or monk gets a bonus that 
would cost a massive premium -- more than 300 times what it would cost 
for a fighter, cleric, or paladin to duplicate or supersede the same AC 
bonus. </p>
<p>As a solution, you might suggest that proficiency in heavier armor or
 membership in armor-bearing classes might increase your exalted bonus 
to Armor Class (maybe +1 for light, +2 for medium, +3 for heavy, and 
another +1 for shield proficiency), either at the outset or with an 
increased rate of gain. </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2006-16%20-%20Vow%20of%20Poverty,%20Part%202_files/sg_20060616a_monk.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="297" width="200"><b>Vow of Poverty in Alternate Forms</b></p>
<p>It gets better when you consider that Vow of Poverty abilities appear
 to be portable across changes in shape and form -- it's as though every
 armor or shield had the Wild special ability and every other item a <i>wilding clasp</i>. Sure, the massive 'abusability' of wild shape and <i>polymorph</i>
 and similar spells has been drastically reined in recently, but there 
are still plenty of places for shapechangers to cheat, cheat, cheat! 
That means Vow of Poverty gives more advantages to characters who can 
change shape -- cue the druid and the sorcerer (and a variety of 
prestige classes such as Bear Warrior, Lion of Talisid, Sentinel of 
Bharrai, and Warshaper). A monk obviously has no shapechanging 
abilities, though his unarmed attacks and monk AC bonus are functional 
equivalents to an alternate form's natural armor and natural attacks. </p>
<p>Note, however, that nowhere is there an explicit statement that Vow 
of Poverty benefits carry over across various forms. Any DM could impose
 a rule that the bonuses are tied to a character's natural form and that
 shapechanging temporarily forfeits or reduces some benefits (especially
 physical ability score bonuses, exalted AC bonus, and natural armor). </p>
<p><b>Exalted Feats</b></p>
<p>A side problem is that exalted feats show class favoritism. A large 
number are equally useful for anyone (including the long list of Sacred 
Vow-based feats and a few generic combat-related feats). Paladins 
(fittingly enough) have the most class-relevant ones, but druids and 
monks are right behind. Clerics and rangers have a few each, and rogues,
 barbarians, sorcerers, and wizards really have only one each. Because a
 significant part of the Vow of Poverty benefits is the accumulation of 
exalted feats, players who spend some time developing exalted feats that
 are relevant to the class abilities of other classes will be rewarded. </p>
<p><b>One Size Does Not Fit All</b></p>
<p>The best fit for balancing Vow of Poverty is probably not any of the 
above but instead an acknowledgement that Vow of Poverty as written 
greatly favors druids, monks, and sorcerers. Tweaking the poverty 
benefits to equally fit everyone is not realistic. A better solution is 
to do one of the following: </p>
<ol>
<li><i>Develop a personalized list with the player:</i> You probably 
have only one PC with this vow. Don't waste your time rewriting an 
entire rule set. Work with that person, see what he would like to be 
able to do, what kind of character he would like to create, his reasons 
for adopting voluntary poverty for his character, and develop a list and
 a progression that fits that unique PC's situation.</li>
<li><i>Develop specialized vows:</i> This is hard to do solely on the 
basis of class when PCs multiclass so often, but you could develop 
several styles to fit different types of characters -- perhaps one or 
two for each good alignment. Each list could have a particular flavor 
for why the character adopted poverty and the path they are following, 
with different benefits (though many may be similar across lists).</li>
<li><i>Make the system modular:</i> Reformat the ability progression 
table in the form of 'slots' rather than set abilities. You could make 
each Vow of Poverty ability an exalted feat (with Vow of Poverty as a 
prerequisite) or a class ability (like a rogue's special abilities at 
10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels). As a character advances, she selects
 the new exalted abilities that best fit the character. Some might go 
for more AC bonuses, some for more attack bonuses, some for protections,
 and on down the list. This would require the DM to generate more 
abilities so that PCs with the feat have alternatives from which to 
select, but this way, players can essentially build their own structure 
of benefits, as they can with a character's feat selections.</li>
</ol>
