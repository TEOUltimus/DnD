<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Low-Level, High-Damage Characters</h4><i><p>I have 
the issue of being a new DM, and having a party of 6 level 7characters. 
Unfortunately I have given too much loot (magic items, gold and XP) and 
they now throttle anything that I throw at them even CR 9 creatures.</p>
<p>The main problem is, that they need opponents that hit often and 
medium to hard hits, with a low AC and a lot of hit points. I am trying 
to stat monsters to challenge them in interesting settings. But, to my 
dismay, everything that I throw at them dies fast. The PC's hit hard but
 cannot hit high AC's (greater the 22) with a reasonable frequency, 
disregarding 2 characters. How can I stat these cool monsters to 
challenge but not mutilate them?</p></i><p align="right">-- Michael, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>This kind of continues the 'large party' discussion from <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20060630a">last column</a>.
 Many of the principles there apply here as well. Your characters are 
overpowered relative to their level because they have more equipment 
than would be expected in the standard rules. How bad of a problem is 
this really? </p>
<p><b>1. A Natural Give and Take</b></p>
<p>The problem will correct itself with time, as long as you approach 
campaign design appropriately. If you have been over-generous with magic
 and treasure now, then tighten the purse strings for a while. The 
players might say, "Hey, that's not fair!" Well, too bad. It wasn't fair
 when you gave them too much, but are they offering to give the overage 
back? It's like a pro athlete who holds out for more money when he has a
 good season but wouldn't think of giving money back if he has a crummy 
season. </p>
<p>The problem is also self-correcting within the rule system, in that 
the characters should advance more rapidly in level if you hand out 
standard xp awards. They are beating up encounters whose CR exceeds 
theirs, so it shouldn't take too long for their level to catch up to 
their wealth. You could, of course, penalize the characters in awarding 
experience -- treating them as if they were, say, a level higher than 
their actual level to reflect their overly powerful state -- but this 
only makes the problem worse, not better. Go ahead and let their levels 
catch up and your sense of balance is restored. </p>
<p><b><img src="2006%20-%2007-07%20-%20Low%20Level,%20High%20Damage_files/sg_20060707a_tt.jpg" alt="A Tempting Target?" title="A Tempting Target?" align="right" border="0" height="325" width="200">2. A Tempting Target</b></p>
<p>If you feel as if you've been too free about giving things away, 
realize that cunning NPCs may notice the same thing. Perhaps the party, 
laden with loot and throwing a lot of money around in town on magic 
items (buying and/or selling) attracts the attention of the local 
thieves' guild. They won't bother with a straight-up fight with the PCs 
-- that would be suicide. They might very well send a couple of rogues 
with maxed out Sleight of Hand, including skill-boosting items and 
synergy bonuses, along with perhaps a magic item allowing them to <i>dimension door</i>
 away with their ill-gotten gains, to pinch an item or three from the 
party. You might also set up the PCs with counterfeit items, coins, or 
gems in a business deal. Unless they are very attentive with Appraise 
skills, you might swap out some of their excess wealth for worthless 
junk. </p>
<p>In combat, don't forget about having creatures disarm and sunder 
items in the PCs' possession. Don't limit it to weapons, either. If a PC
 has a wand or staff in her hand, that should be fair game for 
sundering. Drop in a few item-destroying monsters while you're at it. </p>
<p>This is a heavy-handed way to go about it, and you certainly 
shouldn't mess with the party's stuff on a regular basis. They've worked
 hard to achieve it. At least, normally that's the case. You imply that 
this is not the case here, that they have essentially lucked into stuff 
they have no business having, so you have a little more ethical leeway 
in reversing the bounty. The players might complain that the treasure 
hauls are your fault -- after all, you gave them the stuff -- and they 
shouldn't be punished for your mistake. But hey, <b>D&amp;D</b> is a 
team game, a cooperative game. If everybody isn't into takebacks and 
givebacks, then you use the weapons at your disposal within the rules to
 deal with it. </p>
<p><b>3. Are They Really as Overpowered as All That?</b></p>
<p>Maybe in some ways but not in others. Hitting a high AC is part of 
the higher-level game. If the characters can't rumble with monsters that
 have good AC, how are they wiping the floor with your CR 9 opponents? 
If you want low-AC, high-HP foes, go for giant vermin and dire animals 
or summoners who have called up celestial or fiendish versions of the 
same. They're relatively easy to hit but they're made of hit points, so 
they can soak up the damage while being reasonably able to dish out some
 danger. </p>
<p>The problem that you're really experiencing is that the characters 
themselves are out of balance. They have excess killpower, but only 
within limits. Things outside their kill-range will stomp them into the 
ground. The PCs are fragile relative to their killing power, which makes
 combat more binary. Either they stomp or get stomped. There are no 
long, hard slugfests, which seem to be what you want. </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2007-07%20-%20Low%20Level,%20High%20Damage_files/sg_20060707a_way.jpg" alt="Just answer the question!" title="Just answer the question!" align="right" border="0" height="310" width="200"><b>4. OK, What About Your Actual Question?</b></p>
<p>Your best option, which was one of the points touched on last time, 
is to spread out the combat. Pay more attention to the EL of the 
encounter than the CR of the individual monsters. You are looking for an
 encounter that will be challenging. This can be done better by looking 
at the encounter holistically, including the terrain, environment, and 
situation (e.g., ambush, running battle, close quarters) rather than by 
focusing on a signature 'tough' or 'cool' monster to try to beat the 
entire party at once. </p>
<p>The first way of overcoming high damage output is by making it 
irrelevant. Don't try to over-CR the characters with one super-tough 
opponent that will either slaughter them (if its AC or special attacks 
are too extreme) or get slaughtered by them (if they can gang up on it).
 Give them several (or even a gaggle of) fairly tough opponents at once.
 Instead of one fire giant, send a dozen minotaurs. Instead of a 
juvenile green dragon, a small pack of manticores, displacer beasts, or 
harpies. It doesn't matter that a fighter can dish out 40 points of 
damage with a single hit if her opponent has only 15 hit points. A 
high-damage character that can attack once per round needs at least four
 rounds to finish off four opponents. In those four rounds, the fighter 
should be attacked 10 times vs. the four attacks he'll make. Even if 
those 10 attacks have low odds of hitting, a few are bound to get 
through (and 10 rolls means 10 chances for critical hits). </p>
<p>Second, diffuse the focus of combat. Don't bunch up the foes at one 
point where the PCs can concentrate their forces against them. Have 
enemies attack from different directions at the same time, have 
opponents attack in waves, or do both. By attacking from multiple 
directions, you force characters to utilize both their tactical 
sensibilities and their versatility, because characters who are best at 
ranged attacks may be forced into melee, while a melee character drawn 
off to fight one foe must, after defeating it, maneuver back into the 
fight. </p>
<p>Third, mix and match the monsters you use. Be aware of the tactical 
capabilities of your PCs, and don't just throw things at them that are 
right in their wheelhouse, so to speak. If they're awesome at melee but 
not so good at ranged combat, attack them with enemies that are 
dangerous at range or with enemies who attack and then hide or move away
 before becoming engaged. Use combined-arms tactics where it makes sense
 -- a mix of ranged attackers, spellcasters, melee fighters, and 
creatures with complementary special abilities. (Of course, monsters are
 what they are. Not every encounter should be against the goblins' 
regimental combat team of mixed cavalry, archers, and pikes.) By 
presenting a more complex tactical problem for the characters than 
'charge up and smash it,' you make things more difficult for them 
without necessarily upping the chances for a party-wide wipeout. You can
 tax their ability without necessarily threatening utter destruction. </p>
