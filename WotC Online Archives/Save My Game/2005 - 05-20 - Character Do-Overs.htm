<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>To Redo or Not to Redo</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The topic for this installment of <i>Save My Game</i> is
 what to do when some players take more care in developing their 
characters than others do. Player preparedness shows in combat, and 
statistically, the characters of players who strive to make the most of 
their characters' abilities do better than the characters of those who 
don't. But the players who get the short end of the stick over and over 
because they didn't prepare may become disenchanted with the game. 
What's a DM to do?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Variations in Player Preparedness</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>How does one handle a group of well-established 
characters when some of them are well planned and developed, and others 
-- well -- aren't? Player preparation tends to show in combat and can 
often mean the difference between character life and death. What's a DM 
supposed to do when three players have done their homework well enough 
to make sure their characters achieve the desired results, and the 
fourth one hasn't? -- Adapted from a post made by Icewraith on the 
D&amp;D boards on the Wizards of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The results of preparation tend to be as obvious in a <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game as they are in real life. As a case in point, I once added a great
 deal of supplemental material -- especially spells -- to a 2nd-edition <b>AD&amp;D</b>
 campaign I ran. One of my players took it upon himself to study the new
 material carefully and learn exactly what it could do for his 
character. As a result, his cleric frequently trotted out some new bit 
of magic that the rest of the party had never even heard of, evoking 
cries of "How'd you do that?" from the other players. Others who ran 
clerics (or whose characters had cleric henchmen) did not put nearly as 
much time and effort into exploring what their characters could do with 
the expanded material available to them, so they didn't gain the 
advantages it would have provided.</p>
<p align="LEFT">From the viewpoint of game play, the advantage that the 
well-prepared player gains is a just reward. It's perfectly fair that a 
player who puts in the time to study should reap a benefit for it. As 
far as in-game logic, however, it seems odd that one character is so 
much more effective than another of the same class and level just 
because one player has more time to spend on character development than 
the other. Likewise, why should a henchman be less adept at what he does
 than a PC just because the player chooses to spend more time working on
 his own character? </p>
<p align="LEFT">In general, these are the kinds of arguments that 
players tend to make when they're unhappy about the advantages the 
well-prepared player earns. Some may accuse the DM of showing 
favoritism; others may just claim that it's unfair when certain 
characters constantly come out on top. Such players tend to be 
proponents of sharing rewards equally, and many are only too happy to 
cash in on the benefits earned by a better-prepared player if they can.</p>
<p align="LEFT">It's true that characters are not real and thus have 
only as much life and sparkle as a player brings to them. But what's a 
DM to do when, for whatever reason, the sparkles don't fall evenly?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Don't Try to Fix It</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">That's right -- leave the situation alone and let the 
chips fall where they may. Players are the ones who make their 
characters, and if they don't like the decisions they've made, that's 
too bad. They have a wide range of choices available to them when 
creating characters, and it's their responsibility to choose wisely. You
 can't create or play their characters for them, and they probably 
wouldn't want you to. So make sure you're available to give advice when 
they want it, but otherwise let your players develop a degree of 
self-reliance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Don't Punish Players for Making Mistakes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">On the other hand, <b>D&amp;D</b> is a game, and it 
should be fun for everyone. If a player isn't having fun, don't make him
 play his way through the mess he's created just to prove a point. 
Sometimes it's better to let him change or even completely rebuild his 
character -- perhaps with some active advice from you or more 
experienced players.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Players who have put in the time and effort to develop 
their characters properly may be annoyed if someone who slacked off 
earlier gets the chance to rebuild instead of reaping his just rewards. 
The point is valid, since you are in fact giving the unprepared player 
special treatment. But before you cave in to the pressure, analyze the 
situation and try to discern the real source of the complaining player's
 objections. Maybe she enjoys playing a dominant character and doesn't 
appreciate weaker characters getting a chance to catch up. Or maybe she 
simply enjoys the advantage that her superior rules knowledge gives her.
 If you encounter such a situation, remind all your players that they 
should be working together to advance, not trying to play petty power 
games.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: New Choices Mean New Regrets</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Bringing in new material partway through a campaign can 
revitalize your world. Play becomes more fun, surprising, and exciting 
because the PCs no longer know exactly what to expect from their 
opponents. But when you bring out your latest new rules supplement, it's
 only natural for your players to want some of the new feats, prestige 
classes, and so forth too. (After all, you get to use them!) But what 
happens if the character has already passed the point at which she could
 have gained the desired option? Are you really going to tell the player
 that the character would have had to choose a different feat three 
levels ago to get the nifty new ability? You're within your rights to do
 so -- that is, after all, what the rules actually say. But how could 
the player have planned for this option when it didn't exist at the 
critical time in the character's career? The introduction of new rules 
can be frustrating for your players if you won't give the PCs a chance 
to access the new options that their opponents suddenly have available.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Instead, you might offer all the players a chance to 
"retcon" their characters a bit when you introduce new rules options. 
Not only does this technique let all the players have access to new 
options, but it also provides a perfect opportunity for the player who 
didn't do such a good job with the initial character design to redo it 
without getting "special treatment." </p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Experience Is a Harsh Teacher</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Sometimes a player designs a character that looks great 
on paper but performs very poorly in actual play. The problem wasn't 
really bad planning; the character just didn't work out as well as the 
player anticipated. Or maybe the campaign just took a different 
direction than she expected, and class abilities or feats or character 
concepts that initially sounded cool and fun turned out to be useless, 
boring, or just a bad fit. Proper DM-player communication can often 
avert the latter situation, but some problems become apparent only in 
play. Thus, a good campaign should include a way to fix a character (or 
dump it in favor of a new one) when player choices just don't work out.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 5: Can We Fix It? Yes, We Can!</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You can also build some specific fixes for poor character design into your campaign. The psionic power <i>psychic reformation</i>
 lets the user partially "reformat" a previous character level by 
changing skill point allocations, feats, and psionic powers. Don't use 
psionics? It should be relatively easy to create a spell for arcane or 
divine casters that would serve the same purpose, and some existing 
spells might also make such an option available. For example, you could 
allow<i> limited wish</i> to make changes such as these available, and even let characters change past class choices. By the same logic, <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>
 might allow even more extensive changes. Spells such as these aren't 
cheap, but they do offer an in-game mechanism for character redesign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">On the other hand, you could just be a super-nice DM and
 let players redesign their characters whenever they feel they need to 
do so. But if you choose this option, always ask why it has to be done. 
Such profound changes to existing characters shouldn't be random or 
opportunistic. ("Oh, we're fighting a dragon? Can my ranger change his 
favored enemy?") So give the player a chance to make an argument for why
 the change should be allowed, and to explain how the alterations remain
 faithful to the original concept of the character.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Differences in player preparedness result in highly 
predictable variations in character viability. Specifically, the 
characters of players who take the time to design their characters' 
capabilities well have a distinct advantage over the characters of those
 who don't. But is such an advantage logical within the game setting? 
Why should one 3rd-level cleric know his stuff so much better than 
another?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even players who haven't taken the time to learn their 
characters' abilities well can change that situation and do so. But the 
players who took enough time to build great characters from the start 
are likely to come out ahead of the one who didn't, and that fact can 
cause the time-challenged player to lose interest in the game 
eventually.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This sort of problem can be insuperable without an 
opportunity for redesign. You can provide no options at all and let the 
chips fall where they may, but you may very well lose a player by 
handling the situation that way. Alternatively, you can simply let the 
player redesign his character, but such "special treatment" may evoke 
complaints from the other players. Introducing new game material is a 
good opportunity to let all the players redesign their characters at 
once without seeming unfair. Or you can build opportunities for redesign
 into the fabric of the campaign by introducing magical or psionic ways 
to alter past choices. Finally, you can just allow any player to 
redesign a character at any time, but only with a good reason and only 
in a way that remains faithful to the concept of the character.</p>
