<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game! </p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Alignment: Rules for Lawful and Chaotic Characters</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The last column dealt with the kind of alignment issues 
that tend to disrupt games -- primarily PC infighting and disagreements 
about behavior. The topics for this installment of <i>Save My Game</i> 
are law and chaos-two frequently misunderstood alignment components that
 every player seems to interpret differently, particularly in relation 
to a character who has a strict code of conduct, such as a paladin. 
What's a DM to do?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Problem: Lawful and Chaotic -- What Do They Really Mean?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>I've seen a lot of discussion on the D&amp;D boards 
lately about law and chaos -- particularly about how they relate to 
paladins and their behavior. What exactly is expected of a paladin? What
 actions may cause her to lose her class abilities? I understand that 
blatantly evil acts such as murder, mayhem, stealing, and the like 
violate her code, but what about poor judgment that causes harm to 
others? What about opting to save herself rather than someone else? I 
know a paladin should care more about the welfare of others than she 
does about herself, but how far does that concept go? I also wonder 
about a paladin's relationship to the law. Must she adhere to the letter
 of the law? Can a paladin ignore an unjust law? -- Susan</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This question goes right to the heart of what lawful and
 chaotic mean in terms of alignment, so let's begin by taking a close 
look at those two ideas.</p>
<p align="LEFT">First of all, let's be clear about one important 
concept: Lawful does not necessarily mean "adheres to the letter of the 
law." A law (or body of laws) is merely a rule that a government imposes
 on those who are subject to its power. A lawful alignment, on the other
 hand, represents an orderly approach to matters of ethics and personal 
conduct. Most lawful characters do respect the order that the laws of 
the realm represent, but adherence to local ordinances is only one way 
of demonstrating a lawful alignment.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To be lawful is to be in favor of conformity and 
consistency, to act in a systematic and uniform fashion, and to take 
responsibility. As a lawful person, you establish patterns and 
precedents and stick to them unless you can see a good reason to do 
otherwise. Methodical efficiency is your byword, and you believe in the 
concept of duty. You plan and organize your activities to achieve 
particular goals, not just to satisfy impulsive desires. You believe a 
proper way exists to accomplish any goal, though it may not always be 
the traditional, tried-and-true way. Likewise, you cultivate long-term 
relationships and endeavor to build trust between your associates and 
yourself. As a lawful person, you recognize that most laws have valid 
purposes that promote social order, but you are not necessarily bound to
 obey them to the letter. In particular, if you are both good and 
lawful, you have no respect for a law is unfair or capricious.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Being chaotic, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily 
mean you are incapable of adhering to the law. Though chaotic societies 
may seem disorderly, they exist in abundance. As a chaotic character, 
you are dedicated to personal and societal freedom. You pursue your 
dreams and don't try to put limits on your nature. You don't value 
consistency for its own sake; rather, you respond to every situation as 
you see fit without worrying about what you did before. The past is the 
past and the future is uncertain, so you prefer to live in the present. 
Each situation is new, so planning and procedures are pointless -- in 
fact, they restrain people from reacting quickly and decisively. You 
don't get tied up in exclusive relationships because they could hold you
 back from your destiny -- which might be right around the corner. You 
are always ready to try new techniques because you believe that 
experience is the best teacher, and you are always open to discovery.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In short, good and evil describe a character's ideals, 
and law and chaos describe the means she uses to work toward her goals. 
The law of the land in any given place is most likely designed to 
promote social order, so in general terms, lawful characters are more 
likely to respect it than chaotic characters are. However, the content 
of the law matters much more than its mere existence.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 1: Laws and the PC</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Any character might fear the consequences of breaking a 
local law, especially when the authorities rule with an iron hand. Very 
few characters, however, should make important decisions based solely on
 the legality of the choices. For a lawful good character such as a 
paladin, achieving goals in the right way -- that is, in a way that 
promotes the general welfare and doesn't unnecessarily imperil others --
 is the most important consideration. For a chaotic character, the most 
expedient action is generally the most appropriate one, whether or not 
it is legal. A chaotic good character takes pains to ensure that others 
are not harmed by his actions, but a chaotic neutral or chaotic evil one
 cares about little besides personal convenience.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 2: The Paladin's Code</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Now let's address the question of how the paladin's code
 of conduct governs her actions. A paladin is both lawful and good, and 
she must uphold both aspects of her alignment. Thus, if the laws in a 
particular realm are corrupt and evil, she is under no obligation to 
obey them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Though a paladin must always strive to bring about a 
just and righteous outcome, she is not omnipotent. If someone tricks her
 into acting in a way that harms the innocent, or if an action of hers 
accidentally brings about a calamity, she may rightly feel that she is 
at fault. But although she should by all means attempt to redress the 
wrong, she should not lose her paladinhood for it. Intent is not always 
easy to judge, but as long as a paladin's heart was in the right place 
and she took reasonable precautions, she cannot be blamed for a poor 
result.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Should a paladin sacrifice herself to save others? In 
the broadest sense, yes, since doing so is the ultimate act of good. 
However, she must also have enough respect for her own life and ability 
to make sure that her sacrifice brings about a significant benefit for 
others. A paladin who holds the only key to saving the world should not 
sacrifice herself needlessly against an orc horde. As long as the 
paladin keeps the greater good in mind, she is adhering to her code.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When your character has a decision to make, weigh all 
the factors carefully and take her alignment into consideration when 
deciding what is most important to her. In short, make your decision, 
have a reason for it, but don't tie the concepts of law and chaos to the
 local law of the land.</p>
