<p align="left"><b>In my Eberron campaign, I have an artificer who is 
going crazy building all sorts of stuff! I have tried to double-check 
his work, but so many rules have to be taken into consideration that I 
don't have time to vet them as thoroughly as I'd like. Why is construct 
construction so very complicated? How can I control his constant 
building of constructs, and do any limits exist on his ability to 
command them? Should I just limit the creation of constructs to NPCs? --
 Adapted from a post by Pseudolife on the D&amp;D message boards of the 
Wizards of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="left">The artificer class provides a great deal of grist for a
 player's creativity mill, particularly when it comes to building 
constructs. The constructs already published for the game are well 
defined and relatively simple to use as opponents for PCs, but when a PC
 gains control of several constructs, he can create a serious headache 
for the DM. And when he strikes out on his own to build new and better 
constructs, the difficulty of managing them can increase still more. But
 handled correctly, the artificer and his constructs can add a dimension
 of enjoyment to a campaign that no other class can.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-23%20-%20Artificers%20and%20Constructs_files/savemygame_constructs1.jpg" align="right" border="0"><b>Solution 1: Building is What the Class is All about!</b></p>
<p align="left">Limiting the artificer's ability to make constructs is 
no solution to the problem. After all, building things is the entire 
point of the class. Artificers are mediocre at physical combat, their 
saves aren't great, and their infusion ability is pretty limited. If you
 take away or hinder their ability to build useful items (including 
constructs), you have just eliminated the one and only thing they are 
really good at. Doing so is like taking away a rogue's sneak attack 
ability or a barbarian's rage -- if not worse. If you're going to ruin 
the class, why bother allowing it in the campaign at all?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Commanding a Construct Effectively</b></p>
<p align="left">One way to gain the upper hand in construct control is 
to ensure that the system for commanding them stays realistic. On the 
downside, a construct is unintelligent, so it takes no initiative until 
its creator tells it what to do. However, it does not resist its 
creator's commands or have any chance of misunderstanding them. But 
exactly how much can a PC expect from a construct?</p>
<p align="left">If you want to clarify what a construct knows how to do,
 you could model its "programming" on the tricks defined in the Handle 
Animal skill description. If you wish, you could even set a limit on how
 many tricks a given type of construct could know. The amount of time it
 takes to issue commands to a construct should vary with the complexity 
of the order. A very simple command consisting of no more than a few 
words could be issued as a free action, but giving a more complex 
command should require a move action, just as handling an animal does. A
 full-round action might be required to relay a really complex order, 
but commanding your construct to hold someone's mouth closed isn't 
really that complicated.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Compare Crafting Constructs with Other Class Abilities</b></p>
<p align="left">The artificer can't create a construct until 6th level 
at the earliest because of the prerequisites for Craft Construct. So to 
decide whether the ability unbalances the game at that point, compare it
 with the mid-level abilities granted by other classes. Is crafting a 
construct really better than a paladin's ability to summon a special 
mount, or a druid's wild shape, or a barbarian's improved uncanny dodge?
 If you compare the constructs an artificer can make to a druid's animal
 companion, a paladin's mount, or even the familiar of a mid-level 
wizard, you'll see that the power levels compare pretty favorably -- 
especially since the latter creatures come essentially free. They take 
little if any time to acquire, are pretty easy to replace if killed 
(although replacing a familiar does involve a hefty XP penalty), and do 
not cost a feat slot (much less three, if you count Craft Construct's 
prerequisites).</p>
<p align="left">The big difference between the artificer's ability to 
create constructs and the comparable abilities of other classes is that 
the artificer isn't limited to just one construct -- he can 
theoretically build as many as he likes. But making constructs costs 
resources, and a PC artificer shouldn't have the means to make anything 
particularly troublesome -- especially when he first gains the ability. 
And even if he does, you have to weigh the value of the constructs 
against other items that could be made or bought with that money. Every 
gp and XP spent on creating constructs is one the character isn't 
spending on creating or buying magic items or other resources. So while 
the artificer may have a great construct to command, he may be quite 
vulnerable personally.</p>
<p align="left">The <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20040125a">official errata</a> for the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i>
 on the Wizards of the Coast website states that the superscript note on
 the Feats Table indicating that the Artisan feats can be taken multiple
 times was an error. These feats can still be used in conjunction to 
gain a 25% decrease in XP cost, gp cost, and creation time, but each 
feat can be taken only once. To let them stack would be pretty silly, 
since if an artificer took one of those feats four times (which he could
 do by 12th level), he could craft items of the chosen type (such as 
constructs) instantaneously or for free (in either XP or gold). Madness!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Constructive Complications</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-23%20-%20Artificers%20and%20Constructs_files/savemygame_constructs2.jpg" align="right" border="0">
 One way to simplify construct creation is to limit it strictly to the 
constructs detailed in the books. Lots of the min-maxing that can take 
place with item creation comes from characters creatively manipulating 
item values and slots to make the benefits fit just so. If you stipulate
 that item creation does not allow PCs to make custom items and 
constructs, then yes, you are stifling innovation and squelching player 
creativity, but you're also making life a lot easier on yourself. If 
that solution doesn't sit right with you, but you feel that you can't 
take the time to deal with integrating a nonstandard construct into the 
campaign, then just disallow it.</p>
<p align="left">This kind of situation is why some DMs avoid psionics. 
Because they don't have the time or inclination to study the fine points
 and mechanics of the system and adjust the rest of the campaign to 
compensate, they are at the mercy of a player who knows how to work the 
system and who -- since her psionic character is the one who benefits --
 has a vested interest in finding and exploiting every loophole. My own 
shameless exploitation of the psionics rules has driven two of my DMs to
 ban psionics from their campaigns in 3rd Edition alone!</p>
<p align="left">Obviously, calling for redesign or replacement of 
characters in the middle of a campaign can cause some problems, 
especially since it disproportionately affects one player. In fact, this
 tactic could be seen as penalizing someone for playing well or for 
investing time and effort in making full use of his character's 
abilities. For this reason, disallowing the use of whole systems in 
midstream is a less than optimal solution, but it can save your sanity 
in the short term.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">At first glance, the artificer's ability to create 
constructs might seem like a threat to game balance. But when compared 
with a paladin's special mount, a druid's animal companion (not to 
mention her ability to wild shape), or a mid-level wizard's familiar, 
the construct's power level doesn't look that much different. And 
coupled with the artificer's mediocre combat skills, saves, and magical 
ability, a talent for creating constructs doesn't seem so out of line. 
Furthermore, commanding a construct is not necessarily a free action, 
depending on the complexity of the instruction. However, allowing 
players too much free rein with this ability can create headaches for 
the DM, particularly when PCs start designing custom constructs that 
must be analyzed before approval. The best way to deal with this problem
 is to disallow constructs that aren't in the books. The artificer need 
not be a game-breaker; include one in your campaign and see how much 
excitement he can add!</p>
