<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Chopping Down the Adventure</h4>
<p><i>Whenever I confront my players with a locked or barred door that 
they can't make the Open Lock or Strength DCs for, they use a method 
which is beginning to tick me off. Instead of looking for a key or an 
alternate route, one character pulls out his adamantine weapon and hack 
his way through, sometimes taking six in-game hours to get through one 
door. I've tried everything that I can think of to stop them from doing 
this. I've tried trapping doors, pulling the "constitution check" rule, 
and increasing encounter chances. They simply demolished the traps the 
same way, took the Endurance feat, and killed the creatures. When I put 
iron doors in the dungeon, the characters hacked through ten feet of 
worked stone instead. Am I trying too hard to herd my PCs? Do you have 
any useful ideas?</i></p>
<p align="right"> -- Jamie, a slightly ticked-off DM in Redmond, WA, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>You asked two questions there. To the first one, yes, you probably 
are trying too hard to herd your PCs. You are getting irate that they 
will not go through the proper forms of picking locks, searching rooms, 
and exploring more of the dungeon to find the long way around. Still, 
you are part of the gaming group, too, and that means that your 
satisfaction is part of the bargain in determining whether the campaign 
is fun.</p>
<p>Before I make suggestions, though, make sure you think about things 
from your players' perspective. Why should they do the adventure your 
way? They have found a universal key that always goes through the 
shortest and most direct route. Yes, this makes the rogue-type 
characters in the party feel a little useless with their umpteen ranks 
of Open Lock and Disable Device that will never again see the light of 
day (3rd Edition <i>D&amp;D</i> is not nearly so bad about obsolescing rogue-types as were earlier editions; <i>Complete Scoundrel</i>,
 released this January, promises to help with such issues). 
Nevertheless, players tend to go with things that work, and this 
strategy works. I had a high-teens level 3.0 character with a <i>maul of the titans</i>,
 high Strength, and Power Attack, plus the ability to enlarge himself. 
Doors, walls, it didn't matter. He could bust right through stuff and, 
combining Power Attack and the triple-damage-vs.-objects power of the 
maul, he routinely did in excess of 100 points of damage to objects per 
attack. With four attacks per round, smashing through a 3-foot-thick 
stone wall (hardness 8, 540 hit points) was easy. I mostly used it to 
bash down doors -- rarely did it take more than one shot. It probably 
was highly aggravating for the DM, because as the rules were laid out, 
there seemed to be nothing she could do about it. Sometimes there were 
consequences, especially if opponents on the other side heard us coming 
and readied attacks.</p>
<p>Destroying a weapon or other item in the midst of combat is a 
challenge, because it requires you to sacrifice attacks that could 
otherwise be devoted to attacking creatures. It also may represent 
destroying potential treasure. The fact that it is an opposed roll means
 you can't just go max Power Attack to beat hardness -- if you reduce 
your attack roll, you might spoil the attack entirely.</p>
<p>Bashing down a door or wall has none of these limitations. You can 
stack your damage bonuses, and by far the biggest one is Power Attack. 
You almost cannot miss a stationary object, so a high-level fighter type
 can really go to town. It's there in the rules, and your players (and 
me, in one of my more min-maxing moments) found it, used it, and abused 
it.</p>
<p>My point is that, from this perspective, if you can chop your way 
through the dungeon, why would you even care about walls and doors? Your
 point is that this violates your sense of heroic gaming aesthetics by 
reducing PCs to miners and sappers behind an unstoppable drilling 
machine. You tried to stop it and used some good ideas. Invoking the 
Constitution check rule is excellent DMing, as is using wandering 
monsters and trapped doors. These are all sensible and logical, fair 
play as a DM, and thoughtful as well. But your players are sensible and 
logical too, and they know that for every measure, there is a 
counter-measure. If Constitution checks are a problem, take Endurance, 
just as you stated. If wandering monsters are attracted, hey, that just 
makes the PCs' job easier in a way, because now the "xp on the hoof" are
 coming to them instead of them having to find the monsters.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how it's possible for it to take six hours in-game to 
smash through a door, though, unless you are counting the time taken up 
with wandering monsters and dealing with them. Still, it brings up a 
problem with contrast in styles. Your players spent six hours dealing 
with the door their way, bashing and smashing and taking on all comers. I
 wonder how long it would have taken them to achieve the same thing 
(i.e., going through the door) using what I'll call "your way" -- 
searching for the key or special whatevers needed to pass through, using
 skills and such. Would it have involved several hours of adventuring to
 achieve the same thing? If so, is the problem that their method took 
more time than the one you would have preferred or that it just created 
an un-fun situation, at least for you.</p>
<p>So yes, you are trying to herd your players, because you want them to
 play the game your way rather than their way. In this case there is no 
simple, happy medium on which both sides can agree. It's OK to herd your
 players sometimes, and it's OK for them to stray sometimes. The problem
 here is that the situation seems to have gotten out of balance, and you
 have given them a tool that they are now using to beat you over the 
head. I've said many times that it's not a crime for PCs to be really 
good at something. If that one thing takes over the game, on the other 
hand, you have every right as the DM to try to rectify the situation to 
make it more fun and equitable for everyone.</p>
<p>Now you want to fix it, and you're doing good work, but you're going 
about it the wrong way. Your strategy has been to counter-design to 
compensate for the adamantine weapon or to impose in-game consequences 
for using the adamantine weapon. Your real goal probably should be to 
get rid of it. Some people may say this is a cop-out or lazy DMing, but 
you've already tried to play fair while the players have not. They are 
exploiting a rules loophole (the fact that the adamantine rule does not 
discriminate between types and sizes of items it chops through). Maybe 
it's time for you to fight dirty. Next time out, I'll show you how.</p>
