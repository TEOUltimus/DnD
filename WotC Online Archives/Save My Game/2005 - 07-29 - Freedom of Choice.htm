<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="LEFT"><b>Player Choice -- Is It Necessary?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> In this installment of <i>Save My Game,</i> we examine 
the issue of player choice. Players might resent being railroaded into 
undertaking the adventure the DM has prepared, but if left to 
themselves, they may be unable to find enough interesting adventures to 
occupy their time. What's a DM to do?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Problem: A Matter of Choice</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>I have been in games, both as a player and as a DM, 
in which the players want to pursue their own interests rather than 
following the storyline. Although they seem to have fun with such 
adventures, they later complain to the DM that the campaign has no story
 or is getting boring. And if the DM doesn't let them "do their own 
thing," they claim he is restricting them because he fears thinking on 
the fly. -- Adapted from a post made by Gavalicks on the D&amp;D boards 
on the Wizards of the Coast website</b><i></i></p>
<p align="LEFT">This problem is a very common one. Your players have two
 desires, both of which are perfectly reasonable. They want to have an 
interesting and important mission to fulfill, but they also want to feel
 that they can make their own decisions. You might have created a great 
and important adventure for your campaign, but if your players don't 
find it interesting, or don't think it would appeal to their characters,
 they're likely to resist getting involved with it. Still, if they don't
 have any better ideas about what they'd like to do, or if their goals 
are beyond the resources they have available at the moment, they're 
stuck with open-ended adventuring, which can become pretty dull over 
time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">I've been in similar situations. In one campaign I 
played, our characters were in a territory at war. We knew a fair bit 
about the setting and the world, and we had free rein to do whatever we 
liked in the city we were using as our base. But we had no way to figure
 out what was important in the campaign world, so we ended up bouncing 
around aimlessly into one unimportant dead-end after another. We could 
find activities to fill the days if we looked hard enough, but none of 
our adventures seemed to lead anywhere. As low-level PCs, we had neither
 the connections to get offers of important missions nor the money to 
undertake our own. Thus, we had very few options when it came to "doing 
our own thing," and though the campaign was very realistic, it was not 
terribly heroic or inspiring. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If your players' only option is to do their own thing, 
they can feel just as restricted as if the campaign had only one 
plotline from which they could not deviate.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 1: Give Them Freedom of Choice</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> When it's time for the party to undertake a new 
adventure, you need to have several options prepared. The range of 
choices doesn't have to be infinite; you just need enough to convince 
the players that they are in control of their characters' joint destiny.
 Try to give them at least two, preferably three, and as many as four or
 five different avenues for adventure. Some of these options can be tied
 together -- for example, if the characters investigate the Tower of 
Wasilla or check out the Slave Pits of Gurinder, they find clues leading
 to the Tomb of Millares Gavino and information about the Cult of 
Sembera's plot to revive its ancient high priest. The other choices can 
be unrelated one-time adventures, or they might lead in entirely 
different campaign directions. This latter option can really convince 
players that their choices matter, especially if the adventures not 
chosen do not wait for the characters' return. For instance, if the 
characters choose the Expedition to Mozeliak, they may come home to 
discover that the Cult of Sembera has already succeeded in its dire 
plot! </p>
<p align="LEFT">As long as you offer more than one option, the players 
are likely to feel as though the choice of adventure was theirs, not 
yours. But letting players have choices doesn't mean you have to 
improvise all the encounters as you go.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 2: Have an Encounter Ready, Just in Case</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Before beginning play, prepare a few small, ready-made 
encounters, NPCs, or locations that you can easily adapt to any place 
the PCs might want to go. Then when they go off in a direction you 
didn't expect or decide to abandon their planned adventure in the middle
 of a session, you can still give them an interesting encounter (see <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20050722a">Save My Game #9</a>
 on ad-libbing adventures). If you don't have the time or inclination to
 design some quick side-treks that you may not use for a while, look in <b>Dungeon</b> magazine, or find a large-scale published adventure such as <i>Ruins of Undermountain</i> (and the updated <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ru/20050309a">Return to Undermountain</a></i> rooms) or <i>Ruins of Myth Drannor.</i>
 Big adventures such as these have lots of interesting bits and pieces 
that can easily be broken off and dropped into a campaign whenever you 
need them. Just because all the encounters are in the same area doesn't 
mean you have to use them that way. Some such encounters are nice 
set-pieces that offer a bit of depth and can even be connected to larger
 events in your campaign.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Not every adventure in your campaign has to be related 
to the main plot or theme (if you have one). Your PCs might get tired of
 battling the <i>Temple of Elemental Evil</i> and want to take a short 
break from it. If they break off, but keep running into agents of the 
temple everywhere they go and having the same encounters they would have
 faced had they not left, they are likely to get annoyed. From the 
player's point of view, you're just picking up the adventure and 
sticking it back in front of them, so that they have to play your 
scenario, your way, no matter where they go. </p>
<p align="LEFT">It's perfectly fair to have agents of the temple hunt 
down PCs who have been attacking the place for a while, even if they 
decide to undertake some other mission. Making sure that PC actions have
 consequences is just good DMing -- after all, a campaign world with a 
life of its own is generally more exciting than a dungeon that just 
waits passively to be pillaged. But once the PCs leave the<i> Temple of Elemental Evil,</i> don't make Caves of the Fire Temple their next adventure. ("Honest, it has no connection to the fire temple in <i>Temple of Elemental Evil!</i>")</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 3: Give Them Room to Breathe</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Lastly, make sure you structure some time in the 
campaign for players to do whatever they like, including nothing at all.
 Heck, real people take vacations, so why shouldn't the PCs? If you 
like, you can just unilaterally declare some downtime for the party by 
saying, "Okay, you have fifteen days to rest and recuperate, party 
hearty, or whatever you like, and we'll pick up the story again on 
Patchwall the 20th." Such rulings rarely produce gripes and grumbles as 
long as you don't penalize the PCs for any time lag that you have 
imposed. So don't pick up the game by saying, "Oops, looks like the 
Lich-Lord Awasom had time to complete his zombie army while you were on 
the beach sipping mint juleps!"</p>
<p align="LEFT">Make sure the PCs have time to make magic items, 
research spells, and buy or build homes, businesses, or castles. 
Especially at high levels, they will need time to take care of personal 
business, so make it available. But realize that not all PCs need the 
same amount of time off -- the fighters may have to take a lot of 
vacations while the spellcasters are making magic items. So talk to the 
players whose characters have fewer time demands and see what they might
 like to do while their comrades are busy. Preparing separate adventures
 for them may not really be feasible or fair to the players whose 
characters are busy with off-board activities, so try to find some 
useful off-board activities for the other characters as well. </p>
<p align="LEFT">It's okay to have a campaign theme that involves a 
desperate time crunch, but make that situation clear to the players in 
advance so that they don't get frustrated because they never have time 
to do what they want to do. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Players have two desires that sometimes seem to 
conflict -- the desire to be involved in missions that are important in 
the context of the campaign world, and the desire to follow their own 
stars. The problem arises when they get bored because they can't find 
enough to do on their own.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To keep the players engaged and give them a sense of 
control, you need to provide them with options for different adventures 
they might undertake. One or more options may be tied together, and may 
lead to the same subsequent adventure, though the players need not know 
that in advance. In a dynamic campaign, the storylines not chosen may 
progress to their logical conclusions without the characters' 
involvement, thus letting the players know that their choices do make a 
difference.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Have a few easily adaptable encounters, locations, or 
NPCs prepared in advance in case the players choose a direction you 
didn't expect or abandon their current storyline. You can invent these 
yourself, or pick them up from magazines or larger published adventures.
 Some can even be woven into your campaign storyline if the players seem
 interested in continuing those plots.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Plan some downtime in your campaign to let the 
characters do as they wish. As they attain higher levels, their need for
 downtime to make magic items, research spells, or operate businesses 
within the campaign world may increase, so be sure they have enough time
 available. And make interesting downtime pursuits available to the 
characters who need less "vacation" than others, so that they remain 
engaged with the world as well.</p>
