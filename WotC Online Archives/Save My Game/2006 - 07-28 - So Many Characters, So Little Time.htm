<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem --</i> So Many Characters, So Little Time</h4>
<p><i>Me and my friends have a rather large problem when it comes to 
making characters. It's not that we can't think of one, it's that once 
we make it, we play it for 3 or 4 sessions, then come up with another 
character idea we want to play. My question to you is, do you have any 
tips on making characters with diversity and staying power?</i></p>
<p align="right"> -- Mitchell, AskWizards.com</p>
<p>You're asking two separate questions here -- how to make characters 
with diversity and how to make characters with staying power. In one 
sense, the first is the enemy of the second. Your hunger for diversity 
in your characters may be feeding their lack of staying power. By 
definition, no one character can do everything well, so in a continuing 
effort to try different things or achieve different combinations, you 
keep stirring the pot by introducing new characters. You need to decide 
if what you really want is diversity or staying power, because these can
 be opposing goals.</p>
<p><b>Every Day Is a New Adventure</b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2007-28%20-%20So%20Many%20Characters,%20So%20Little%20Time_files/sg_20060728a_tsojcanth.jpg" alt="The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth" title="The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth" align="right" border="0" height="208" width="300">For diversity, you might run your regular <i>D&amp;D</i> game as a series of one-shots. In the olden days of <i>D&amp;D</i>,
 most of the published adventures were derived from tournament 
adventures. There was no real sense of sequence. You could very well 
play <i>D&amp;D</i> that way. If your group honestly does not want to 
play a single cohort of characters through an extended campaign, the 
solution may be to abandon the entire ongoing campaign concept. Everyone
 may have more fun playing stand-alone adventures. When you finish an 
adventure, you set those characters aside and start a new adventure with
 new characters. There's nothing whatsoever wrong with playing <i>D&amp;D</i> this way.</p>
<p><b>Character Trees</b></p>
<p>Another approach to the same idea is the 'character tree' concept from the <i>AD&amp;D Dark Sun </i>setting.
 Each player has a cluster of characters, each of which knows the others
 in a vague or distant way (not necessarily friends or family -- in a 
more traditional campaign, they might all be members of the same 
adventurers' guild). Each player plays just one of those characters in 
an adventure. The others are inactive during that time -- resting, 
healing, working, practicing, researching, or having minor adventures of
 no importance. If you are in the mood to play a cleric at the start of 
an adventure (or if the DM insists the group will need a cleric along), 
then you play your cleric for that adventure. If you were in the mood 
for something else instead, then you played a different character. You 
could switch characters under certain conditions -- generally, if the 
group was in a safe location where you could rationally explain the 
other character's presence. No fair switching in the middle of a fight! 
But if you hit a nice little oasis, the half-giant could wander off 
shortly before the elf strolls in. Besides giving players more variety 
in their characters, this also provides a smooth mechanism for 
introducing backup characters when a primary character die, regardless 
of whether the slain character ever returns to play.</p>
<p>Bingo! You get diversity and flexibility while still retaining a 
sense of cohesion. You could play a one-shot adventure with one group of
 characters, a second adventure with a different group, and a third 
adventure with a mix of both groups. Not only do you get variety in your
 personal character but in the group composition, too. This is similar 
in some ways to the 'every adventure is a new campaign' idea mentioned 
above, except the old characters don't just disappear into never-land. 
They stay on call and can pop back up again repeatedly.</p>
<p>The character tree allows players to tailor the party to specific 
missions where one kind of character is more needed than another 
(certain missions, for example, might place more emphasis on fighters 
while others emphasize wizards). Players can replace characters from 
their trees when those characters becomes boring. Finally, the <i>Dark Sun</i>
 rules included a mechanism that allowed one of your lower-level 
characters to also gain a 'free' level when a higher-level character 
advanced. That way, one favored character didn't outstrip all the others
 and wind up being the only seeing play.</p>
<p><b>Limit the Number of Sourcebooks</b></p>
<p>One reason why people want to continually try new things is because 
new things are continually available to try. New books keep coming out 
with interesting options. It's natural to want to explore options that 
didn't exist before. One solution is to limit the number of books 
allowed in the campaign. Either the DM mandates or everyone agrees on 
the set of books that will be used in the campaign and that's it. No new
 books means fewer temptations to dabble and experiment. There are 
plenty of things a player can do within the scope of the core books 
themselves, and you may have fewer headaches if you aren't worrying 
about new lists of feats and spells, or entire magic systems, every 
month or two.</p>
<p>If something comes along that several people in the group (which may 
include you) find really interesting, you can discuss bringing it in, 
but that should be the exception rather than the rule. In general, the 
best time to introduce new options is when most or all of the players 
are creating new characters.</p>
<p><b>Rebuild vs. Replace</b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2007-28%20-%20So%20Many%20Characters,%20So%20Little%20Time_files/sg_20060728a_psion.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="265" width="200">To
 keep the same characters in the campaign but still allow variety in the
 form of new rules and new tastes, make some allowance in the campaign 
for people to change their characters midstream. The <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook </i>has the <i>psychic reformation </i>power that lets you change known feats, skills, and powers. You could presumably use a <i>wish </i>or <i>miracle </i>(or even a <i>limited wish </i>for minor changes) to achieve the same effect. <i>Player's Handbook II </i>has
 an entire section devoted to creating in-game rationales and methods 
for people to reshape parts of their characters, sometimes down to 
fundamental changes such as race and gender.</p>
<p>If you don't care about the in-game consistency of character changes,
 just give players the option to redo their characters, changing around 
classes and feats that don't seem to be working or that aren't as much 
fun as they seemed they would be. This shouldn't be a regular event, and
 any reshaping is subject to the DM's approval so that it keeps the 
tone, feel, and personality of the character intact. Avoid wholesale 
changes -- reshuffling the building blocks instead of using all new 
blocks entirely. Knowing that a character is not set in stone may 
incline players to work with the character a little more rather than 
just pitching it when their concept changes a bit.</p>
<p><b>Consider the Campaign Flow and the Way You Deal with Replacement Characters</b></p>
<p>Another reason why people replace their characters frequently may be 
because characters die easily and quickly in your campaign. In a 
high-lethality campaign, players often feel less attached to their 
characters because they have a strong sense that the characters won't 
last. Back in the 1980s, there was a comic book series called <i>Strike Force -- Morituri</i>.
 A central theme In this series was that characters could gain 
superpowers, but the process would kill them within a year. Every few 
issues, a character would be gone. Readers (and characters) knew that no
 character would last. Players in your game may have the same 
expectation.</p>
<p>Or they may feel that their characters are not really involved personally in the campaign story. They might be <i>interested </i>in
 it, but if their characters aren't really connected to it, then 
characters are basically ciphers -- any other hero would do just as 
well. Characters become placeholders in the campaign. Soap operas often 
treat settings and characters as constants but actors as 
interchangeable. The same character may be played by a succession of 
actors, and the show just keeps on rolling as if nothing changed. 
Viewers know it's a different person, but it ultimately doesn't matter 
because it's just a role.</p>
<p>Finally, replacing a character with a new character may make economic
 sense in the campaign. Bringing someone back from the dead costs 
resources -- money for components, travel time to reach a place where 
the spell can be cast for you (especially if you hate the level loss and
 look at coming back from the dead as "<i>true resurrection </i>or 
nothing"). Instead of getting your old character back with a lost level 
or with the party (or the character) out 25,000 gp for <i>true resurrection</i>,
 it's tempting to just bring in a new character. If you allow PCs to buy
 their own equipment up to the typical PC wealth value in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>,
 a new character may end up with better stuff than the character who 
died -- and stuff that is better optimized for the new character's 
particular strengths. I say all this to make clear that it may be to a 
player's advantage to bring in a new character versus bringing back an 
old one.</p>
