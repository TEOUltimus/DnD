<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> No Time to Play</h4><i><p>Problem: "I don't have time to game." Answer: "yes you do." There are two major ways to illustrate this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at what you are doing currently in your life. Now take out Job,
 kids, wife, exercise and home maintenance. How much time is left? You 
do some kind of leisure activities. If you want to you could game 
instead. Instead of TV one night you could game. The choice is now 
yours.</li>
<li>If you are doing no leisure activities (a prospect I do not believe 
btw), you need to make gaming a priority. If your girlfriend made you 
give up all your friends so you would be each other's only friend, that 
would be dysfunctional. A girlfriend making you abandon your hobbies is 
also dysfunctional. My coworker was taking his kids to tons of 
activities, and of course he and his wife were burning out. They were 
grouchy and miserable. So they took the time for themselves. He would do
 stuff in his workshop and his wife would visit with her relatives. The 
kids were happier doing the things they wanted. The kids were definitely
 happier with happy parents. And what is the point of life if you just 
make yourself miserable living it? If you are a gamer, you need to game.
 Make it a priority.</li>
</ol></i><p align="right">-- stembolt, from Wizards message boards</p>
<p><i>The problem is that gaming requires a set time that is dedicated 
every week. So, yeah, you can't have an accumulated time of 4 hours 
every week to do the game but it is either one here or there or 4 hours 
on different days of different weeks. Also, everyone can't get that same
 time on the same day in their schedules. That's the sword that goes 
through the dragon. If people are doing other leisure activities and can
 dedicate a time for gaming that another group meets at, that's one 
thing. However, not everyone fits that mold and making a blanket 
statement that all people should game or they're being lazy is a little 
off base.</i></p>
<p align="right">-- WizO_Cat from the Wizards message boards</p>
<p>The above posts were part of a long-running discussion on the Wizards
 message boards among multiple posters, the discussion spawned by 
earlier <i>Save My Game</i> columns about 'mature' gamers and the 
pressures on them that draw them away from the gaming table. The 
essential question at issue here is whether those pressures are real, 
legitimate, and important issues that trump our favorite hobby, or 
simply an excuse to account for what is essentially poor time 
management, misplaced priorities, or lack of insight into our own 
choices.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that both sides of the discussion are right.</p>
<p>Stembolt and those of like mind have it right, that we often don't 
realize how much time we really have because we are poor stewards of it,
 and because we therefore waste a great deal of the time we have, we end
 up feeling harried and rushed and develop the illusion that we have to 
cut things out to fit in the things we want to do -- a false choice, 
because the time is already there, if we but allocate our resources more
 wisely.</p>
<p>Also, just because gaming is a leisure activity and of a lower 
absolute priority than family or work commitments, we sell its value 
short and treat it as if it were of no value whatsoever. In fact, in the
 face of real demands and limits on our resources, it is all the more 
important to maintain time and activities which allow us to relax and 
decompress from the stress and demands of our more exigent 'real life' 
commitments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people have different demands and different value 
systems and priorities, and depending on how those priorities stack up, 
the 'gaming vs. something else' choice may come up more often, and more 
often in favor of 'something else'. Each thing you add to the 'something
 else' side of the ledger -- kids, spouse, church, extended family, 
friends, exercise, travel, job, school, and on down the list, including 
other forms of leisure -- creates one more competitor for your time with
 <i>D&amp;D</i> and one more chance for <i>D&amp;D</i> to get aced out by something else.</p>
<h4>Dragon-Slaying Swords</h4>
<p>What really makes competing interests a problem for <i>D&amp;D</i>, 
though, is what WizO_Cat calls "the sword that slays the dragon" -- the 
fact that it is not just your personal schedule that matters. If all 
that were necessary to keep your gaming life in order was that you keep 
your own schedule better organized and prioritized, finding time to game
 would be easy. In fact, I think this is one of the main reasons why 
MMORPGs have become so popular -- they provide the basic tropes of an 
RPG, but they operate on your time, at your convenience. Any time you 
have a little block of time (or even a larger block that you put 
together by organizing your schedule to set time aside), you can game. 
You don't have to worry about anyone else. Now you might team up with 
some other players, planning to be online at the same time so you can 
tackle a tough quest, but you can game on your time, on your terms.</p>
<p>Real-life, in-person <i>D&amp;D</i> isn't like that. It requires you 
and everyone else in your gaming group to perform the same level of 
assessment, prioritization, and reallocation of time/life resources and 
to coordinate that activity so that everyone is on the same page at the 
same time. Something that scrambles one or two people's schedules (a 
friend comes in from out of town, someone gets sick, had to work late, 
burned out and tired from a rough week at work, kids have a sleepover, 
celebrating Uncle Ted's birthday, big paper due next week, have to 
finish the flooring before company comes over tomorrow) can be enough to
 derail the game for everyone else. Then what do you do? You 
individually have arranged your schedule to game, but now there's no 
game.</p>
<p>The solution might be to find new friends who are more reliable. This is a point where the economic model of <i>D&amp;D</i> as an activity breaks down, because <i>D&amp;D</i> is not a discrete and interchangeable commodity. <i>D&amp;D</i>
 is a social activity with friends, a context for relationship, shared 
experience, and group storytelling. You can't just say, "Well, Friday 
7:00-11:00 is my <i>D&amp;D</i> time, but since my group isn't meeting, I'll go play <i>D&amp;D</i>
 somewhere else." You could go ahead and play with two people in a 
campaign designed for five (or however large your group is), but most 
players and DMs in my experience have a certain sense of quorum they 
like to meet before agreeing to game. We're all busy and have other 
things that need doing, and if we feel like the game will not be as fun 
with a skeleton crew, we'd rather bag it and come back next time with 
the full group (we hope).</p>
<h4>Got Life?</h4>
<p>Coming at the problem from another angle, it is not just your <i>D&amp;D</i>
 schedule but also your other life commitments that intrude, because 
many things cannot be flexibly scheduled. If you have choir rehearsal on
 Wednesday night, you can't just change the night because you would 
rather game. You can either game Wednesday or sing Wednesday, not both. 
If your wife prefers to go out for date nights on Fridays rather than 
Saturdays because, as choir director, she has to be at church extra 
early on Sundays, then Friday becomes a less desirable night for gaming 
than Saturday. You may still choose to game on Fridays because that's 
when your group traditionally meets, but you may need to find some 
common ground with her desires, such as canceling the game once a month 
to make sure you get some Friday date time.</p>
<p>Another reason to consider changing the day of the game depends on 
the flexibility of the other people in the group. If several of them 
already have a Saturday game, maybe they would rather change to Sunday 
-- but I have church and a regular slate of post-church activities on 
Sunday, so that doesn't work for me. I may be out of luck. I could 
change the game day unilaterally and tell those who couldn't make the 
change to beat it, or force them to choose between my game and someone 
else's, but either way there is a rupture -- it's not about one player's
 choices and schedule adjustments.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if there is no fit between the set elements of one 
player's schedule (assuming they are things that person is not willing 
to forgo in order to game) and the schedules of everyone else in the 
game, then the game is off for that player. In order of priorities, it 
is important to pursue a range of interests and find time to relax, but 
relaxation may have to come from other leisure interests besides <i>D&amp;D</i> if working out a <i>D&amp;D</i>
 solution is too problematic. It may be a temporary thing -- a really 
busy time at work or school or even with leisure (some people take three
 weeks off in March to watch the NCAA basketball tournament every 
weekend instead of gaming, or in May to catch every possible movie at 
the Seattle International Film Festival) -- so you wait it out and get 
back to gaming when you can.</p>
<p>A conflict might be permanent. If in communicating with your spouse 
or significant other you find your high-priority time commitments make 
other opportunities scarce, you may have to choose between your Seattle 
Mariners 20-game package and your weekly <i>D&amp;D</i> game. Splitting the difference might work -- go to the baseball game sometimes, the <i>D&amp;D</i> game other times -- or it might not. Getting to play <i>D&amp;D</i>
 only once a month might be at the point of 'why bother?' for you, and 
it can be a problem for the DM and other players. Your schedule might 
change to the point where you just can't make it work with the people 
you used to game with.</p>
<h4>Honest Priorities</h4>
<p>Think about how much you want to game, how long of a break you want 
to take, or whether you need to find a new group that can match your 
schedule. Heck, this is why many gaming parents teach their kids <i>D&amp;D</i>,
 so they can combine doing things with the kids with getting to play. 
But if your kids aren't interested (or if only one is and the others 
aren't), do you play with just the two of you? What do you do with the 
others in the meantime, and what do you do with them as a dedicated 
activity in the way that gaming with your one aspiring gamer is?</p>
<p>There are no easy answers and no simple methods for organizing your life. <i>D&amp;D</i>
 makes things more complicated because it is a social, team game. What 
you can do and when you can do it has to match up with a bunch of other 
people. It's also something we love to do. That's why we're reading an 
advice column on a <i>D&amp;D</i> website.</p>
<p>Don't confuse commitments with cop-outs or excuses with reasons. If you'd rather be doing something else than playing <i>D&amp;D</i>,
 go for it. But don't pack your hobbies in the attic without taking a 
good hard look at what you have, what you do, and what you want.</p>
