<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="LEFT"><b>Replacing a Dead Character</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In this installment of <i>Save My Game, </i>we examine 
the best ways of bringing new characters into an existing adventuring 
party. New characters may replace those who have died, or they may 
accompany new players. Occasionally, a player may even wish to start a 
new character simply because he's tired of the old one. But the in-game 
logic of letting a new character join the party mid-adventure can be 
thin at best. After all, the existing characters have no reason to trust
 someone they just met with their lives, missions, and treasure. But 
waiting until the characters are between adventures isn't normally an 
option because the players of the new characters don't care to wait 
around for a pause in the storyline. What's a DM to do?</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Problem: Introducing a New Character</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>When a character dies, how do you handle bringing a replacement character into the party?-Bart</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">As we discussed in the last installment of <i>Save My Game,</i>
 many characters who die while adventuring are restored to life by 
magical means. But when the player chooses to let a dead character lie, 
or resurrection is not an option, a replacement character must come into
 the party -- unless the player also leaves the group. New character 
introductions can also become necessary when a player tires of a 
particular PC and wants to try a new idea, or a new player joins the 
group, or for a number of other reasons. So how do you handle the 
introduction of the new character?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 1: On-the-Spot Replacement</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Suppose a character dies, heroically or otherwise, 
during an adventure. What does that player do for the rest of the game 
session? She could sit around hoping for resurrection, but that solution
 might not be possible. Her character might have been the only one in 
the party capable of raising the dead, or another character who could do
 so might also have died. Or perhaps her character was killed in a way 
that wasn't amenable to resurrection. Or maybe the character didn't die 
at all, but was removed from play for an indefinite period by some other
 means -- banished to another plane, possessed or dominated by an enemy,
 turned into a newt, or the like.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The player could just go home, make a new character 
during the week, and come back next time. Or she could stay and enjoy 
the atmosphere of the gaming table, though just watching can seem a 
little hollow when everyone else is playing. Or she could goof off with 
her Game Boy or laptop, or watch television. If you're a creative and 
trusting DM, you might even let her run some of the monsters that are 
fighting the PCs! But if you're pretty sure she'll be changing 
characters -- either by choice or by circumstance -- why not let her 
spend that time working up her new PC?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 2: If You Were a Tree, What Kind of Tree Would You Be?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Creating a new character in-session after a PC dies 
offers certain advantages. Since the dead character's player knows the 
kinds of challenges the party is facing, he can create a character well 
suited to the task at hand if desired. However, abilities that are 
helpful for this adventure might not be so useful next time around. So 
make sure he chooses a character that he will actually enjoy playing, 
then see how well it can be integrated with the party's needs.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The same principle applies when a player is just trying 
to create a new character who can fill some gaps in the party's current 
lineup. You can certainly suggest areas where the party is weak -- after
 all, it's no fun to constantly have to plan adventures around specific 
party weaknesses to avoid killing the whole group. Does the party often 
have problems dealing with traps? Encourage the player to create a 
rogue. Are the PCs poor at ranged combat? A ranger or a sorcerer 
tailored for ranged fighting could be just the ticket. Even so, however,
 the player has the right to choose what he wants to play, and if he 
doesn't create a character he can enjoy to the fullest, he won't be 
satisfied with your game in the long run.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 3: I Really Don't Have Time for This Right Now</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">It's tough for you as DM to help a player create a new 
character during play. Invariably, the player presents you with a whole 
litany of "Can I . . . ?" questions regarding equipment, magic items, 
spells, feats, prestige classes, and so forth just when you've reached 
the climactic encounter with the rest of the group. But even if you have
 to ask that player to wait, try to take advantage of any downtime the 
group has -- such as meal breaks -- to deal with these questions. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Alternatively, you could encourage each of your players 
to create a backup character outside the game session. That way, you can
 confer with the players at your leisure about the characters, give them
 all the consideration they deserve, and have replacement characters 
ready for action at any given time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The backup character solution is especially appropriate 
for games that have high body counts. In fact, the text of the highly 
lethal <i><b>AD&amp;D</b> Dark Sun</i> setting proposed that each player
 create an entire "tree" of backup characters and included a mechanic 
for advancing them along with the main PC. Players could then switch off
 among their characters as often as they wished between adventures. All 
the characters in the tree were assumed to know each other, though they 
were not necessarily friends or even close allies. The combined 
character trees of all the players formed a sort of aggregate team of 
PCs who all basically knew and trusted each other for adventuring, and 
could be mixed and matched as the players saw fit.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For a typical campaign, one backup PC per player is 
probably enough. You may want to rule that each backup character must be
 lower in level than the "main" PC, and that the player must assign it 
equipment and spells appropriate for its level, so that it can be ready 
to go at a moment's notice. The backup is not a cohort or hireling -- 
it's simply an alternate character. If you have very few players, you 
might consider letting a player run both her main PC and her backup 
simultaneously. Doing so, however, makes the backup more like a cohort 
than a ready-made replacement for her main character.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 4: Who Are You and How Did You Get Here?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">If a new or replacement character doesn't already know 
the other PCs, the introduction must be handled with care to maintain 
in-game logic. How does the new PC know about the other characters and 
what they are doing? Why should the party trust him (and vice versa)? 
How do they even meet? </p>
<p align="LEFT">You could just hand-wave the problem away and announce 
that the character is a new PC in the group. Don't ask, don't tell -- 
just move on with the game. But that solution represents the lazy way 
out and tends to be boring as well. Putting a little effort into it can 
really add depth and spice to the game.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The transition is easiest to handle if the party is in 
town or in the company of NPCs they already know. That way, a trusted 
NPC can make the introductions, and if necessary, she can even request 
that the new PC accompany the party -- as an emissary, as a bodyguard 
for one of the PCs, or just as a favor to her. </p>
<p align="LEFT">You can also invent a connection between the backstory 
of the new PC and that of an existing character. For example, they might
 have been apprentices under the same master or hailed from the same 
home town. Alternatively, they could worship the same deity or belong to
 the same group, such as the Harpers or the Knights of the Hart. 
Prepared backup characters can make this process easier, since they 
either already know the party, or have pregenerated backstories that can
 easily be connected with the party's activity.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Finally, you can always use the "rescued prisoner who 
becomes a new PC" trick, though especially mercenary PCs may try to take
 advantage of the "prisoner" by laying claim to some of his stuff! Or 
perhaps after observing the characters for a while, via either spying or
 scrying, the new PC has decided to join them because of a common 
interest he has identified. Alternatively, the new PC might have 
valuable information about the party's latest adventuring target -- how 
to get there, what lives there, legends and rumors about the site, and 
the like.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">New character introductions are necessary in a variety 
of situations. The most common of these are when a character dies and is
 not restored to life, or when a new player enters the game. Allowing a 
player to create a new or replacement character while a game session is 
in progress creates distractions for both the DM and the other players, 
though it may provide needed diversion for the player who has just lost a
 character. By the same token, it can allow the creation of a character 
with skills that are sorely needed at the time, though the player must 
be careful to ensure that the new character is one he will enjoy playing
 in the long term.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A more elegant solution is to require that each player 
prepare a backup character who can be ready to go at a moment's notice 
in case her "main" PC dies. Backup characters can be assumed to be 
acquainted with the party, though they need not be boon companions. 
Advancement of the backup character can be a problem, but some campaigns
 allow frequent switching between characters to ensure that the backups 
do not fall too far behind the main group.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Alternatively, you can allow an in-game introduction by a
 trusted NPC. Or the player can establish a connection between his new 
PC and the rest of the group via a background or interest shared with 
one of the existing PCs. A new PC can also enter the group as a rescued 
prisoner, a chance encounter, or a supplier of important information. 
Acceptance may come slowly for a PC introduced in such a manner, 
however, since the existing PCs have no special reason to trust this 
newcomer.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Overall, the best solution depends on the party and the 
new character. However, some advance planning on the part of the DM and 
players, plus a willingness to be creative and spontaneous, can help the
 transition go more smoothly.</p>
