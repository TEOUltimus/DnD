<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Not Enough Time</h4>
<p><i>I play with some of my friends every weekend, but when we actually
 get to sit down and play, there doesn't seem to be a lot of time. Some 
of the smallest modules can feel like they take forever. Is there a 
better way to manage game time?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Joshua, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>We dealt with a similar question recently but specifically in terms of the logistics of <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20070706">running a large group</a>.
 The suggestions there could be implemented on any scale. Mostly it has 
to do with having focus and discipline. I used to run a weekly game each
 Friday. In theory, the game was to run from 7 to 11, a nice four-hour 
block of time. The problem was, on Fridays, people would come from work 
and stop to get dinner on the way. Some people would arrive early and, 
seeing no one else had arrived yet, they'd run to the store. Eventually 
people dribbled in, some eating their take-out food. We'd spend time 
joking around about movies or TV or the news, and so on down the list of
 possible distractions. As a result, the game seldom started until 8 or 
later. By 10 or 10:30, people who had been working all week were getting
 tired, and the game would wind down. Out of a supposed four-hour game 
session, we ended up with only two hours of real game time. When you're 
running 3rd Edition rules, and especially at high levels, that means you
 can manage one, maybe two combats with some in-between stuff. As with 
your situation, any adventure took for-flippin'-ever to complete.</p>
<p>What was the problem? We were not focused on the game. Hey, it's only a game! Why should we take it so seriously? </p>
<p>Here's why -- because we should show courtesy toward other players. 
One player dropped out of the campaign because, time-wise, it wasn't 
worth it to him to commute from the other side of town for so little 
play. He liked his character, liked my DMing style, liked the campaign, 
and liked the other players, but the time issues ultimately outweighed 
all those positives. </p>
<p>I relate that story to illustrate the importance of managing the 
fundamentals. So often we focus on small-scale time-saving strategies to
 shave off a few minutes here and a few minutes there. Instead, your 
emphasis belongs on the area that will have the biggest impact. </p>
<p><b>For starters …</b></p>
<p>Establish a start time and stick to it. The game gets underway with 
whoever is present when it's time to start. Even if everyone is there 
but only some are ready to roll, launch with the players who are 
prepared. This creates an expectation of punctuality, and it applies to 
you as well as the players. When players realize that you are serious 
about starting on time, they should become serious about being ready on 
time. We all know people have habitual issues with lateness, and the 
occasional scheduling conflict is inevitable, but you still need to pick
 a start time and stick to it. Late arrivals need to catch up and 
integrate themselves into the action as they can. If you really want to 
enforce the point, award xp bonuses to people who are show up on time 
(or reduce xp for latecomers on a prorated basis -- if you miss 30 
minutes of a three-hour session, you get only five-sixths of the 
experience). </p>
<p><b>Time is the meat and drink of a good game</b></p>
<p>If your game session is an all-day affair -- a Saturday, for instance
 -- and you decide to have a lunch or dinner break in the middle of the 
game and then resume afterward, it's essential to set a time limit. If 
people are leaving the house and splitting up for food, they should get 
carry-out and bring it back. If the whole group feels like going for a 
sit-down dinner, that's fine, but if only one or two want that, they 
should curb the impulse in the interest of not holding up the game for 
everyone else. Another option is placing a group order at a restaurant 
that delivers -- delivery isn't limited to pizzerias anymore. If you 
plan ahead, you could make food, have people bring specific items or 
take turns bringing the whole meal, or cook something quick and easy 
during play -- frozen pizza or lasagna can be popped in the oven even 
while the game is going on and devoured when it's ready. Breaking for 
the meal is still a good idea, though, because it's tough to role-play 
with your mouth full. </p>
<p>Snacking during the game usually is not much of a problem, but I can 
state from experience that a little organization helps here, too. Have 
things available nearby but not actually on the gaming table. Even if 
you have a big space, you don't want people's view of the action (if 
you're using miniatures) blocked by bags of chips and bottles of pop. 
Keep the containers out of the way, but provide paper plates or napkins 
or cups so each player can take what they need from the snack area and 
have a small pile of it at hand. Aside from the benefit to the game, 
people will be less likely to over-indulge in snacks if they need to get
 up from their chairs and walk even three steps to reach the munchies. 
Consider the nature of the snacks, too. Anything that makes your fingers
 greasy will also make your miniatures and dice greasy. At the very 
least, provide plenty of napkins (and keep those within reach!) </p>
<p><b>When last we saw our heroes…</b></p>
<p>I cannot emphasize enough the usefulness of a campaign log, journal, 
or recap. What might be a time gap of mere minutes or moments for your 
characters may be a week (or even a month) between play sessions. We're 
all busy people with full lives, and some people play in more than one <i>D&amp;D</i>
 campaign at a time or run one and play in others. A lot of game time 
can be spent trying to remember what happened last time, who this NPC 
is, why we were in this dungeon again, whether we had three or four of 
those Six Magical Whatsits needed to complete the mission, and just 
where everyone was standing when the umber hulks burst through the 
floor. </p>
<p>Ideally, one of your players will volunteer to be a record keeper for
 the party. The job might just as easily fall to you as the DM. Whoever 
does it, start each session with a summary of what went before. This can
 be a recap of what happened last game session, or it can be an 
executive summary of where the party is in the campaign. Some serialized
 TV shows (e.g., <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>) begin with a 'previously 
on our show' segment that hits highlights from several earlier episodes 
that are relevant to the episode that's about to begin. This is really 
important if your adventure or campaign involves a complex plot or a big
 cast of characters. </p>
<p>The other advantage of doing this is that it provides a clear 
start-point for the session. Once the recap is read or passed out, the 
game is officially 'on' and it's time to focus. When people come in 
late, they can get the handout (or whatever) and read it themselves 
before joining play. In teaching, this is called a 'sponge activity' -- 
something relevant to the day's lesson that gives students a focus point
 to start the class and draw them into what they will be doing that day.
 </p>
<p>In the end, there are lots of little things you can do to save a few 
minutes here and a few minutes there, but nothing will have as big an 
impact as you creating an atmosphere where game time matters. Start on 
time. Break on time. Come back from break on time. Don't interrupt other
 people. Pay attention to what's happening so people don't need to recap
 things as you go along. As the DM, be ready and organized, and help 
keep your players on top of what is happening. A little prep work by you
 and your players can save hours of puzzled looks and wasted time later 
on.</p>
