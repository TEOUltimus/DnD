<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><i><b>Charmed</b></i><b> Attacks</b></p>
<p align="left">In this installment of <i>Save My Game, </i>we look at 
what happens when PCs are forced to attack one another via charm and 
dominate spells. Adjudicating the effects of such spells fairly can be a
 challenge, especially when the characters involved are not especially 
friendly. What's a DM to do?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Problem: Charms and Party Members</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>What would happen if an NPC cast <i>charm person</i> on a PC and then told her to attack a party member against whom she had a known grudge? What happens if a <i>dominated</i> character is ordered to attack an ally, and that ally is then <i>charmed</i> and instructed to defend himself? -- Carol</b></p>
<p align="left">Adjudicating charm and dominate spells that involve 
intraparty conflict can be quite a DMing challenge. And when a grudge 
already exists between certain party members, can an order to escalate 
that grudge into physical combat really be considered against the PC's 
will? Let's look at some of the specific cases noted in the questions 
above.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Knowing is Half the Battle</b></p>
<p align="left">Mental control becomes much more useful when you know 
something about the person you're controlling. If you have some idea how
 useful a particular character might be, you have a better idea of 
whether to bother to use a <i>charm person</i> on him at all. You know 
which questions to ask and which suggestions should sound the most 
reasonable to him. You also know what subjects to avoid and which 
languages to use. If you don't have prior knowledge of your subject, a <i>tongues</i> spell is almost a must for <i>charm monster, </i>though <i>dominate person</i> does not require a common language.</p>
<p align="left">In much the same way as an assassin must observe her 
prey before striking with a death attack, you gain an invaluable 
advantage by doing a bit of reconnaissance before casting your <i>charm person</i> spell. If you plan to use any form of mental control, <i>augury</i> or <i>divination</i>
 might provide clues about the best targets to control and how best to 
approach them. Skills such as Gather Information and Knowledge (local) 
can help you understand the local customs and traditions, as well as 
regional variations and proper forms of address and greeting, so that 
you can set up your interaction in the most favorable way. A simple 
spell such as <i>detect thoughts</i> can be a valuable tool for gaining 
specific information about your proposed subject, and a stronger 
information-gathering ability -- such as the psionic power <i>mind probe</i> -- is worth even more, since it can reveal an inter-character grudge that you might be able to exploit!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Make Your Own Luck</b></p>
<p align="left">Suppose you can't find a useful grudge or conflict to 
exploit, or maybe you don't have time to look. You might be able to 
achieve a similar result by taking matters into your own hands! Use <i>modify memory</i>
 to implant a false memory of a grudge, or of some offensive incident 
that would likely spark one. Alternatively, you could use an illusion 
spell or the psionic power <i>false sensory input</i> to show your 
subject a hateful incident and plant the seeds of conflict. Once you 
have a grudge established, the suggestion to attack an ally seems a bit 
more reasonable to your target.</p>
<p align="left">But what happens if both the attacker and the defender 
are mind-controlled? Even if attacking your friend does not seem like a 
reasonable suggestion, defending yourself against that friend's maniacal
 attacks certainly is. Using lethal force in such a situation may or may
 not seem reasonable, depending on the nature and effectiveness of your 
friend's attacks and how easily you can get him raised from the dead. 
But if your new best friend -- the one who has charmed you -- tells you 
that the friend who is attacking you is actually a <i>polymorphed</i> 
demon or doppelganger, that explanation might seem pretty believable. 
The believability of the story would be even further enhanced if your 
controller can show you some sort of evidence -- real or illusory -- or 
if the charmer has a good Bluff modifier.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Who's in Charge Here?</b></p>
<p align="left">What happens when you charm someone who's already under someone else's <i>charm</i><i>person</i> effect? Whose orders will the subject take?</p>
<p align="left">For starters, refer to Multiple Mental Control Effects on page 172 of the <i>Player's Handbook.</i>
 "If a creature is under the mental control of two or more creatures, it
 tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the
 control each effect allows." So according to the rules, both charms are
 in effect simultaneously -- and if the two sets of instructions don't 
conflict, the subject will obey both.</p>
<p align="left">More likely, though, you're talking about a tug-of-war 
between a bad-guy charmer and a fellow PC who is trying to counter the 
effect with a <i>charm person</i> spell of her own. So how do you as DM resolve the double charm? According to the <i>Player's Handbook,</i>
 "If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously,
 the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to 
determine which one the creature obeys." You could also give the ally a 
circumstance bonus on that Charisma check, since she has much greater 
knowledge of the subject and his motivations. Even though the subject 
considers both charmers to be his friends, a well-known friend can 
probably make a more compelling case for why he should do as she asks 
than someone who doesn't know him as well, especially if the PC charmer 
uses her knowledge of the subject and his personality (see Solution 1). 
Dueling with <i>charm person</i> spells in this manner is a risky proposition, but if you're out of <i>dispel magic </i>spells, it might just be a workable solution for you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Let the Players Play</b></p>
<p align="left">Mind control is a tricky proposition at best, and the 
fact that players tend to be sensitive about losing control of their 
characters makes the situation even more difficult. PCs are already 
complicated to run, and controlled PCs can be even more so. So save 
yourself some time and headaches and let the player play his <i>charmed</i>
 PC. Inform him that his character is controlled and instruct him to 
play accordingly, warning him that you as DM reserve the right to veto 
an action or take over the PC if he doesn't play the mind control 
honestly. Who knows? The player might enjoy playing a controlled PC and 
do so with relish and imagination, freeing you to run the rest of the 
game.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">When mind control spells precipitate intraparty combat, 
adjudicating them becomes still more complicated. Knowledge of the 
subject, whether obtained through long association or via divination 
effects, enhances the probability that suggestions will seem reasonable.
 When two casters try to charm the same person, he will try to obey both
 to the best of his ability. But when the orders conflict, the two 
charmers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine whose orders the
 subject will obey. As DM, you can apply a circumstance bonus to the 
Charisma check of a fellow PC to reflect her more fundamental knowledge 
of the subject's nature. Finally, allowing the player of a controlled PC
 to continue playing his character can keep him involved and interested,
 and free you to run the game.</p>
