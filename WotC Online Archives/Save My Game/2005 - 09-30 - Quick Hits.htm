<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>DMing Dilemmas</b></p>
<p align="left">This installment of <i>Save My Game</i> provides some 
quick answers to quick questions from the message boards on the Wizards 
of the Coast website. What's a DM to do if the players perennially 
expect to succeed without reading the rules, or figure that the DM's 
favorite will get all the perks? And what about players who want to 
carry the function of certain magic items beyond the realm of reason?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Playing Favorites</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>How do you handle players who expect you to play 
favorites? What about those who don't bother to read the rules but just 
expect you to let them do whatever they want? -- Adapted from a post by 
Kalriem on the D&amp;D message boards</b></p>
<p align="left">The favoritism issue used to be a big topic of 
discussion on rec.games.frp on Usenet. The most common complaint aired 
there was the DM who included his girlfriend (or relative, or best 
friend) in the gaming group. Whether it was true or not, the other 
players always assumed that the DM would go easy on the significant 
other's character in the game because of the out-of-game relationship. 
Really, however, this situation isn't so different from a coach of a 
sports team whose kid is one of the players. In either case, everyone 
assumes that some favoritism is likely to occur.</p>
<p align="left">The other issue -- players who don't read the rules but expect to succeed anyway -- can stem from many sources. The <b>D&amp;D</b>
 rules can be overwhelming at first, and no one should expect new 
players to be familiar with them all at the start. But experienced 
players should be able to make informed decisions, not just roll the 
dice.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: No Free Rides</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2009-30%20-%20Quick%20Hits_files/savemygame_freeride.jpg" align="right" border="0">The
 solution to both of these issues is simple: Let it be known that you 
offer no free rides. If your significant other has a character in your 
game, make it clear to everyone from the start that you won't play 
favorites. Say it out loud, and then follow through. You don't have to 
treat the supposed favorite worse than the other players just to prove 
the point; just be sure that you run an even-handed game and let the 
dice fall where they may -- even if your significant other is unhappy 
with the outcome.</p>
<p align="left">As for players who don't want to bother with the rules, 
you can cut them some slack if they're new. A brand-new player shouldn't
 be expected to know all the rules or conventions of RPGs -- in fact, 
it's easier to recruit new players if you reassure them that they don't 
have to know everything at once. But that situation should be temporary.
 If you and the other players are vigilant about showing the newbie the 
ropes, he should eventually learn how the game works and begin perusing 
the books.</p>
<p align="left">It's also fine to let players be creative and even 
cinematic with their characters' actions. If they say they want to do 
something that the rules don't quite seem to cover, listen to how they 
intend for the action to play out and interpret what needs to happen in 
terms of game mechanics for that idea to work. Then throw the dice and 
see if the PCs succeed. But <b>D&amp;D</b> is not a rules-light game, so players need to realize that characters always have some limits on what they can do.</p>
<p align="left">They key point in this situation is to emphasize to all your players is that <b>D&amp;D</b>
 is a team game, and anyone who wants to play must be willing to put 
some effort into it. After all, you have enough to do as DM without 
having to carry a player who won't play. To return to the sports 
analogy, a player who refuses to learn the rules of the game and come to
 practices, but still expects to play, is both delusional and selfish. 
If allowed to play, such a person is likely not only to hurt the team's 
performance, but also to create stress and division both within the team
 and between the team and the coach. In addition, by not knowing the 
ropes, the player is putting herself in a position where she can be 
hurt.</p>
<p align="left">In short, a player who is unable to understand the 
cooperative nature of RPGs probably needs to step back from the table 
for a while until she can learn how to play. Learning by doing is really
 the best way to become familiar with an RPG, but the player has to want
 to learn. After all, sitting at the table with dice in your hand 
doesn't make you a gamer any more than sitting in the garage makes you a
 car.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Constructs as Weapons?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Can a construct be sundered? It is a weapon in a 
sense, so the sundering rules should apply. And the steel predator deals
 more damage to magic metal items than other items, so does it deal 
extra damage to a construct? -- Adapted from a post by Pseudolife on the
 D&amp;D message boards</b></p>

<p align="left">This question really should have been addressed in the 
last installment when we talked about constructs in depth, but we'll 
cover it here instead.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Weapons are Weapons and Creatures are Creatures</b></p>
<p align="left">According to the rules, a construct is a type of 
creature. Thus, even though a combat-designed construct might 
philosophically be considered a "weapon" in the sense that it is created
 for fighting, it doesn't count as one in game-mechanical terms. 
Therefore, it cannot be sundered according to the sundering rules.</p><img src="2005%20-%2009-30%20-%20Quick%20Hits_files/48.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">As
 for the steel predator, you may want to reread its description 
carefully. Its sundering bite special ability deals extra damage on 
sunder attacks against any held item, not just metal objects or magic 
metal objects. Its magic sense ability lets it automatically detect 
magic metal, but technically it doesn't deal any more damage to metal 
objects than it does to anything else -- though it certainly likes the 
taste of magic metal better!</p>
<p align="left">If you wanted to play up that angle of the steel 
predator, however, you could make a slight adjustment to its sundering 
bite ability to let it deal double damage against any metal object, or 
when making sunder attacks against weapons, shields, or other held metal
 items. This mechanic retains the original ability of the steel predator
 to sunder weapons while also allowing it to chow down on metallic 
creatures and objects of all kinds -- including metallic (or mostly 
metallic) constructs, a <i>wall of iron</i> spell, or an animated object. All metal means all metal, regardless of its nature.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">The appearance of favoritism at the gaming table can 
cause bickering among the players and detract from the gaming experience
 for everyone. It isn't fair to exclude someone from a game just on the 
basis of an out-of-game relationship, but such situations do require 
extra care. In particular, a DM who has a significant other among the 
players must take care to treat that person's character the same as any 
other -- no better and no worse.</p>
<p align="left">While it's fine to carry newbie players along while they
 learn the rules, and even to let players contrive "cinematic" solutions
 to some problems, no DM should have to deal with players who don't want
 to learn how to play the game. After a certain point, it's perfectly 
fair to ask such players to put up or shut up -- that is, to remove 
themselves from the game until they have read enough of the rules to 
play their characters adequately. Finally, the sundering rules do not 
apply to constructs, since they are technically creatures rather than 
weapons. However, the steel predator's sundering bite ability could be 
adjusted to deal double damage against metal objects or in sunder 
attacks against metal items held or carried by creatures.</p>
