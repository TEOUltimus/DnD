<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Vow of Poverty, Part 1</h4>
<p><i>The Vow of Poverty is a great feat in terms of character 
development and roleplaying ops, but there are two difficulties we have 
encountered when dealing with it.</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i>What do you do in a "low magic" campaign? Do you just "reduce" 
the level to match the GP average? Where would that level 1 characters 
though? </i></li>
<li><i>The feat seems to be unbalanced when taken by Monk and Druid 
characters as they aren't giving that much up and gaining abilities that
 stack with their own. </i></li>
</ol>
<p align="right">-- Lukas, from Ask Wizards</p>
<p>Ah, Vow of Poverty. It's a fun rule, but fraught with all sorts of 
problems, some of which you allude to above. On its face, though, Vow of
 Poverty raises philosophical questions about how it fits in the game. 
Doesn't it violate the entire standard operating procedure of <b>D&amp;D</b>?
 Isn't that what adventuring is all about -- kill/loot/buy more stuff so
 you can kill/loot/buy better next time? For that matter, a Vow of 
Poverty character could ironically become the most money-focused 
character in the party, because they need to ensure that their cut of 
the loot pie is maximized in the interest of making sure that charitable
 needs are met (see "Other Ramifications of Poverty" on pp. 30-31). 
Sorry, Mumtaz the Mighty, but you can't take a larger treasure split so 
you can afford that nifty <i>+5 full plate</i> -- starving widows and orphans take precedence over you! </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2006-09%20-%20Vow%20of%20Poverty,%20Part%201_files/sg_20060609a_vop.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="270" width="300">By
 this I don't mean a character having a motivation for adventuring that 
is not purely mercenary, or even that the Vow of Poverty mindset is not 
admirable and noble. The poverty-charity idea is reasonable. In fact, it
 is probably more reasonable than the standard adventuring model for a 
character such as a paladin or monk and maybe even a druid, barbarian, 
ranger, or some kinds of clerics who eschew material rewards. Either 
they are deeply invested in helping people and don't want rewards, or 
they have taken spiritual oaths, or they're afraid all that junk will 
weigh them down or is a symbol of the decadence and corruption that they
 want to escape from, or they just like natural things and to follow a 
custom and habit that doesn't involve a lot of bling-bling.</p>
<p>But the <b>D&amp;D</b> system kind of forces you to have treasure. In
 order to advance up the 'challenge ladder', you need certain 
countermeasures for the foes you will soon fight (better armor and 
weapons, greater versatility in movement and other capabilities). A 
high-level character without high-level gear can still wreak havoc on 
low-power opponents, but is severely handicapped against more 
high-powered monsters.</p>
<p>Maybe that's as it should be. It depends on the flavor of your 
campaign. But that's the rules problem that Vow of Poverty aims to 
rectify -- a way for PCs who want to role-play the ascetic lifestyle. 
What you present are two clear concerns of how to implement it so that 
it doesn't make it an obviously superior option to just playing the 
regular way.</p>
<h4>Vow of Poverty in a Low-Treasure Campaign</h4>
<p>Presumably, the Vow of Poverty benefits are stacked up to create a 
character of comparable wealth (in terms of the equipment she could 
afford) to a character with typical piles of loot. Given that, if you 
are handing out less treasure than the average amount, the effective 
value of Vow of Poverty benefits goes up. If you want to keep it 
balanced with a lower level of stuff in your campaign, you need to tone 
down the benefits.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Altering the relative value of the benefits is difficult, because 
it's hard to put values on some of those benefits. Some of the exalted 
feats are great. Others are good but not great. Some are wimpy. The 
value is thus highly variable. Most of the specific benefits are easy 
enough to tie to magic items -- exalted AC bonus to <i>bracers of armor </i>(though
 maybe it should be more, because it stacks with everything you might 
add with spells), exalted strike to a magic weapon, regeneration to a <i>ring of regeneration</i>, etc.</p>
<p>But what do you do when the exalted bonus to AC goes above +5 (the 
standard maximum for most kinds of AC bonuses) or above +8 (the maximum 
for bracers of armor)? Do you recost the ability as an epic power?</p>
<p>Also, what price do you put on versatility and customization? With 
Vow of Poverty, there is none. You can choose a character for which the 
existing benefits are a good fit (see the next question), but what if 
you need to fly and you're not a spellcaster, or you need to fight 
creatures with DR other than magic or good?</p>
<p>Versatility aside, you also cannot specialize your equipment to 
tailor it around your character's strengths. Thus, even if the gross 
value of your benefits is the same as a character with equipment, the 
real value may be less since you cannot 'target' what you spend to 
maximize your advantages. You just have to take what you get.</p>
<p>One solution is to audit character wealth in the campaign -- know 
what everyone has so you can judge how much treasure is out there. You 
may think you're being stingy on the loot, but are you really? Then 
compare the average wealth level to the standard in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>.
 I used this method in my campaign (with a Vow of Poverty character) and
 found that I was giving out about 20% less than the presumptive 
average. To compensate, I cut down the Vow of Poverty benefits by 20% as
 well. This is hard to do for each ability individually, so I simply 
slowed down the rate progression of acquiring new abilities on table 2-3
 in the <i>Book of Exalted Deeds </i>(p. 31), rather like a prestige 
class that gets only partial spell advancement. This meant that every 
five levels, the Vow of Poverty character would 'skip' a level and get 
no special benefits. If you gave out only half as much treasure as 
normal, you would give out only half the Vow of Poverty benefits; the 
character would skip benefits every other level.</p>
<p>I did this well into the campaign (the Vow of Poverty character 
replaced another PC who had retired after being killed and brought back 
for about the seventh time), so I didn't have to deal with the 1st level
 issue. If you were to remove the first level of every five I can see a 
problem, because then a 1st level character with Vow of Poverty would be
 severely nerfed. I suggest cutting out either the last level of every 
five (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th) or the middle level of every five (3rd, 
8th, 13th, 18th). If it were every other level being skipped, skip every
 even-numbered level. Either way, you start to get your benefits at 1st 
level.</p>
<p>Remember that only humans can take Vow of Poverty at 1st level, 
because you must take Sacred Vow as a prerequisite. Even though it is 
not indicated on table 2-3, you do get a bonus exalted feat at 1st level
 (see Bonus Exalted Feats on p. 30). Your 1st level Vow of Poverty 
character will be viable but hardly overpowered. Their AC bonus is 
comparable to a chain shirt, and they can't select more optimal feats or
 prerequisite basic feats they need for other things. Instead of those 
two feats, they could have Combat Expertise and Improved Trip, or Power 
Attack and Cleave, or Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus, or Spell 
Focus (conjuration) and Augment Summoning. Your 1st level character will
 fit in just fine.</p>
<p>Next time, we'll finish up talking about how Vow of Poverty (and 
certain other game situations) may unequally impact different character 
classes.</p>
