<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>A Bit of This and a Bit of That</b></p>
<p align="left">In this installment of <i>Save My Game,</i> we shift gears from the usual format to provide some quick answers to quick questions from the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 message boards on the Wizards of the Coast website. These questions 
involve how to shift the composition of a PC party, and how to manage 
the use of the co-called social skills within the game. What's a DM to 
do?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Problem: The Same Old Mix</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>I'd like some advice on how to get my players to try 
out some different kinds of characters. All the new PCs they create 
always turn out to be the same old races and classes they always run. --
 Adapted from a post made by Drdec on the D&amp;D boards on the Wizards 
of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="left">A lot of DMs would prefer a different character mix, if 
only for a bit of variety. But that decision isn't yours to make when 
you're running the game. Whether the DM should even have a say in this 
aspect of the game is highly debatable, but let's look at some ways to 
address the issue.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Learn to Live with It</b></p>
<p align="left">Your players come to play, and they have a right to 
choose their own characters. Sure, you can help those who are undecided,
 but as DM, you're in no position to dictate their choices. The players 
are not your puppets, and their characters are not prewritten heroes in 
your story. The whole essence of the <b>D&amp;D</b> game is cooperative 
storytelling, and everybody should have input in creating the tale. 
Thus, if one of your players likes to play greataxe-wielding half-orc 
barbarians, you may just have to deal with it.</p>
<p align="left">If you do want to offer a few suggestions to your 
players, keep their best interests at heart. Look at the rules before 
you press too hard for an unusual class/race combo, such as a halfling 
barbarian, an elf cleric, or a half-orc sorcerer. Maybe such characters 
sound interesting to you, but think about why you don't see them too 
often. It's not because they're not interesting; it's because they're 
not as good as other character types from a rules standpoint. Players 
usually repeat the obvious combinations because they are demonstrably 
better than the alternatives. Are standard characters more fun? More 
interesting? The answers depend entirely on the player. You can always 
suggest combos that might be fun to try or characters whose abilities 
would fill gaps in the party, but trying to compel a player to run a 
suboptimal combination is asking him to play with one hand tied behind 
his back.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Party Composition Rules</b></p>
<p align="left">Even though you can't -- and shouldn't -- dictate 
character choices, instituting a few restrictions on the composition of 
the party is fair, as long as you talk to your players about it first. 
For example, you could rule that a replacement character can't have the 
same race and primary class -- or even the same alignment -- as the 
original. You might also limit the availability of unusual races or 
prestige classes. If the party is not in the part of the campaign world 
where such characters originate, they are unavailable unless the player 
can provide a very compelling reason otherwise.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Adjust Desirability</b></p>
<p align="left">If you would really like to see certain races or classes
 represented in the party, try asking the players why no one has chosen 
them. If the reasons have to do with game mechanics, consider 
instituting some house rules to make them more appealing. You could also
 add some extra racial feats, weapons, equipment, or prestige class 
options -- either of your own design or from published supplements -- 
that make unusual combinations more interesting in some way. Sure 
half-orc sorcerers have poor Charisma scores, but in your campaign, 
perhaps they radiate an aura of fear and gain bonuses when casting 
conjuration spells. You can use your own creativity to generate such 
perks, or talk with your players about ideas they might have to make the
 characters in question more appealing.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Problem: Dealing with High Social Skill Modifiers</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>How about saving my game by telling me how to deal 
with high Bluff/Intimidate/Diplomacy modifiers? -- Adapted from a post 
made by Tolby on the D&amp;D boards on the Wizards of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="left">Is it a problem for a PC to be really good at some 
particular function? If a player wants to dump lots of skill points, 
statistics modifiers, skill-boosting magic, or feat slots into bumping 
up a skill, by all means let him do it. He's paying the price for 
specializing, so let his character be a specialist -- and don't try to 
render that specialization useless. Come on, you wouldn't penalize a 
fighter for having a high Strength score, or a rogue for having 
exceptional Hide and Move Silently modifiers, would you? Then why pick 
on the Charisma skills? Many people still consider Charisma the 
"weakest" ability score, but at least <b>D&amp;D</b> v.3.5 offers some real game mechanics benefits for having a good Charisma score and specializing in the attendant skills.</p>
<p align="left">Still, such skills can be misused, so let's look at some solutions to that problem.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Enforce the Limits</b></p>
<p align="left">The game places limits on the Charisma-based skills, so 
be sure you're enforcing them. Most of these skills are 
language-dependent, so creatures with low Intelligence scores basically 
ignore characters' attempts to use them -- except Handle Animal. 
Charisma-based skills also require time to use -- enough time to hold a 
conversation or engage in some kind of meaningful interaction. A 
receptive attitude (that is, at least some willingness to listen) and 
relative freedom from distractions are also required. </p>
<p align="left">The circumstances in which a PC tries to use Bluff, 
Diplomacy, or Intimidate can also modify the check, taking into account 
race, alignment, obvious wealth, strength of numbers, the location where
 the encounter takes place, knowledge of local customs and forms of 
address, and so forth. As DM, you can also apply circumstance modifiers 
based on how much effort the player puts forth. The player doesn't have 
to be as dashing and impressive as his high-Charisma PC, but he should 
at least make an attempt to roleplay the negotiations. </p>
<p align="left">That last point is the crux of the situation. <b>D&amp;D</b>
 is a roleplaying game, and in a role-playing situation, characters need
 to use words and force of personality to resolve disputes rather than 
strong sword arms. As DM, you shouldn't be trying to undermine the 
opportunities and incentives for players to use those methods. If 
anything, you should encourage roleplaying and make a point of creating 
situations in which PCs can use their social skills. And make it a point
 to reward them with XP for overcoming encounters via wits and 
negotiation, just as you would if they had fought their way through the 
opposition.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Prepare</b></p>
<p align="left">If it's clear that at least some of your players want to
 use their social skills whenever possible, prepare for it in advance. 
Look at your planned encounters and try to decide which ones can be 
resolved through talking, then set the DCs for the various possible 
results using Charisma-based skills. Don't just use the defaults in the <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 -- really examine each situation. How tough is it to bluff these fire 
giant guards? What specific information is needed to get past them? What
 issues are non-negotiable for these NPCs? Are they under orders to bar 
passage unless visitors give the correct password or show the special 
token, no matter what their story? How big a bonus will you give for 
bribery, and does it matter what kind of bribe is offered? Should the 
adjustment be +1 for money, +2 for wine, and -5 for wenching because the
 guards have taken a vow of celibacy? </p>
<p align="left">Think about how difficult you want the task to be and 
set the DC accordingly. You can take the PCs' bonuses into account to 
some degree, but it's not fair to keep ramping up the DCs as the 
characters' bonuses improve -- they deserve some benefit for getting 
better. On the other hand, you don't need to make the monster a pushover
 or an auto-success for them, either.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">A lot of players choose to play the same old PC types 
over and over again. But party composition is one aspect of the game 
that is -- and should remain -- fully in the hands of the players. They,
 after all, are the ones who must nurse and develop these characters 
over the course of the campaign, and they have the right to play what 
they like. As DM, you can rule that a replacement character can't be the
 same race and class as the original, or that certain unusual character 
types aren't available in a given location. If players don't like 
certain combinations because they're clearly suboptimal, try tweaking 
them to provide extra incentive. And you can always suggest character 
options to cover certain gaps in party resources. Ultimately, however, 
you must live with whatever choices your players make.</p>
<p align="left">When characters in your party want to use their high 
social skill modifiers to talk their way out of situations, don't 
despair. A player who wants to put lots of resources into building up 
her character's social skills is free to do so and should not be 
penalized for making that choice. Offer plenty of opportunities for 
resolving encounters through talking rather than fighting. However, you 
can (and should) still make such situations challenging. So enforce all 
the rules that apply, including time, NPC attitude, circumstances, and 
language-dependence. Also, prepare for such situations in advance by 
using careful consideration when you set the DCs for checks with the 
social skills.</p>
