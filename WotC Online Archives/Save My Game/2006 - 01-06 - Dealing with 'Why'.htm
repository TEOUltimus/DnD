<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas

Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>"Why, Why, Why?"</b></p>
<p align="left">What's a DM to do when the players are always asking why
 the rules work the way they do? Are they genuinely interested in rules 
design, or are they just looking for a loophole that will give their 
characters an advantage? This installment of <i>Save My Game</i> examines ways to address such questions from both a rules balance and a campaign flavor perspective. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Players Who Question the Rules</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>I have a hard time telling players why the rules work
 the way they do without sacrificing either rules balance of the

<p align="left">A player who constantly questions elements of the game 
can be as tiresome as a two-year-old who has launched into an endless 
string of "whys." Why is chain mail better than scale mail? Why can't a 
character make herself invisible with <i>silent image</i>? Why does 
armor make a character harder to hit instead of absorbing damage? Why 
does healing have to come only from divine magic and not arcane? Why do 
the enhancement bonuses on armor and shields stack but those on bows and
 arrows don't? Why is the spell level of a given spell usually different
 from the class level at which a spellcaster gets it?</p>
<p align="left">The way you respond to these kinds of rules design 
questions can vary a great deal, depending on the nature of the query 
and the circumstances. So let's look at the advantages and disadvantages
 of several different options.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Rules are Rules -- Suck It up!</b></p>
<p align="left">Sometimes the simplest answer is the best one. Whatever 
game element is at issue, just tell the player that it works the way the
 rules say, period. If necessary, remind the argumentative members of 
your group that they are all playing a game, and the name of that game 
is <b>D&amp;D</b><i>.</i> The <b>D&amp;D</b> game is not freeform 
roleplaying -- in fact, it is often rather rules-intensive. Magic, 
combat, and other rules elements work the way they work, and those who 
can deal with that fact are generally more successful as players in the 
long run.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Metagame Explanation</b></p>
<p align="left">Rather than answering the question within the game world
 context, you can frame your justification for why a given rule works 
the way it does in terms of rules design. However, your ability to 
explain the rationale for a given rule depends to a great extent on your
 knowledge of and experience with the game system. If you've played the 
game through more than one edition, you know that certain aspects of the
 rules have stayed the same for many years, and that those features help
 to define the game as <b>D&amp;D</b>. If the point at issue is one of 
those rules, you may not be able to explain the reasoning in any 
objective or consistent manner. Sometimes you have to just appeal to 
tradition and let it go at that.</p>
<p align="left"> If time and experience with the game have given you 
insights into certain game mechanics, you can try to explain the answer 
to a player's question in those terms. This tactic doesn't do much for 
the verisimilitude of your campaign, but it does give players a better 
understanding of game balance issues. For example, suppose a player 
wants to know why his character can't activate two wands at once. You 
can tell him that activating a wand is a standard action, so a character
 can do it only once per round. Activating two wands in a round would be
 like casting two spells in a round or getting two full attacks in a 
round. (Yes, I know, special rules allow a character to do both, but 
those are exceptions that prove the rule.). The point is that the 
designers didn't want spells from wands to be obviously better than 
spells cast the regular way, so wands must obey the same limits as 
regular spells -- except that using a wand does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Make an Analogy</b></p>
<p align="left">One good way to address a rules issue is to think about 
the way the rule works and come up with an explanation or analogy. For 
example, suppose a player asks you why a character can't make two wands 
with the same command word. You could give any number of in-world 
reasons -- perhaps because the deities of magic will it so, or because 
some oddity in the laws of magic prohibits it. In the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting,</i>
 each mage may choose a unique sigil, and Mystra, the goddess of magic, 
guards the sanctity of these designs. If two wizards accidentally come 
up with the same (or very similar) runes, only one works, and knowingly 
trying to copy someone else's sigil can earn the perpetrator a divine 
curse. A similar reasoning could apply to item command words.</p>
<p align="left">Or perhaps a wand's command word is like a username on 
the internet. By that reasoning, two wand users trying to access the 
same magical power source via the same command word would be like two 
people trying to sign onto the internet with the same username. On most 
ISPs, if someone else has already taken a particular combination of 
letters and numbers as a username, the next person who wants it must 
settle for a different one (jasonnb37 instead of jasonnb, for example).</p>
<p align="left">If you want to offer a more in-depth explanation, you 
could point out that since wands are spell trigger items, pronouncing 
the magic words is akin to channeling the magical energy required to 
cast the spell in the first place. A wand spell isn't a 
not-quite-complete spell, such as a character might find on a scroll, 
and the energy to power it comes from the wand, but the user must 
connect with the item via the command word to make the magic work. </p>
<p align="left">Think of a wand as a flashlight. The wand contains the 
batteries (the energy to trigger the spell) and the light bulb (to 
produce the effect), but the user must flip the switch to connect the 
two. The difference is that not just anybody can do so. Only someone 
with the right training and the ability to handle magic of the 
appropriate type can "conduct" this magical energy. Having a fighter say
 the command word is like trying to run a current along a rubber band --
 it just won't happen. But a spellcaster with the relevant spell on her 
list can easily make the magic flow. </p>
<p align="left">Or perhaps a character can be a conduit for only one 
spell-trigger item at a time because the "circuit" is busy when the 
character is already using a wand. By this reasoning, a unique command 
word is irrelevant, since two wands can't use the same circuit 
simultaneously anyway.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Maybe the Player Has a Point</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-06%20-%20Dealing%20with%20%27Why%27_files/dx0106sg_savemygame_poly.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="258" width="260">A
 player who constantly questions the rules might do so to find an 
advantage or a loophole, or just to be argumentative, or for some other 
questionable reason. But more often than not, people ask questions 
simply because they wonder about the answers. A lot of the <b>D&amp;D </b>rules
 require some interpretation, such as alignment relative to actions. But
 some rules provoke questions because they are seemingly nonsensical. 
For example, a pick doesn't deal enough damage to break through the 
hardness of stone, so how can picks be used for mining? And why is water
 pressure damage so extreme that no creature could possibly survive 
below 100 feet of water?</p>
<p align="left">Players may be honestly confused about how the rules 
work in your campaign, and where your house rules may deviate from or 
expand upon the rules as written, so do your best to explain. And your 
players may also spot a rule that just doesn't add up. For example, the <i>alter self</i>
 spell description stipulates that the caster's hit points don't change 
when she changes shape. Her ability scores stay the same, but her Hit 
Die size could change if she turns from a human sorcerer with d4s into a
 lizardfolk or bugbear with a humanoid's d8s. Nevertheless, her hit 
points don't change. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Polymorph</i> works like <i>alter self,</i> except 
that the subject's physical ability scores do change, and the Hit Die 
size of his new form could change all over the map, from fey d6s to 
dragon d12s. But nowhere does it contradict the <i>alter self</i> 
stipulation that hit points don't change. It seems a little strange that
 a character's hit points would remain constant whether he turns into a 
house cat or a dire bear, but that's the literal interpretation of the 
rule.</p>
<p align="left">Your players might well ask why the rule was set up that
 way, or even whether it works that way in your campaign. 
Game-mechanical reasons for it to work that way abound -- to avoid 
making <i>polymorph</i> (or wild shape) too powerful relative to other 
similar-level spells or abilities, and so that shapechanging wizards or 
druids don't become better combat machines than the party's fighter. But
 why would a wizard <i>polymorphed</i> into a giant be so much weaker in terms of hit points than a regular giant? That concept doesn't make sense either.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Sometimes you have to think hard about the answers you 
want to give. "I can't really give you a good answer now; let me think 
on it," may be your best option in some cases. Game time is precious, so
 it may be best to put off a detailed discussion until after the game, 
maybe do it via email between sessions. But follow through when you say 
you'll think about it and take player input seriously. Don't get bogged 
down with arguments over minutiae, but give important issues the 
attention they deserve, then make your decision and keep those dice 
rolling.</p>
