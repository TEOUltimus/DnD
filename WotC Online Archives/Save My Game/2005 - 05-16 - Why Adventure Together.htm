<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game! </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>The Logic of an Adventuring Party</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The topic for this installment of <i>Save My Game</i> is
 why characters choose the adventuring life and the particular 
companions that make up their parties. In a group that focuses on 
roleplaying, the logic of the adventuring party can become a consuming 
issue, and new character introductions can bog down when players 
roleplay their characters' natural suspicions of someone new. What's a 
DM to do?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Why Trust These People?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>What can you do about the classic threefold problem 
that all roleplaying games seem to have: Why exactly should our 
characters get off their fat behinds and adventure? And why should they 
do it together? And how can existing PCs justify adventuring with a new 
character about whom they know next to nothing?</b> -- <b>Captain Casualty, from the D&amp;D boards on the Wizards of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This problem is a tough one. Most modern folks would 
never take up adventuring in the first place, and the few who might be 
willing to do so would probably retire at about 2nd level and count 
themselves lucky. Furthermore, anyone who made it to a reasonably high 
level would likely choose to retire, since he would probably have 
accumulated more wealth than he could spend in a lifetime. And why 
shouldn't he?</p>
<p align="LEFT">Logically, PCs ought to think the same way. After all, 
they're theoretically modeled on real people, or at least real people as
 they might be if certain elements of the fantasy setting existed. And 
if individual characters have to scrape for reasons to adventure, how 
much more difficult is it for a group to find reasons for adventuring 
together?</p>
<p align="LEFT">In fact, a PC could choose the adventuring life for any 
number of reasons. For example, he might want to get rich quick, or 
right a specific wrong, or rescue a loved one. Alignment plays a role in
 the decision to take up the adventuring mantle, but it doesn't tell the
 whole story of why your PC makes the life choices he does. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The characters in an adventuring party need not all 
share the same motivation for adventuring. One might be in it for the 
money, another for god and country, another to find a long-lost friend, 
and a fourth to gain revenge against a certain foe. The individual 
characters' reasons don't have to be the same; they just have to be 
compatible -- at least on the surface.</p>
<p align="LEFT">New character introductions can be particularly 
difficult to justify within the logic of the game. Why should a group of
 savvy characters accept a person they've never seen before as a full 
member of their adventuring group? They've probably been tricked by 
monsters and evil NPCs more than once during their many adventures, so 
why should they simply accept a new companion at face value? It just 
doesn't make sense from a roleplaying standpoint, but not to do so can 
bog down the game and cause unnecessary bickering among the players.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Let's take a look at the logic of the adventuring party and examine several possible solutions for the problems presented above.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Holding out for a Hero</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Adventurers are the superheroes of the <b>D&amp;D </b>world,
 and it helps to look at them with that kind of mindset. Whatever their 
reasons may be, they forego the mundane lifestyles of their world's 
typical citizens and set off to adventure in lost realms, dangerous 
ruins, and monster-infested wilderness areas. Adventuring is what they 
do, and it defines who they are. </p>
<p align="LEFT">In both games and real life, a fundamental egotism 
accompanies the possession of power. A person with extraordinary 
Strength, magical ability, psionics, or any other rare capability 
eventually realizes that she can achieve results that "normal" people 
either can't or won't. Because she can accomplish great deeds, she comes
 to believe that she must do so. She may be driven by the realization 
that others with powers like hers might use them for evil ends if she 
doesn't stop them. Even if others can't or don't appreciate her actions,
 she sees the need for them and feels as though she is the only one who 
can or will do what is necessary. This sense of heroic destiny becomes a
 consuming part of such a character's identity, not something she can 
just lay aside. Not every PC is strictly a "good guy," but most PCs do 
occupy heroic (or antiheroic) roles in the cooperative story created at 
the gaming table.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: All for One and One for All</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Because <b>D&amp;D</b> adventures are rarely made for solo play, characters are generally expected to act in concert. In that respect, a party of <b>D&amp;D</b>
 characters is rather similar to a superhero team. Everybody has 
different skills and powers that support the group, and the individual 
members' strengths and weaknesses overlap in such a way that the team is
 well rounded and able to take on any challenge. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Part of a character's motivation for adventuring is just
 being part of the team. His teammate wants to undertake a particular 
mission, so he goes along to support her. Once a character is part of a 
team, he tends to do whatever the team does.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This concept becomes more difficult to justify at higher
 levels because as PCs gain power and responsibility, their loyalties 
become split between their own plans and the needs of the team. Should 
the wizard research his new spell or go kill the dragon with the gang? 
He has all the money he needs, so maybe he should sit this one out. 
Should the fighter run her barony or travel across the continent to the 
Dead God's Fane? Hmmm . . . she needs more money to repair her castle, 
so she chooses to strap on her armor and go adventuring! Sometimes the 
best solution when individual interests begin to supersede the 
importance of the team is simply to retire a character for whom the 
adventuring life just doesn't make sense anymore.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Put It in Writing</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">To encourage team play, consider creating "charters" for adventuring groups -- a concept introduced in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms </b>Campaign Setting. </i>A
 charter gives a little extra in-game weight to the team concept and 
forces players to think of the adventuring party as an entity in its own
 right. It's not just four people at the gaming table, it's the Scarlet 
Juggernaut of Elturel! </p>
<p align="LEFT">A charter can also help introduce new PCs to the group 
in a logical manner. Upon hearing of the group's mission and successes, 
newcomers can seek it out and petition to become members. In like 
manner, retired PCs remain part of the organization and may be called 
upon in emergencies.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: One Recommendation Is Enough</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Before beginning play, every gaming group should 
establish some ground rules about which classes and alignments are 
acceptable for the party and which ones are not. Doing so makes the 
introduction of new characters easier because although the other players
 may not know precisely what the newcomer is, they know what he is not.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When a player wants to introduce a new character to the 
party, try to establish a background connection between the newcomer and
 one of the existing characters. Perhaps they were apprentices to the 
same master, or grew up in the same village, or served in the same unit 
in the army. Such a connection allows the existing PC to vouch for the 
new one. That recommendation should suffice to ease the new member into 
the group unless someone has a serious objection.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 5: Don't Worry about It</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">You and your friends have come to the table to play <b>D&amp;D.</b>
 A certain level of in-game realism is important, but the game is really
 about high adventure, not bean-counting. We do enough of the latter in 
our real lives; doing it within the game setting simply dulls the gaming
 experience. Roleplaying a shopping trip to buy equipment may be 
realistic, in character, and even occasionally amusing, but after 
everyone spends 30 minutes watching one person haggle over armor, 
weapons, spell components, and a Ketite cerulean silk robe, players may 
begin to believe that in-depth roleplaying is overrated. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Finding reasons for PCs to pull together works much the 
same way. You and your players don't have to roleplay the background 
checks the party should routinely run on new members. Just assume that 
they occur and everything checks out. Presto, it's done, and the group 
can start adventuring. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Does this method constitute a cop-out? Sure. Is it perfect? No. But it works.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Rationalizing why a PC chooses to adventure in the first
 place and why she chooses the companions she does can be difficult at 
best. An individual character can take up the adventuring mantle for a 
variety of reasons, ranging from simple greed to a deep-seated desire to
 support his boon companions. A charter for the group provides an 
excellent way of establishing group identity. </p>
<p align="LEFT">New character introduction can also prove to be a 
stumbling block from a roleplaying standpoint. Why should experienced 
and savvy characters entrust their lives and fortunes to someone they 
have never seen before? Establishing a connection between the newcomer 
and an existing party member can ease this transition, or the group can 
agree to forego roleplaying the background checks that the PCs would 
logically want to make, assume that the new character checks out, and 
simply go on with the game.</p>
