<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Making Sense of Charm</b></p>
<p align="left">In this installment of <i>Save My Game, </i>we look at 
how to adjudicate charm and dominate spells. PCs enjoy having the power 
to turn enemies into friends, but they typically balk at being ordered 
to attack fellow party members when they become the targets of such 
spells. What's a DM to do?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Problem: What Can You Make a <i>Charmed</i> Character Do?</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>I'm confused about charm effects. According to the spell description for <i>charm person,</i>
 an affected character resists acting against his instincts. But what 
does this limitation really mean? At what point are characters acting 
against their will? -- Carol</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#999999" border="0" width="250"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#F2F2F2"><td>
<p align="left">For more advice, on what happens if someone charms a 
member of your own party, refer to Stephen Schubert's recent Tactics 
&amp; Tips column: <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20050704a">When Good Friends Go Bad</a>:</p>
<p align="left">It happens in nearly every campaign at some point. The 
strong warrior, who the rest of the party admires and respects for his 
ability to dish out the hurt on the PCs' monstrous enemies, who seems 
unstoppable due to his combat prowess, and whose sword could cleave the 
party wizard in one hit (and take out the bard with the backswing) -- 
this ultimate fighting machine hears the DM utter those most frightening
 of words: "Make a Will save."</p>
<p align="left">In many cases, the fighter becomes incapacitated for 
some indeterminate time. But in the worst cases, the mighty warrior 
turns around, focusing his bloodthirsty gaze on his fellow party 
members. Charm monster, suggestion, confusion, and dominate person can 
turn the tide of a battle in an instant, and the party must then use its
 resources to eliminate one of its own. The tips in this article address
 what you might do in these situations. </p>

<p align="left">Mind control spells can be very difficult to adjudicate. Compulsions in general are easy -- you cast <i>sleep,</i>
 and the bad guys go to sleep if they fail their saves, no questions 
asked! But charm-type spells are complicated because in theory you could
 make the target take almost any action you wish, thereby essentially 
duplicating the effects of almost any other mind-affecting spell. </p>
<p align="left">The caster of a charm<i></i>or control spell can vary 
the exact effect to match what the situation calls for. That very 
flexibility, however, makes the spell just as much a DM's nightmare as <i>polymorph,</i> because it requires evaluating a variety of different applications. </p>
<p align="left">So let's take a look at how far charm and dominate spells let the caster go in terms of making people act against their will.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: What's a Friend Worth?</b></p>
<p align="left">If you cast<i> charm person </i>and the target fails its
 Will save, it becomes your friend and must "perceive your words and 
actions in the most favorable way." But according to the NPC Attitude 
Table (<i>Players Handbook</i> page 72), a friendly character is willing
 to "chat, advise, offer limited help, and advocate." Fighting on your 
behalf is outside the realm of friendly -- only a helpful NPC (one step 
above friendly on the table) can be counted on for that kind of aid.</p>
<p align="left">So how can you make a character helpful once your <i>charm person</i>
 has rendered him friendly? You could use Diplomacy, which normally 
requires a full minute, though you can speed it up to a full-round 
action by taking a -10 penalty on the check. Having a helpful creature 
on hand can be quite advantageous. It might actually fight to protect 
you of its own volition, without any orders from you at all. Since it's 
acting on its own, however, it may not use the kind of tactics you would
 like.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: A Reasonable Request</b></p>
<p align="left">A <i>charm person</i> spell also lets the caster attempt
 an opposed Charisma check to convince the target creature to take some 
action that it ordinarily would not. But the spell description doesn't 
specify how long this process takes or what exactly it involves. Does 
the caster convince the target by talking (a free action), redirecting a
 spell effect (a move action), or taking some not-otherwise-specified 
action (a standard action)? In the absence of specific rules, it's up to
 you as DM to adjudicate such situations on a case-by-case basis. If you
 think talking would suffice in a particular instance, fine. If you feel
 that the creature takes more convincing, you might want to drop some 
hints to the player about what kinds of tactics might be effective.</p>
<p align="left">Before you can determine what the target would not 
ordinarily do, though, you need to decide what it would do. Should its 
alignment play a role in such a decision, especially when the favor 
requested involves breaking some rule or law? How about the creature's 
Intelligence score, or knowledge the subject might have about the 
caster? Does a <i>charm person</i> spell make the target's mind all 
fuzzy? That is, if the infamous Tesfaye the Dark -- who has a price on 
her head big enough to buy a kingdom -- casts <i>charm person</i> on a 
guard, does he then treat her just the same as he would a no-name 
character? Does he care about -- or even remember -- Tesfaye's 
reputation and the value of the reward on her head while the <i>charm person</i> is in effect?</p>
<p align="left">The spell description doesn't specify that the subject 
forgets what it knows, so he probably does remember who she is and what 
she's worth. And if he has any integrity at all, he probably wouldn't 
turn in his friend for money, any more than her boon companions would. 
However, if the guard is the sort who would turn in his own mother for a
 gold piece, then Tesfaye may still have cause to worry.</p>
<p align="left">More importantly, can the caster make a request seem more reasonable than it really is? The <i>charm person</i>
 spell description appears to give conflicting information about what 
the subject can be made to do. At one point, it says that the subject 
will not obey suicidal orders. Shortly thereafter, it says that you 
could conceivably convince a <i>charmed</i> fighter to "hold off an 
onrushing red dragon for just a few seconds." Not only is such a request
 suicidal in all likelihood, but it also requires that the subject be 
willing to take risks on your behalf -- a favor above and beyond what a 
friendly character would do, as noted above. Perhaps, however, you could
 use Bluff to convince your friendly subject of the importance (or at 
least the reasonableness) of your request.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Taking It up a Notch</b></p>
<p align="left">Even the more powerful <i>dominate person</i> spell is 
not without ambiguity. The spell description states that a creature 
"forced to take actions against its nature" gets a new save at a +2 
bonus, but it doesn't specify how often. Does it get one every round if 
the order would take more than 1 round to carry out? Hey, if it's 
against a character's nature to attack his friend on Round One, it's 
still against his nature on Round Two, right? Or if he fails the first 
save for a given order, does he keep following that instruction, and get
 another new save only when he has to switch to a different action 
that's against his nature? Though the spell description doesn't say, 
it's reasonable to assume that the new save applies only when the order 
to act against the creature's nature is first given. However, if you 
encounter a situation in which you as DM feel that more frequent saves 
would be appropriate, feel free to allow them, up to once per round if 
need be.</p>
<p align="left">But does making this new saving throw break the spell 
entirely, or simply allow the subject to resist performing the specified
 action? Though it's not spelled out precisely, the spell description 
does give the answer to this one. The saving throw entry says, "Will 
negates," so any saving throw the spell allows breaks the effect 
completely. Thus, though <i>dominate person</i> is a powerful spell, the
 caster must be judicious about what orders she gives, or the additional
 saving throws can easily lead to wasted spells.</p>
<p align="left">Though a caster can force the subject to take actions against its nature with a<i> dominate person</i>
 spell, "obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out." 
Therefore, you still couldn't order your newfound friend to hold back 
that onrushing red dragon unless he has some legitimate reason to 
believe the dragon wouldn't wipe the floor with his entrails.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Mind control spells are classic elements of fantasy, so 
they shouldn't be eliminated from the game, despite the difficulties of 
adjudicating their effects. You don't want to make them so weak that 
they're useless or so strong that they're overpowering, but striking a 
happy medium that is fair to the players at the table can be 
challenging.</p>
<p align="left">In the next installment, we'll take a look at another aspect of adjudicating mind control spells.</p>
