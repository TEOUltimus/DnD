<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Have Prestige Classes Become Too Common?</b></p>
<p align="left">What's a DM to do when the players give their PCs levels
 in one or more prestige classes as a matter of course? Shouldn't some 
limit exist on the prestige class levels a character can have, to keep 
those classes "special"? This installment of <i>Save My Game</i> examines ways to address the prestige class proliferation issue. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Should Prestige Classes be Readily Available?</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>At the beginning, prestige classes were created to 
introduce a few prestigious kinds of heroes -- often from prestigious 
organizations -- into <b>D&amp;D</b> v.3.5 campaigns. But when prestige 
classes began to proliferate, almost every character began to take a 
prestige class or two -- or even three or four. Furthermore, a lot of 
characters these days seem to have too many levels in prestige classes. 
Players don't think about whether to take a prestige class anymore -- 
they think about which one to take -- and they plan for it when they're 
first creating the characters! </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>Personally, I'd like to see prestige classes become 
-- well -- prestigious again. So I've been thinking of establishing a 
rule of thumb for how many prestige class levels per standard class 
level constitutes a reasonable balance in my campaign -- perhaps 10% 
prestige class to 90% standard class, or even 20%/80%. I don't want to 
be too restrictive, but I would like these classes to be special. -- </i><b>Adapted from a post by Emanon on the D&amp;D message boards at the Wizards of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="left">It's possible to read entirely too much into the term 
"prestige class." If these classes were just called secondary classes, 
this kind of concern might not come up at all. But calling them prestige
 classes causes some DMs to wonder if they ought to impose some 
restrictions -- and that's not truly necessary. In a sense, a prestige 
class is a character's core identity. His base classes then become a 
sort of prep school for what the character really wants to do -- and 
that's fine.</p>
<p align="left">However, if you don't care for that model, you can 
certainly put more emphasis on the base classes for your campaign. If 
you prefer that option, here are several points you might want to 
consider.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Keep It Simple</b></p>
<p align="left">In this model, prestige classes don't exist. They are 
optional anyway, so just don't use them in your campaign. Players can 
build a world of diversity with just the base classes, depending on 
their choices of skills, feats, spells, equipment, and so forth -- and 
multiclassing expands those options considerably. But game mechanics are
 only part of the process anyway. Most character customization is based 
on personality and style. So if the player develops his character's 
personality and a good backstory that explains why he took up 
adventuring, he can bring his desired character model to life with just a
 few thoughtful choices.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-20%20-%20Putting%20the%20Prestige%20Back%20in%20Prestige%20Classes_files/dx0120sg_savemygame_racial.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="185" width="236">If
 you want to customize your character without muddying the class 
picture, you can also foster diversity with other rules, such as 
character races and regions -- including regional feats, languages, and 
equipment. You might also think about bloodlines and racial levels, as 
described in <i>Unearthed Arcana.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Think about the Classes</b></p>
<p align="left">If you're thinking about establishing a restrictive 
ratio of prestige class levels to base class levels, you need to 
compress the benefits that a prestige class offers. You can't spread 
them out over five or ten levels because the characters will never be 
able to finish the class while adhering to a low percentage of prestige 
to base class levels. At the ratio suggested above, for example, a 
character might not be able to take more than one or two prestige class 
levels in her entire career.</p>
<p align="left">A compressed prestige class system is a perfectly 
acceptable solution, if that's what you want for your campaign. You 
could fold each available prestige class into one level, so that a 
character either has the class or not. If doing so results in too many 
abilities gained in only one class level, you could let the prestige 
class modify the character's existing class abilities rather than just 
add new class features. Perhaps taking a prestige class would let a 
character "trade in" standard class abilities for special abilities 
normally offered by the prestige class. Such a system might function the
 same as the process for a paladin who has turned to evil and become a 
blackguard.</p>
<p align="left">The system outlined above is ultimately much more 
complicated than letting prestige classes function as written. Any time a
 character's advancement depends on retroactively modifying what he's 
already done, you are asking for headaches -- especially if the 
character ever gets level-drained and has to sort out what stays and 
what goes!</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Go Ahead, Make Them Prestigious</b></p>
<p align="left">If you don't want to do away with prestige classes 
altogether or come up with new mechanics to handle them, you can make 
them more prestigious just by being more selective. One way to do that 
is to tie prestige classes to organizations that are important in your 
campaign world. Just because the new <i>Heroes of Gardening </i>hardbound
 came out doesn't mean you have to allow the Zakharan Violet Tender 
prestige class in your campaign. So get rid of the generic prestige 
classes, as well as all the organization-based prestige classes that 
aren't relevant. That way, you can focus on the prestige classes that 
you actually want to make available.</p>
<p align="left">Before a character can get into a prestige class, she 
must know that it exists. Everyone knows about the prestige class 
organizations that maintain a high profile in the campaign world, and 
most characters probably have a good idea how to go about joining their 
ranks. But information about other organizations might exist only as 
rumors, legends, or whispers in the night. Actually discovering the 
requirements for entry into such an organization may require extensive 
research, or a friendly contact, or some action on the character's part 
that draws the attention of the group. Some organizations may be so 
secret that characters can discover their existence only through good 
(or bad) luck. See the <i>Champions of Ruin</i> and <i>Champions of Valor</i> sourcebooks for some excellent examples of such groups and their associated prestige classes.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2001-20%20-%20Putting%20the%20Prestige%20Back%20in%20Prestige%20Classes_files/dx0120sg_savemygame_nightmask.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="263" width="195">Once
 the character knows that a particular group exists, she must prove 
herself worthy to join its ranks. Taking the proper skills and feats may
 satisfy the entry requirements, but you could also rule that anyone 
wishing to enter a prestige class must actually do something to prove 
her mettle. In this sort of model, the prerequisites for every prestige 
class include some sort of action or accomplishment. So you can simply 
say, "I don't care if you do have 10 ranks in Ride and the Endurance and
 Iron Will feats. If you haven't scaled Mount Vanhaitsma and brought 
back the heads of two frost giants slain by your own hand, the Knights 
of the Iron Glacier aren't interested in your application for 
membership!" A prestige class may also have a code of conduct to which 
the character must adhere, or even require further specific actions or 
accomplishments to continue gaining levels. </p>
<p align="left">Making your prestige classes specific and robustly 
developed should take care of the "problem" of characters routinely 
taking multiple prestige classes. Tying each class to an organization 
places another limit on characters who take more than one prestige 
class, since organizations typically don't want members of other groups 
poaching their secrets. By the same token, a character who has been a 
member of one group might not be welcome in another. Some closely allied
 organizations might allow simultaneous membership -- or at least tend 
to be receptive to ex-members of another group who come over to their 
side (though going back to the previous class would probably be 
prohibited). Other classes might require exclusive advancement -- that 
is, a character who stops taking levels in the class has stepped off the
 path and cannot get back onto it. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">If you want to set up your campaign so that taking 
levels in prestige classes is a privilege, not a right, go ahead. But 
make sure your players know the situation up front. Tell them at the 
start that characters have access only to those prestige classes they 
know about from their in-game experiences and actions, and that they 
should not assume that a particular class is available just because they
 saw it in a book. But since this tactic keeps some of the campaign 
information hidden from players and forces PCs to jump through 
roleplaying hoops to gain prestige class opportunities, make sure you 
don't penalize them with punitive game mechanical requirements at the 
same time. What makes a class prestigious is what PCs have to do to 
progress in it, so keep that emphasis in mind when determining entry 
requirements. Make the prerequisites and other requirements memorable 
and important, and ensure that your players have to earn access to these
 classes. This method ensures that the prestige class remains more than 
just another line on the character sheet class list. </p>
