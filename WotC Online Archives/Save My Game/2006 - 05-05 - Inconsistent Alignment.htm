<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Players Flip-Flop on Their Alignments</h4>
<p><i>What do you do with an idiot that keeps changing his alignment to 
act crazy when he roll plays, but changes it back every other time we do
 something?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- fefnir, Wizards message boards</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2005-05%20-%20Inconsistent%20Alignment_files/dndimages5N_Gallery90017.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="284" width="200">That's
 an easy one. Alignment should be a determining factor in how you play 
your character; it's a cipher for the approach to life and the world you
 say you have adopted. If, like with this joker, it doesn't, then you 
have to remember the other part of alignment: It is how life and the 
universe approach you. If you act evil, speak evil, and do evil, then 
when someone casts detect evil on you it's going to come up showing that
 you are evil, regardless of what you have written on your character 
sheet. Your holy weapon will start giving you a negative level, your 
good NPC allies will abandon or turn on you, and all the crying that 
"I'm good, I'm good, see it's right here!" doesn't mean a darn thing. </p>
<p>The 1st Edition <b>AD&amp;D</b><i>Dragonlance Adventures</i> and <i>Greyhawk Adventures</i>
 actually had a system for the DM to track alignment. The player would 
choose initial alignment, but after that the DM kept track of where the 
PC's alignment might drift based on their actions. I used this system 
for a campaign many years ago, and it's not that much work -- just a 
tally sheet on your DMing notepad. You should have a good understanding 
of what alignments mean in your game, and make sure that is communicated
 to players, so when someone's alignment changes they won't have any 
reason to fuss about you unfairly interfering with their character. </p>
<p>Even if you don't use a strict accounting method like this to keep 
track of alignment, you are the arbiter of what alignment means. Some 
people say alignments are unrealistic because they constrain 
role-playing. Others say that if you don't have alignments, everyone's 
alignment ends up being chaotic neutral (or maybe 'selfish bastard'). In
 the end, it's a description of what the character is and does, and if 
it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck then it's probably a duck.
 </p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Short Game Sessions</h4>
<p><i>My game is taking place during recess and lunch at school, a 
period of 15 and 30 minutes, respectively. My biggest dilemma is 
leveling up, as my play group is composed of relatively new players (Two
 of moderate experience, one who won't shut up and has almost no 
experience, and one who has a problem thinking for himself.) and I often
 spend entire play sessions getting everyone's levels situated. I guess 
what I'm asking is how can I put as much play as I can into as little 
time as I can. </i></p>
<p align="right">-- Ralvuimego, Wizards message boards </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2005-05%20-%20Inconsistent%20Alignment_files/90030.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="240" width="200">Welcome
 to the club. Even gamers who have been at it for ages can chew up most 
of a game session leveling up, going on shopping trips, and doing all 
sorts of other non-adventuring stuff. The simplest solution is to have 
people level up their characters outside of game time, but that may not 
work if you don't have multiple books or for the inexperienced players. 
You could try to meet with them separately before or after school to do 
the level-up. I would also advise you to not award xp in the middle of 
the session. I've never been a fan of the instantaneous, 
video-game-style level-up. While I don't use training rules like I did 
back in <b>AD&amp;D</b>, I do require characters to 'sleep on it' -- to 
overnight rest and reflect on their experiences -- before they actually 
collect their xp and level up. This makes it more convenient to schedule
 the real-world book work of leveling up at a time when you're not in 
the middle of things. </p>
<p>Also, have players plan ahead, at least for their next level. You 
have a number of sessions between each level increase, so they have 
plenty of time to think about what they want to add, rather than not 
thinking about it until the moment is upon them. This way, once you 
actually get the xp, it's a simple matter of adding your new bonuses and
 such and getting right back into the game. For that matter, players 
could make up a new character sheet with the character's leveled-up 
stats and just switch to the new sheet when the xp are earned. 
(transferring any current damage, spells already cast, money spent, 
etc.). </p>
<p>Your other problem is transit time. If you have only 15 minutes, and 
it takes several minutes to get to the game and set up, and then to get 
from there to class afterward, you really have only a few minutes in the
 middle to play. There's not a lot you can fit into that short a time. 
Lunch is longer but has its own distractions (i.e., eating!). When I ran
 games in school, we tried to play before or after school, but that 
depends on who needs to take the bus or has other extracurricular 
activities. </p>
<p>The best advice is for everyone to stay focused on the game, minimize
 the distractions and side conversations (especially from Mr. 
Won't-Shut-Up), and avoid rule arguments. Make sure that you are 
organized and prepared so you don't have to spend time during the game 
looking things up. Be prepared with a quick summary (just a few 
sentences should do) of what happened last time in case someone asks. In
 combat, make sure people are paying attention and planning what they 
are going to do so that when their turn comes they don't have to waste 
time pondering. Realize also that you may only be able to fit in one 
significant combat or role-playing encounter, and accept that as part of
 how your game is going to be. Don't try to do too much in the time you 
have or everyone will get frustrated. It may take several weeks of bits 
and pieces to get through an adventure. It's not the ideal situation, 
but you fit in what you can fit in and keep the dice rolling.</p>
