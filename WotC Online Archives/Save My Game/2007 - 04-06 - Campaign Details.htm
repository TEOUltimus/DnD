<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Too Much Information</h4>
<p><i>I'm playing in a game where the DM has done an extensive amount of
 very good work --painted maps, elaborate setups, and detailed cities. 
However, our party is bored to tears. Somewhere during the second night 
of playing we finally stumbled onto the adventure hook after wading 
through tons of red herrings. He's inviting us to interact with his 
world and find our way, but we have absolutely no reason to do so. We 
finally found a pack of goblins and were thrilled to actually fight. 
We've played three times and are still Level 1. Basically, how do I get 
him to make the game more engaging without hurt feelings?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Epic42 from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>The beauty of <i>D&amp;D</i> is that the possibilities for style of 
play and presentation of the campaign are limited only by the time, 
effort, and interest of the people sitting around the table. The tragedy
 of <i>D&amp;D</i> is that sometimes we confuse time and effort with 
interest or think that the amount of time and effort we spend somehow 
earns us a certain degree of interest. Here's a news flash for all DM's 
out there -- <b>Your players, for the most part, are not nearly as interested in your complex plots and elaborate setups as you are.</b></p>
<p>And you know what? That's OK.</p>
<p>The game offers different rewards for the different roles involved in playing. Since the beginning of the game, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dd/20051104a">inside jokes and small nuggets of amusement</a>
 have been dropped into adventures and rulebooks that, unless the DM 
takes pains to point them out for the players, no one will ever notice 
or get except for the DM. I did this with an adventure I wrote for <i>Dungeon</i>
 magazine that contained a number of hidden references and gags. Some 
people on an FR message board eventually noticed the pattern of the '<a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/news/20070401a">Easter eggs</a>' I had hidden in the adventure and howled at how having noticed it just destroyed the entire flavor of the adventure.</p>
<p>But that is true only if you were actually reading the adventure 
closely, as a DM might, and spending time puzzling over anagrams and 
faintly familiar details that crop up -- the sort of things you can 
notice when you are reading but that would slide right by without notice
 on hearing, especially when you encounter the bits and pieces of the 
puzzle over the course of several weeks (or longer) of play rather than 
in the space of an hour. Some things are for the DM, and the players (if
 not DMs themselves) will rarely if ever notice they're there.</p>
<p>That's all well and good for published adventures, but what about 
your friend, who is right there in front of you putting in all this 
work, creating visual aids, developing complex plots, and creating an 
obscene amount of detail? The truth of the matter is that he is wasting a
 great deal of time and effort if he thinks you are getting the same 
thing out of it that he is. That, however, may not be the case at all. 
He may just be doing it because he enjoys it -- he likes to paint, he 
loves to create maps, he enjoys city development, and so on. If that's 
true, then that is part of his reward as the DM. He gets to spend as 
time as he wants creating. Sure, your party will never, EVER, visit any 
of the six different butcher shops he has painstakingly detailed in the 
city of Townopolis, but if he had fun creating them, then more power to 
him.</p>
<p>The problem comes when, having created those six butcher shops, he 
tries to railroad you through every one of them in a misguided effort to
 validate his investment of time and trouble.</p>
<p>What's the solution? Part of it falls on you, the players. You need 
to recognize your DM and the way he runs a game. He has shown that he 
wants to have a dynamic and interactive world where you have 
opportunity, so you need to <i>get off your butts and do something</i>. The world is there waiting to be engaged -- go out and engage it. Stop waiting for the DM to spoon-feed you the plot.</p>
<p>That said, this is balanced with a warning for the DM -- Don't make 
things so complex that they discourage engagement. If players keep 
trying to make things happen but every effort runs into a dead end or a 
wild goose chase or a secret betrayal, the players will get frustrated 
and stop trying. You want them to engage, but you punish them when they 
do.</p>
<p>You are in a standoff. Both the players and the DM want the other 
side to give them more to work with. You want the DM to be more direct 
and the meat of the campaign to be more accessible. Your DM wants you to
 work for it, to spend time pushing buttons and twisting knobs and 
kicking tires -- manipulating the machine of his campaign. To make the 
campaign fun, you both need to come off of your entrenched position and 
make some moves toward the other side.</p>
<p>This starts with having a frank and open conversation about style of 
play and expectations for the campaign, players and DM alike. Talk about
 speed of advancement, frequency of combat, investigation and 'talking' 
adventures vs. kick-in-the-doors 'hacking' adventures. Heck, talk about 
what kinds of skills, feats, and character classes are likely to be 
relevant in your DM's campaign, and talk about your ideas for the kind 
of characters you would like to be and the kind of adventures you want 
to have. Most importantly, find out what you can and should do when the 
players are out of ideas. While you, the players, don't know everything 
the DM knows about the campaign, your characters for darn sure know a 
lot more than you do, especially ones with high Intelligence and lots of
 Knowledge skills or related class abilities. Use Knowledge and Gather 
Information and Sense Motive and Diplomacy and Intimidate to sift 
through the pile. Don't let it devolve into a battle of wits and wills 
between players and DM. You are playing <i>D&amp;D</i>, you have a character -- <i>use it</i>!</p>
<p>Your DM has created an elaborate campaign world with lots of things 
(including many surprises) for you to see and do. He doesn't want to tip
 his hand and just tell you what to do and what is going to happen, but 
he needs to give you more clues. The DM is playing with a stacked deck, 
because he knows the background information that makes those surprises 
relevant. The players don't, so they have no motivation to look for the 
surprises. What's worse, without the needed background, those surprises 
won't have any real impact when they do appear. If the DM wants his 
elaborate ideas to matter, he must be forthcoming with context while 
still being careful to avoid burying you in details and in-campaign 
history that you will never remember (and, cheapest of all, then nailing
 your character ten sessions later because you forgot to write down some
 detail that your character would have known since childhood).</p>
<p>The difference between a good teacher and a bad teacher is not in how
 much he knows or can recite but in the ability to present it with the 
organization and connections to other things that gives students 
something to grab onto and a means of sorting and retaining what is 
important. This is what your DM needs to learn. Don't just blame him and
 make him do all the work -- he's already done plenty, though he has 
more yet to do. Honestly give a good effort, using both your imagination
 and intuition as players and your resources as characters to find out 
where to go and what to do. If you really are lost, don't be embarrassed
 to ask for a recap, a reminder, or even a suggestion. Your DM wants to 
run a fun adventure as much as you want to play one, so remember, in <i>D&amp;D</i>, you are ultimately all on the same team.</p>
