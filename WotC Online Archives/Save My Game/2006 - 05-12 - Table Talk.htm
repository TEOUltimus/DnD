<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Wait, I Didn't Say That!</h4>
<p><i>How do I get (new) players to play the game as their characters 
and not themselves? I don't want to be an enforcer of only In-Character 
speech. These are my friends and I want them to be able to ask questions
 and even joke a little if it helps them have fun. What are some good 
ways to teach them to be someone else when they face the table?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- hotspike18, Wizards message boards</p>
<p><b>D&amp;D</b> is a role-playing game, but it is not only a 
role-playing game. It is a tactical simulation, an unravel-the-mystery 
game, a puzzle-solving game, a rules and number-crunching game, a 
smash-the-bad guys game, and so on. It is also an excuse to get together
 and hang out with your friends, to pig out on munchies, to swap stories
 and catch up on real life with them. <b>D&amp;D</b> is the focus for 
our interaction at the gaming table, but the game is an event that goes 
beyond what is happening 'inside' the game. </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2005-12%20-%20Table%20Talk_files/sg_20060512a1.jpg" alt="'Leave my mother out of it!'" title="'Leave my mother out of it!'" align="right" border="0" height="460" width="200">I say all that to make it clear that <b>D&amp;D</b>
 has many aspects. You need to think about how much you want players "to
 be someone else when they face the table." Sure, the in-game experience
 is more immersive if all talk is in character, but it does present 
problems like those you mention above. Likewise, what about you, the DM?
 Much of what you have to say is (in movie terms) a voice-over, 
exposition about what is happening but not actually someone talking. 
When do the PCs know when you are Lady Rovin talking and when you are 
telling them something as Clary the DM? What latitude do players have to
 describe what they are doing without speaking? </p>
<p>There is a style issue here -- is a player in character when she says
 "Anucha sneaks over and uses Sleight of Hand to swipe the jewel," or 
should she say "I sneak over and subtly palm the jewel"? If talking in 
character, should players use game terms such as the names of skills, 
feats, spells, and class abilities? In character, they wouldn't know 
what levels, hit points, and such are. Clarify what is and is not 
allowed when talking 'in character'.</p>
<p>Finally, if you do want to use a strict 'player = character' rule in 
conversation, where everything the player says is something the 
character says, I suggest you make it time- and context-limited. No one 
wants to sit for three hours feeling that they can't say "I need to use 
the bathroom" for fear of getting humiliated in-game. Maybe you have a 
particular light (or even a candle) that is lit, or some other item that
 is placed out in full view to indicate times when everyone is 
'on-screen' and must talk in character. Once that episode is completed, 
the item is removed, and you go back to gamer-speak. Alternatively, each
 player could have such an item, or you could use a universal signal 
(e.g., raising your hand) to indicate when you need to ask something 
out-of-character during those in-character episodes. </p>
<p>Whatever method you use, make sure that the signals are clear and 
everyone understands them, to avoid complaints of "No, no, my character 
didn't say that!" Also, realize that this might be a style your players 
aren't interested in playing (in reference to your second question). You
 need to balance your desire with the desires of others to 'just play 
the game' and not engage in theatrics. </p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Character-on-Character Violence</h4>
<p><i>The rule we operate with is that no PvP combat is allowed, with 
the exception of rare cases, and the results don't affect in game play. 
However, if that doesn't work, here's another idea. Have the party join 
an adventurer's guild or some sort of organization. Make one of the 
bylaws that intraparty violence with result in a forfeiture of pay to 
the guild, and a suspension from adventuring work. Then make sure the 
guild has a near monopoly on things the adventurers can do, kind of like
 the Hero's guild in Fable.</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Jager Mage, Wizards message board</p>
<p>I guess I've been blessed over the years to rarely have to deal with PCs attacking other PCs, setting aside people getting <i>charmed</i>, <i>confused</i>, <i>dominated</i>,
 etc., and forced to attack each other. Dealing with the problem depends
 on your style. As an out-of-character house rule, you can simply forbid
 PCs from attacking each other. "But that's not realistic!" says the 
angry player. "Who cares?" says the DM and the other players who don't 
want to deal with one or two players hijacking the gaming session for 
their own selfish feud. You make the game more fun for everyone when the
 players don't need to watch their backs all the time. </p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2005-12%20-%20Table%20Talk_files/sg_20060512a2.jpg" alt="Character-on-Character Violence is Not Good!" title="Character-on-Character Violence is Not Good!" align="right" border="0" height="270" width="400">This
 is no different from a house rule that you can't play evil characters 
or monsters as PCs. It is a conscious decision to constrain choices 
during character creation in order to reduce friction, dissent, 
argument, and messiness down the road. We've all read stories where the 
secret, double agent betrays the heroes at a crucial moment, but where 
do you go from there? The double agent essentially becomes an NPC once 
his cover is blown. What is the upside of turning on the party? That 
your PC ceases to be playable? Some fun. Admittedly, it's heavy-handed, 
but it's effective. </p>
<p>Your second option makes more sense in-game. Most adventurers work 
for themselves. They don't have bosses who tell them what to do and 
where to go and mete out discipline when they don't toe the line. 
Adventurers don't get 'paid' -- they take a share of the loot when 
they're adventuring. Forcing them to join a guild in order to go 
adventuring allows you to control things that way, but there are some 
problems. </p>
<p>How does the guild enforce its monopoly? Is knowledge of adventure 
locales something only the guild possesses? Does it guard the gates of 
known dungeons to make sure only card-carrying members go inside? What 
happens if you go adventuring somewhere that's not a sanctioned 
'adventure locale'? How does the guild regulate city adventures? 
Wilderness? Other planes? Having a monopolistic adventuring guild works 
fine inside a computer game where your options are restricted to 
whatever the programmers decide you can do. In a live <b>D&amp;D</b> 
campaign, the players can do (or try to do) anything they think up, and 
the resources required for an adventuring guild to be a monopoly are 
unplayably vast. </p>
<p>Still, the idea is not without merit, if the focus is shifted a bit. Adventurers could require licenses or charters (as in <i>Forgotten Realms</i>),
 without which they might be arrested or stripped of their goods (or at 
least heavily taxed) upon returning to civilized lands. Perhaps some of 
what they sign up for when they sign the charter is an agreement not to 
fight amongst themselves. How the in-game authorities could keep track 
of this is another matter. Perhaps the ink to sign the charter is 
magical and changes color if you betray the charter. Perhaps you sign 
two charters, one to take with you and one for the royal archives, and 
both copies register transgressions. </p>
<p>You could definitely use this model if you were playing an <i>Oriental Adventures</i>
 campaign or a similar game wherein some, most, or all of the PCs are in
 service to a liege lord. The party undertakes missions on behalf of its
 daimyo/master and returns with the job done. Characters are bound by 
oaths of honor not to squabble (perhaps with magical reinforcement). In 
this model of campaign, PCs wouldn't bother to loot the dead (and for 
that matter, fewer monsters would have treasure), because the model of 
wealth distribution is different from a standard <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign
 where PCs need to amass significant resources on their own. Rewards are
 not found lying on the ground or on the bodies of the fallen, but in 
the form of wages and gifts from their master for a job well done. PCs 
who violate the master's wishes should certainly suffer the 
consequences. </p>
<p>This model can also be used if you assume PCs are essentially super 
secret agents or commandos, or even if they are basically superheroes. 
Whether working for a powerful church, spiritual oaths to nature, secret
 society, mercenary company, or merchant guild, certain rules must be 
followed. Yes, you can violate the rules of one group and move on to the
 next, but you will quickly acquire a bad reputation and may have 
trouble finding work, or receive less pay, or feel less trust from those
 who hire you to do a job -- perhaps to the point where <i>they</i> betray <i>you</i>. </p>
