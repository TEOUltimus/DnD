<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Too Tough to Play</h4>
<p><i>I've been trying to design my fighter as a tank, giving him special Interlocking plate (</i>+2 adamantine<i>)
 and some defensive feats like Combat Expertise, Heavy Armor 
Optimization, etc. So I have a base AC of 24, and when I move less then 
10 feet, it's 25. If I use Combat Expertise, I can get it up to 30 or 
more. The real problem is I can't get any of the monsters to attack me! I
 can't possibly keep up with the </i>fireballs<i> and </i>scorching rays <i>of our sorcerer or the </i>sonic lances <i>of our favored soul, or even the 3d6 Sneak Attacks of our dual wielding rogue. What can I do to keep the monsters focused on me?<br> P.S. -- I'm a dwarf with Charisma 6, so I think Goad is out.</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Charles, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes from earlier versions of <i>D&amp;D</i> to
 3rd Edition was the huge increase in the importance of speed and 
tactical movement. Yes, it's always been important, but 3rd Edition is 
more explicitly tied to miniatures, battle mats, and precise measurement
 of movement. In that environment, the difference between fast and slow 
is greatly emphasized. Your character, unfortunately, is on the wrong 
end of that design philosophy.</p>
<p><img src="2007%20-%2002-02%20-%20Too%20Tough%20to%20Play_files/dnd_sg_20070202_tordek.jpg" alt="The Doctrine of Deterrence" title="The Doctrine of Deterrence" align="right" border="0" height="240" width="200">It's
 also a question of play style, because being a slow-moving tank is not 
so bad if your campaign is based around kicking in dungeon doors and 
bashing the inhabitants. You can serve as the party's meat shield, in 
that you can interpose yourself between your enemies and the softer, 
juicier party members behind you. Even though your enemies may be 
faster, you can cut the angle on their advance, especially if you have a
 reach weapon. Their movement advantage is neutralized by the terrain 
(in this case, dungeon walls and corridors) that forces them to come 
through your threatened space.</p>
<p>If you end up outdoors or in wide open spaces, quicker enemies 
(assuming they have even a modicum of tactical sense or survival 
instinct) can literally run circles around you, and there's nothing you 
can do about it but wait and hope that they come to you. This is why a 
prestige class such as the dwarven defender is useful only in limited 
circumstances. Sure, your defensive stance is great, but if you plant 
yourself on the ground and power up, and then your enemies just run 
around you, you've become the world's toughest tree stump rather than an
 effective combatant.</p>
<p>It's true that the Goad feat would be a good idea if you had the Charisma to pull it off. The Knight class from <i>Player's Handbook II </i>has
 similar abilities to challenge enemies and induce them to attack the 
knight in preference to others. Short of that, you could, in theory, 
have allies use magic to channel enemies your way (<i>fear </i>to make them flee through your area, or <i>charm </i>or <i>suggestion </i>to
 come close to you). Those either seem like overkill, a lucky 
coincidence of the main effect of the spell, or at best an inefficient 
use of resources.</p>
<p>Aside from these game design 'problems' getting in your way, it sounds like you have two issues. One is that this is tabletop <i>D&amp;D</i>,
 not a computer game. In computer games, the monsters are pretty much 
irresistibly attracted to the characters. If you meet them, they will 
come to you. The tank works great in this situation, because the idea of
 monsters never rushing up to you doesn't happen, or not very often. You
 go out there, AC up, and suck up the attacks while the offensive 
characters bust out the killpower. Your own attacks are incidental -- 
you are mostly there just to get in the way and soak up damage.</p>
<p><i>D&amp;D</i> is a little more demanding. Part of that is because 
the DM running the game is apt to notice and counter PC strategies. You 
need a backup plan for when your primary strategy doesn't work. If this 
happens all the time, it is worth asking the DM if you have built a bad 
character for her style of game. You don't need to ask the DM to pile 
the monsters on you as if they are pouring out of a funnel, but if the 
monsters can (and do) always just run around your character and 
neutralize his strength, you have a bad fit for the game, just like a 
mounted combat specialist who's always stuck in some cave or dungeon or 
sewer without his horse. Talking to the DM may cause her to reconsider 
her strategy or at least to pay attention to whether she is singling out
 your character for neutering. If it seems that the character is a bad 
fit, you could ask to replace or redesign the character. There are 
plenty of folks who will tell you that the super-AC build is best when 
combined with a completely unarmored character with high Dexterity and 
AC bonuses, such as the monk or ninja class. Maybe a fast warrior is 
what will work in the campaign. That's kind of a bummer, though, if what
 you really want to play is a clanking dwarf fighter.</p>
<p>Although it sounds at first as if your problem arises from tactical 
issues in the game, it's possible that the real issue is frustration 
that your character doesn't mesh well with the other characters in your 
party,. You see the other players with characters that are successful 
and effective, and your character seems impotent by comparison. That 
makes the game less fun. I get that, and you have a point, but you sort 
of painted yourself into that corner with the attempt at a super-defense
 build.</p>
<p>If you want the monsters to attack you, you have two choices -- 
either make yourself a more inviting target, or else take the fight to 
them and force them to respond.</p>
<p>In the first case, a simple and relatively cheap option would be adding the <i>glamered </i>property
 to your armor. That way, while you will still clank loudly, you can 
look as if you are wearing no armor at all. An enemy seeing a dwarf 
encased head to toe in solid steel is likely to look for an easier 
target. An enemy seeing a dwarf wearing a dirty loincloth and a rough, 
hide cloak may think he's found an easy target. By the time he gets 
close enough to realize you are really hard to hit, you've locked him in
 melee.</p>
<p>In taking the fight to your foes, beg, borrow, or steal some <i>boots of striding and springing</i> or <i>boots of speed </i>, or a <i>longstrider </i>or <i>haste </i>spell, or something such as <i>winged boots </i>--
 anything to enhance your mobility. You don't need to wait and hope that
 enemies will come to you when you can go to them. They can either fight
 back, or they can just suck it up and absorb the pain. You may look 
like a slow, lumbering dwarf, but you can run like a gazelle when you 
need to. Whether trying to attack or defend, you must be able to move.</p>
<p>You can also extend your effective combat range by arming yourself 
with a reach weapon. These are usually two-handed, meaning you can't use
 a shield. You can gain reach by finding or commissioning magic items 
that increase your size or with a feat such as Lunging Strike. You can 
also make sure you have missile weapons available -- f you can't reach 
them, you can still attack them. Weapons you can use in melee or at 
range are handy for this, though ranged attacks preclude using Combat 
Expertise.</p>
<p>Finally, adjust your playing style. Make sure your character always 
stays next to other characters, so if the bad guys want to attack them, 
they have to deal with you at the same time. You can't be everywhere at 
once, but you should be able to stay in the thick of the action.</p>
