<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Problem: Players Want House Rules</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2004-28%20-%20House%20Rules_files/savemygame_houserule.jpg" align="right" border="0"><i>I
 have a player in my game that tries to push me into installing 
different house rules that he would like. It is really annoying. I just 
want everyone to enjoy the game as much as possible, and as there are 
few roleplayers in my area I don`t want anyone to become offended, 
because I am afraid to lose players!</i><b>-- DmMagnus, Wizards message boards</b></p>
<p align="left">Stand firm, and see the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20060421a">previous column</a>
 about dealing with difficult players. The player who makes a lot of 
demands for house rules -- and in this I include official, published 
rules that you aren't using in your game -- is something between a 
cheater and a jerk. You want everyone to enjoy the game as much as 
possible. You will accomplish this best by avoiding giving in to one 
player's selfish pressure to inject things into the game just to make 
more enjoyable for him. As the DM for all of the players, you need to 
make sure that any house rules you add increase the enjoyment of all the
 players, not just one.</p>
<p align="left">That doesn't mean you should be a jerk in return. Your 
player might have some good or interesting ideas that are worth hearing,
 and you can often improve your game by listening to the suggestions of 
players. The problem is that it appears he's already pushed beyond the 
realm of helpful suggestions and food for thought into nagging and 
weaseling. You need to be clear and firm that the rules for the campaign
 are those that are currently in play. Perhaps once a year or once every
 six months you could ask players for suggestions about house rules, and
 then the group can discuss them together. In the end, you decide 
whether they seem like good ideas for your campaign.</p>
<p align="left">If nothing else, you can suggest that this player 
incorporate these rules into his game the next time he sits behind the 
screen as DM!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Problem: Interpreting Alignments</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>The confusion really comes out when you talk about 
law/chaos. To most, they think that a lawful character is likely to 
follow the law, while chaotic characters tend to break the law; however,
 I think it would be better understood that a lawful character is 
disciplined and follows routines and set actions, while a chaotic 
character is more spontaneous and creative in their approach to things. 
Now my problem is how to best explain this without confusing my players,
 and it would be great if there was a sole article from the experts that
 I could have to give them so they could understand the differences 
between Law and Chaos.</i><b>-- Kefka_Casselstone, Wizards message boards</b></p>
<p align="left">Some questions just keep coming up. Alignment in general
 and law and chaos in particular are common subjects. I could refer you 
to an earlier column, <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20050325a">Lawful and Chaotic</a>,
 from last March, but really, you already have the answer to your 
question. The way you've explained it above is a fine way to explain it 
to your players without confusing them. Law is about consistency, 
routine, cohesiveness, organization, planning, consistency, regularity, 
order, reliability, tradition -- and did I mention consistency? Chaos is
 about freedom, intuition, spontaneity, whimsy, individuality, 
independence, impulsivity, and living and reacting in the moment.</p>
<p align="left">When you talk about laws, what you're mostly talking 
about is rules of conduct and whether and why people obey them. A lawful
 character may obey local laws wherever he goes, but he does it because 
it's part of his personal code of behavior. Chaotics are every bit as 
capable of being obedient as lawfuls, but a chaotic person's reasons for
 obeying center around self-interest or individual relationships and 
feelings. Similarly, a chaotic might adopt a subversive attitude as a 
matter of principle while a lawful could be just as subversive but would
 approach it in a reasoned, calculated, and organized way. In this case,
 their actions may end up the same, but the motivations and the 
methodology will differ between lawful and chaotic characters.</p>
<p align="left">Have a little confidence. As the DM, you are the sole 
expert on your campaign. Your explanation is more than clear and should 
be ample, but perhaps the above will help as well.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Problem: Incorporating Psionics</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2004-28%20-%20House%20Rules_files/savemygame_psion.jpg" align="right" border="0"><i>I don't yet have the </i>Expanded Psionics Handbook<i>,
 and I'm a little leery of putting psionics into play. Specific 
question: How hard is it for a psionics "newb" to incorporate these 
rules into play? What special considerations will need to be taken into 
account? What changes (if any) will need to be made to existing 
monsters, especially ones that use psionic-type attacks?</i><b>-- sorites, Wizards message boards</b></p>
<p align="left">Another perennial issue is psionics. This was also covered in a <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20060310a">previous column</a> (as well as a previous <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/tt/20060207a">Tactics &amp; Tips</a>), but because you asked the question specifically, I'll answer it specifically.</p>
<p align="left">The <i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i> does a nice job of
 telling you the changes needed to existing monsters, especially psionic
 ones. The problem is, to use psionics, you need to introduce a whole 
new set of mechanics to the game. A psionics-oriented player is apt to 
know these rules more intimately than you do.</p>
<p align="left">Psionics don't <i>look</i> much different from magic, 
but in actual play they are significantly different. A psion can use all
 of his power points to 'cast high level spells'; a Sor/Wiz can't. There
 is balance, because psions tend to run out of juice long before the 
Sor/Wiz, but if your campaign allows rest periods between major 
encounters, this limitation on psions becomes meaningless. I don't mean 
to imply that psionics are overpowered, but their balance is different. 
You can't run the campaign the same way you did before introducing 
psionic characters.</p>
<p align="left">Psionic characters also require you to deal with psionic
 feats, psionic foci, mingling psionic and magical items in treasure, 
psionic NPCs, psionic monsters, psionic-related spells, etc.</p>
<p align="left">If you are new to psionics, my advice (as someone who 
really likes psionics) is: don't use them until you learn them and are 
comfortable with the rules.</p>
<p align="left">Psionics are cool, but wait until you familiar with the system. Meanwhile, you can still use psionic creatures from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 with spell-like abilities, and they will work fine. When and if you 
decide to start using real psionics, begin with a shallow dip -- maybe 
an adventure to a faraway land or another plane where the PCs meet an 
honest-to-goodness psionic monster using the psionic rules. See how the 
rules work in an actual game a time or three. Allow a psionic cohort or 
NPC ally to join the party for a time. If things work poorly, the NPC 
can disappear. If it works well, it may be time to open the portal to 
psionic PCs.</p>
