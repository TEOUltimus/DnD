</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Psionics are a tricky beast in <b>D&amp;D</b>. Always 
have been. The biggest problem is that they are not now and never have 
been a really core-integrated part of the rules. The psionics rules are 
integral within themselves, and they are connected to the core rules in 
ways that are not hard to understand if you choose to study them. But 
you don't have to. Because of this, you end up with a situation in which
 only players interested in psionics will choose to learn about 
psionics. Others will not. If the 'not' group includes the DM, you have a
 problem, because how is the DM supposed to administer the rules fairly 
in an area where he is not an expert? To whom in the group can the DM 
appeal for rules clarification on psionics if the psionic-player is the 
only one with a firm grasp of them? </p>
<p align="left">Besides, even if the psionic-player is doing everything 
perfectly by the book, it may still feel to others that the player is 
cheating. Further, the higher frequency of strange rules, unexpected 
results, and the need for rules clarifications and explanations (which 
often are just different enough from standard rules to confuse or annoy)
 is bound to make that player's turn take longer than others in combat, 
with the added frustration of the psionic-player's actions being harder 
to understand and figure out for those who are not experts on the 
psionic system.</p>
<p align="left">I state all the above as someone who has always liked 
psionics and used them in my campaigns, but also has someone who has 
driven DMs and even other players to distraction when playing a psionic 
character (to the point where two DMs gave up and outlawed psionics 
mid-campaign rather than dealing any further with the issue).</p>
<p align="left">Many people feel like psionics is more a sci-fi or 
superhero element that doesn't fit with fantasy, so you have to decide 
if psionics are even to your taste as part of D&amp;D. You can run 
classic psionic monsters like mind flayers and intellect devourers using
 spell-like or supernatural abilities instead, so do you really need to 
have psionics as a rule set to incorporate mind-warping horrors into the
 campaign? No, you don't. But since you asked what to adjust if you do 
want to put psionics in the campaign, your options are these:</p>
<p align="left"><b>1. Go All the Way</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2003-10%20-%20Psionics_files/dx0310sg_savemygame_psionic3_jpg.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="350" width="202">The most dominant implementation of psionics in the history of <b>D&amp;D</b> was in the <a target="_blank" href="http://boards1.wizards.com/forumdisplay.php?f=290">2nd Edition</a><i>Dark Sun</i>
 setting. Why? Because every character was psionic, at least with wild 
talents, so every player had to have at least a passing familiarity with
 the basics of the psionic system. Most monsters were psionic, so the DM
 also had to be familiar with the system. Treasure tables included both 
magical and psionic items. On top of that, the campaign setting had 
certain social restrictions on the use of arcane magic that made 
psionics a comparatively attractive option rather than just being a 
wizard (or a sorcerer in 3rd Edition, the most comparable class to the 
psion, if you were to use a similar world with the current version of <b>D&amp;D</b>).
 Psionics were always right there in front of you as you went through 
the rule system, so you didn't have to go looking for them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>2. Psionics, What the Heck is That?</b></p>
<p align="left">At the opposite end of the spectrum is a world where 
psionics exist, but they are very rare. Most people have never heard of 
them and wouldn't know what to make of them if they saw them, other than
 to assume it was just some different type of magic. Psionic items are 
almost never found as treasure, and psionic monsters are rarely 
encountered because there simply are not many around. Perhaps they 
cluster in certain enclaves, deep in the Underdark or on remote islands 
or mountain ranges or monasteries. Perhaps most (if not all) 
psionics-wielders belong to secret societies that teach their art hidden
 from view of the masses.</p>
<p align="left">For the learned arcane and divine wielders of magic, 
their reaction to encounters with psionics users will depend radically 
on whether you use the 'psionics are different' option, in which 
psionics operate on a different 'frequency' from other forms of 
supernatural powers. As a result, they cannot be detected, dispelled, or
 suppressed by things that affect magic. An antimagic field holds no 
terror for a psionics user because he is not using magic. At the same 
time, a null psionics field would do nothing against a wizard's power. 
Knowledge (psionics) and Knowledge (arcana) are very different skills, 
as are Use Psionic vs. Magic Device, or Psicraft vs. Spellcraft.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2003-10%20-%20Psionics_files/dx0310sg_savemygame_psionic1_jpg.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="189" width="214">Because
 of the potential for psionics users to break the rules of arcane and 
divine magic, it is likely that wielders of magic view psionics users 
with suspicion at best and more likely outright enmity. Psions would be 
hunted as dangerous and uncontrollable renegades against the natural 
order of the universe who are probably in league with unspeakable 
aberrations from beyond the stars. Psionic characters must either become
 very good at hiding their craft or disguising it as ordinary magic when
 they use their art publicly (the inverse of what arcane spellcasters 
had to do in <i>Dark Sun </i>campaigns).</p>
<p align="left">'Psionics are different' is an idea that is very 
attractive on the surface. It clearly marks out psionics as distinct 
from arcane and divine magic, but it creates enormous in-game problems 
in my experience, as well as exacerbating all of the problems noted at 
the beginning of this column. You could cobble together rules that allow
 psionics and magic to interact in a restricted way (like ordinary magic
 and Shadow Weave magic from <i>Forgotten Realms</i>) in order to moderate some of the game-breaking effects, but my advice is: That way lies madness!</p>
<p align="left">If you rule that psionics operate in the same way as 
magic, psionics are apt to be viewed as an exotic nonesuch but are 
unlikely to elicit outright hostility any more than any other 
profession, unless you choose to create cultural or societal issues for 
them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>3. Psionics? Yeah, Whatever ...</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2003-10%20-%20Psionics_files/dx0310sg_savemygame_psionic2_jpg.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="203" width="178">In
 the middle, you have the typical approach -- partial integration of 
psionics. Psionic characters, monsters, and items are freely available 
just as magical ones are, though the finding of psionic items is likely 
to be less than the finding of magical ones if only because of DM 
inertia -- it's one less book to look through when selecting treasure or
 encounters. By ruling that psionics are simply uncommon (rather than 
very rare), you still position them as less common than ordinary magic 
and monsters. Psionic characters are just like every other kind of 
character, attracting no more or less attention than people with other 
career paths and sources of power.</p>
<p align="left">While this resolves in-game complications, sitting 
around the table, you will still face the problems I described at the 
beginning. At the very least, you should have a group discussion about 
what people at the table think about psionics. If you have a player who 
really wants to do it, consider their request, but you as the DM are the
 decision maker. If you are not willing to put in the time to learn the 
psionic system, then, like any rules subset you're unfamiliar or 
uncomfortable with, you probably shouldn't allow psionics use in your 
campaign.</p>
