<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> What's the Best Level for a New Campaign?</h4><i>I 
am fairly new to this concept and have a few questions: Every time you 
play a different campaign, do you start a new character at a low level?</i><p align="right">-- Kevin, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>Welcome to <i>D&amp;D</i>, Kevin! We will answer your first question first and get to your others next time. You also might look at our <a href="#tutorials">Tutorial series</a> for more advice on creating characters and getting started as a new player.</p>
<p>The question of what level your campaign should start at depends on 
the preference of the players and the DM. What kind of game do you want?
 Do you want to start out playing as a big shot, someone who has already
 made their mark and developed their skills? This is part of the 
attraction of superhero games -- you start out already being super! 
Sure, you can slowly or incrementally advance your character, but at the
 time of creation you are already bench-pressing 747s and leaping tall 
buildings in a single bound and bending the power of the atom to your 
will with your mind.</p>
<p>Or do you want to start off as the wide-eyed apprentice or country 
boy or light-fingered sneak trying to find her destiny? The whole world 
of possibility is open to you, and you get to enjoy the journey.</p>
<p>Clearly, starting at 1st level isn't mandatory. If you are new to the
 game, however, I recommend that you do start at 1st level. I say this 
not because 1st level is inherently more fun than higher levels -- in 
some ways that's true, and in some ways it's not. People who have played
 the game since the 1970s or 80s honestly disagree on their favorite 
level for play.</p>
<p>As for starting at 1st level, I say that is the way to go, especially
 for a relatively new player, because it is easier to understand the 
rules of the game and how to play when you are at lower levels. No 
matter how many times you read the <i>Player's Handbook </i>or any other
 rule books, there's no substitute for actually trying things at the 
game table to see how you like the feel and operation of different kinds
 of characters. This is true in terms of developing a personality for a 
character, in the context of the party and the game world, because that 
character has a chance to mature and develop. Your original character 
concept gives you a starting point, but then you develop a history -- 
not just an individual history but a shared history with the rest of 
your party -- that breathes life into a character throughout the course 
of the campaign. Sure, you can start a higher-level character with a 
pre-made history, but it will never carry the same weight in your 
concept of the character and the fit of that character within the party 
as if you had actually played it all out.</p>
<p>Maybe more important than your character development, though, is the 
mechanical side of the game. It pays to know the rules and to be able to
 look ahead, but tons of feats and spells and magic items and monsters 
will not come into play until later levels. Thus, your resources limit 
your choices. When you have only 200 gp, you don't need to choose 
between buying a magic wand or a suit of full plate armor, to research a
 new spell or start building a castle and staffing it with servants and 
soldiers, because you can't afford any of them! You need to plan within 
your means, so most shopping trips are pretty short and to the point.</p>
<p>Your qualifications also limit your choices. Your feat choices are 
limited by the prerequisites you meet. You can stick with base classes, 
because prestige classes are outside your reach. You have only so many 
skill points to allocate, so you focus on the skills that are really 
important to your character.</p>
<p>The biggest place where lower level is easier, though, is combat. At 
high level, characters can do so many things that it is often hard to 
decide what to do. Should you use temporary or permanent magic items, 
use special class abilities or feats, command cohorts or followers or 
summoned monsters? With the right spells or feats, characters can act 
even when it's not their turn or act multiple times within their own 
turn. At low level, the turnaround is quick, the choices are simpler, 
and things move much more smoothly. Sure, there is still room for 
creativity and cleverness in combat or otherwise -- in some ways, it is 
more important than at high levels, because you don't have the resources
 or firepower to just blast your way through challenges (combat or 
otherwise).</p>
<p>It's OK to start a campaign at whatever level everyone likes the 
most, but if you are new to the game, take the time to enjoy the 
low-level experience, and don't rush ahead. A lot of the mystery and the
 magic and the fun of the game can only grow if you give it time.</p>
