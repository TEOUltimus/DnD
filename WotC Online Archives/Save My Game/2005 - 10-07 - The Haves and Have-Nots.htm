in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas

<p align="left">This installment of <i>Save My Game</i> examines what 
happens when some characters in a party need a lot of equipment to 
maintain their fighting edge and others don't. What's a DM to do if a 
couple of PCs need a disproportionate amount of the loot? What's the 
fairest way to make sure everyone has what he needs?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: It's Not Always about the Stuff</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>In my current campaign, two of the PCs (a 
fighter/Order of the Bow initiate and a fighter/kensai) depend on their 
equipment to get the job done, and the other two (a monk/fist of Zouken,
 and a psion) do not. This situation means that the need for cash isn't 
exactly balanced within the party. The monk can make do with almost no 
cash -- all he needs are his fists and some food here and there. The 
same goes for the psion -- his powers are innate. (Being an Elan makes 
it easy to live broke, doesn't it?) But the archer type and the kensai 
really need cash to advance their equipment so that they can continue to
 take a beating in battle. Will this kind of situation cause problems in
 treasure splits? -- </i><b>Adapted from a post by L33tN1nJ4Sabin on the D&amp;D message boards</b></p>
<p align="left">Treasure distribution within a party is a key issue in 
many campaigns, and one that the DM has only a limited ability to 
adjudicate. Should the characters who are dependent on equipment get an 
edge in treasure distribution? Or should the distribution be completely 
unbiased? Let's take a look at this question from a couple of different 
aspects.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Who's Really Best?</b></p>
<p align="left">The primary issue in a case like this one is how much 
any given character depends on stuff to be successful. If the PCs are 
stripped of their equipment and dropped in the middle of a wasteland, 
the monks, sorcerers, druids, and psions suddenly jump to the head of 
the class in terms of power because they can do the most with the least.
 Their class features are not, for the most part, focused on using some 
piece of equipment better -- in fact, most don't require any equipment 
at all. Conversely, at least a few class features of just about every 
other class become useless when the appropriate equipment is 
unavailable. Consider, for example, the fighter's weapon-based feats, or
 the ranger's combat style, or the cleric's ability to cast spells 
wearing heavy armor, or even the wizard's book-based spellcasting.</p>
<p align="left">Viewed from this perspective, the characters who don't 
depend on equipment are much more versatile than those who do. If the 
other characters are to keep up, they obviously need to draw enough of 
the treasure to ensure access to the right stuff. Whether any treasure 
is left for the other characters thereafter becomes a moot point.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Who Benefits More?</b></p>
<p align="left">On the other hand, the mere fact that a character can 
get along better than others without equipment doesn't mean that she 
doesn't need or want equipment to maximize her effectiveness. After all,
 every character takes a beating at some point in the campaign -- even 
the pixie sorcerer who is invisible all the time and takes pains to stay
 miles away from melee! Heck, the party monk is likely to get beaten up 
far more often than the archer/fighter just because the monk has no 
choice but to get up close and personal with the melee mashers of the 
monster world.</p>
<p align="left">From that perspective, the treasure split should be as 
close to even as possible. Every character can benefit from treasure, 
provided that you offer a wide enough selection to interest everyone in 
the group.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Keep the Treasure Varied</b></p>
<p align="left">That last point, then, is the key issue -- make sure the
 treasure includes something for everyone at least most of the time. 
Lots of magic items are of universal value and therefore can benefit any
 character. Just because the monk and the psion aren't as interested in a
 <i>+3 flaming greatsword </i>as the fighter is doesn't mean they are any less interested in an<i> amulet of health +4. </i>If
 anything, the extra hit points and bonus on his Fortitude save are more
 important for the psion than the fighter, who is much less vulnerable 
on both counts. In like manner, items that boost spellcasting ability 
and increase bonus spells, power points, and save DCs are essential for 
maximizing the utility of a spellcaster or psionic character. And a 
canny psion who chooses his powers carefully could even roll around clad
 in full plate and shield. After all, armor does not interfere with 
psionics, and the nonproficiency penalty for the armor and shield is 
almost irrelevant if the psion rarely uses the affected skills or makes 
attack rolls. Thus, creative thinking might lead the psion to covet 
equipment that you might not expect.</p>
<p align="left">Likewise, a monk's basic class abilities are so 
melee-focused that she really needs a variety of miscellaneous items to 
round out her arsenal. She can make ready use of items that enhance her 
ranged attacks or grant her special movement. In addition, an item that 
would improve her unarmed fighting capabilities (such as an <i>amulet of mighty fists</i> or <i>bracers of striking</i>)
 would be most welcome, as would an item that would allow her to 
penetrate DR (such as weapons that are aligned or made of special 
materials). Furthermore, since a monk lacks the fighter's bevy of 
combat-focused feats, her unarmed damage may start to fall way behind if
 she can't find magical means to compensate. And it's much more 
expensive for a monk to boost her AC than it is for a fighter. Magic 
armor and shields are bargains compared to <i>bracers of armor, amulets of natural armor, rings of protection,</i> and the like. Viewed from this perspective, a monk might actually need more money than a fighter-type character. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Characters whose abilities don't depend on specific 
equipment can get by with less than other characters and still function.
 But if they want to excel, they have just as much need for loot and 
magic goodies as any other character does. So whether the treasure cones
 from plundering a monster lair, or as a reward for completing a 
mission, or from the dead body of a former party member, make sure 
everyone gets a fair share. Magic items found on dead NPCs or PCs are 
likely to be uniquely valuable to particular characters, but other PCs 
or cohorts can probably make good use of other specialty equipment the 
deceased may have had. Even though a party consisting of a druid, a 
wizard, and a rogue (as described in the companion post by Stembolt) 
probably wouldn't need the <i>+1 full plate</i> belonging to a defeated foe, the rogue might be able to put the <i>+2 spiked chain</i> to good use, depending on the character build. And anyone could use the <i>cloak of resistance, </i>the <i>boots of striding &amp; springing, </i>the <i>Heward's handy haversack, </i>the <i>belt of dwarvenkind, </i>the <i>gauntlets of ogre power,</i>
 and almost everything else the dead character had. Finally, the whole 
party can always benefit from throwing any unwanted items into the great
 loot-grinder in the nearest town and watching the gold pieces pour out!
