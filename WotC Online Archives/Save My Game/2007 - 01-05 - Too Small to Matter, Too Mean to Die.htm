<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Too Small to Matter</h4>
<p><i>In the MM2 under Jermlaine, it lists their damage as Diminutive 
dart1d3-4 and tiny shortspear 1d3-4. The -4 is obviously due to their 
low strength score. This calculates to negative damage which is 
illogical, and yet under their description it says "they will swarm 
[over an enemy], pummeling to cause subdual damage until the target is 
knocked out." How do I resolve damage when the enemy doesn't appear to 
be able to inflict any? Please help. This encounter happens tonight.</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Ja Mes, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>Thanks to the vagaries of time and space that come into play between 
you asking and me answering, this won't be much help to you for your 
game. Still, you bring up a good point -- sometimes the flavor text and 
suggested tactics in the monster books don't match up with what the 
monsters are actually able to do. I remember a particular demon whose 
flavor text suggested liked to hang back and pepper its enemies with 
ranged attacks, but when you looked at the monster's abilities, very few
 were ranged attacks. It was a killer in melee, but the flavor text and 
the powers didn't match. Just consider that a pick in <i>D&amp;D</i> 
(yes, it's a military pick, but work with me here) is incapable of 
damaging stone -- it can't do enough damage to overcome the hardness of 
stone. It's easier to go mining in <i>D&amp;D </i>with greatswords and power-attacking barbarians than it is to mine with a pick. What the heck?</p>
<p>The root of your question lies in two problems. One is with editing. <i>Monster Manual II</i> had a few troublesome issues, and the jermlaine entry is no exception (see the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/er/20040125a">errata page</a>
 for full details). Take, for instance, the weapon damage under 
discussion. The tiny jermlaine uses a diminutive dart. A small-sized 
dart does 1d3 damage; a diminutive one (two sizes smaller) should do 
only 1 damage, plus strength modifier (-4).</p>
<p>Before you get an answer, though, you also suffer a cross-edition breakdown. <i>Monster Manual II</i>
 was a book designed for the 3rd Edition ("3.0") rule set, and that 
shows up here. Because of the way weapons were classified in that 
version, a dart was a 'small' weapon relative to its wielder's size, 
whereas it is now a 'light' missile weapon. Therefore, a tiny wielder 
would use a tiny dart, which would be a tiny light weapon (doing 1d2-4) 
rather than a diminutive weapon (doing 1-4).</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="left"><i>Producer's Note</i>: As folks have pointed out, 
according to the SRD jermlaine fall into the category of minimum damage:
 If penalties reduce the damage result to less than 1, a hit still deals
 1 point of damage. Scoring less than 0 hp wouldn't actually heal a 
character, after all. That said, introducing jermlaine swarms and other 
strategies are effective ways of making these pesky threats a little 
more threatening.</p>

 all of that is a fascinating dissection on the fine points of rule 
translation from edition to edition, the more important refinement in 
3.5 that can help the jermlaine is the introduction of the swarm 
template for dealing with lots of tiny creatures. When it states that 
jermlaines swarm over enemies and pummel them, why not go ahead and 
apply the swarm template? The fact that each individual jermlaine is too
 wimpy to be dangerous is irrelevant when dozens of them are swarming 
over a person.</p>
<p>Jermlaines are different from a typical swarm in that most swarms are
 mindless vermin (like rats, a jermlaine's best -- and only -- friends).
 Our jermlaines, while not too smart, are certainly canny enough to use 
weapons. Can swarms throw darts at people? It creates an interesting 
problem. The swarm template works fine when you are dealing with things 
that just bite and sting, but would a jermlaine swarm be shooting off 
clouds of darts and tiny javelins? If so, how far does the ranged attack
 go? Who does it affect? Does it distract people the way the melee 
attack does? The swarm template just became more complicated. The mob 
template in <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i> is better set up for 
dealing with groups of intelligent creatures, but we don't want to deal 
with thousands of jermlaine in a 20' x 20' gargantuan mass, and the hit 
dice and damage of a mob is too much for jermlaine.</p>
<p>Finally, jermlaine should not only be represented as swarms. No one 
cares that a single toad or weasel is incapable of inflicting harm. 
Those exist in the game to be pets or familiars. The jermlaine, though, 
is supposed to be a monster -- a threat of some sort. An individual 
jermlaine can be a threat by setting off traps, dropping acid or flaming
 oil, and the like. It also can steal and vandalize items on its own, or
 use darts that have been poisoned or tainted with filth so as to cause 
disease (probably filth fever). Even if their darts don't cause any hit 
point loss, they can wear adventurers down through ability damage.</p>
<p>So what's the answer to your question? Throwing jermlaine one-on-one 
against PCs is pointless. They can't do damage unless you change the 
rules. You can do several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arm jermlaine with items that cause specialized damage -- flaming 
oil, acid, contact poison, tanglefoot bag, thunderstone, and the like. 
Strength is irrelevant, so they can use their attack bonuses for tiny 
size and good Dexterity to hit. When they throw tiny darts or spears, 
make sure they are poisoned or tainted with disease.</li>
<li>Make liberal use of traps, as the flavor text suggests. Think about 
both damaging traps and immobilizing traps that enable jermlaine to use 
their small size and good speed to hit and run.</li>
<li>In terms of swarming and pummeling, use the swarm template from <i>Monster Manual</i> or the mob template from <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i>,
 depending on how many jermlaine you're talking about. You might even 
fudge the rules a bit to make a 'micro-swarm' of jermlaine, say 30-50 
that swarm into a single 5' square (instead of a shapeable swarm of 300 
in four 5' squares). If you want to keep things easy, just use the stats
 for a rat swarm on p. 239 of the <i>Monster Manual</i>. A rat and a 
jermlaine are pretty similar in their abilities. If you like, assume 
that jermlaine cause nonlethal rather than lethal damage.</li>
<li>Combine these strategies. Some jermlaine can be individual scouts, 
thieves, vandals, distractions, trap operators, and missile-tossing 
skirmishers. Others can be mass attackers.</li>
<li>Hey, jermlaine love rats, so combine them with individual dire rats 
(perhaps as mounts for jermlaine leaders) or rat swarms overlapping with
 the jermlaine swarms. Swarms can, after all, occupy the same space as 
other creatures. Perhaps the jermlaines' empathic connection with rats 
and ability to communicate with them will enable them to coordinate 
mutual swarm attacks (not attacking one another, of course).</li>
</ol>
<p>When using tiny creatures, you need to be creative. Try some of these
 tricks and it may help. Failing that, you could always resurrect the 
old 1st Edition <i>AD&amp;D</i> rule that certain elder jermlaine had 
the ability to disenchant magic items just by handling them for a few 
rounds. That might put a scare in your players even if they never take a
 point of damage!</p>
