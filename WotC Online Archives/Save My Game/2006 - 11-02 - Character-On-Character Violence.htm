<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Character-on-Character Violence</h4>
<p><i>I see nothing prohibiting this or allowing it but always played 
that it is possible to attack a party member (dispute, evil motives, 
whatever reason). Is there an official stance on this?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- David, from AskWizards</p>
<p>You've hit upon the "official" stance exactly: There is nothing 
prohibiting or allowing party members from attacking one another (I 
assume you are talking about intentionally attacking one another rather 
than being <i>charmed</i> or <i>dominated</i> to do so). It is entirely 
up to the DM and the players involved as to what they want to do. This 
isn't a computer game where actions are limited by what the program 
allows. <i>D&amp;D</i> is about people running characters and having them act however they choose.</p>
<p>That said, my 'official' position is that, as a general rule, player 
vs. player combat is dumb. Here's why -- Part of the fun of playing <i>D&amp;D</i>
 is accomplishing mighty deeds and epic quests. Those are best 
accomplished by the party working as a team. In that regard, player vs. 
player combat is counter-productive. You waste your resources fighting 
one another.</p>
<p>Some will say it's 'realistic' for individual PCs to be 
self-interested. Sure, but self-interested to the point of endangering 
the mission? And self-interested to the point of endangering the 
self-interest of the other characters as well? If someone has shown that
 they put themselves ahead of both group goals and even the bare minimum
 of mutual respect, what is the basis for continuing to adventure 
together? Why would you trust that person? Adventuring is a dangerous 
business, and you are putting your life in the hands of others in the 
hope and expectation that they will prove themselves worthy of your 
trust. If someone attacks you, you will fight back. Even if both of you 
survive, the relationship is broken.</p>
<p>This personality does not play well with others. It works fine for 
James Bond, because he's the main character, a solo act. The other 
people around him are secondary characters who help or hinder him. It 
also works fine for the 'epic betrayal' in a novel -- consider Raistlin 
in <i>Dragonlance</i>. But at that point, the PC who turns on the rest of the party suddenly becomes an NPC, and now we're not playing a <i>D&amp;D</i> campaign any more. We are either playing two <i>D&amp;D</i>
 campaigns, with some of the players doing one thing and some doing 
another, or we retire one or more characters and start fresh.</p>
<p>So my answer is, there is nothing in the rules preventing PCs from attacking one another. Only common sense.</p>
<p><i>I have started DMing a game for the local college students. All of
 the people get along and are friends. But when they get together to 
adventure, they argue. The alignments are NG, CG, TN. There are no true 
leader types in the group. Races are human (cleric, thief, fighter), 
gray elf (soon to be bard), wild elf (ranger), half-minotaur (fighter), 
wood elf (ranger, wizard, fighter), halfling (thief), gnome 
(illusionist), and we just picked up a half-orc (fighter). We are going 
to pick up a half-elf (wizard/cleric). The half-orc and half-elf are 
newbies to our game but have played before. No one is a strong enough 
leader as a PC or player. How do I get around this or keep them from 
arguing so much?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Greg</p>
<p>There are no classes or races that necessarily create or solve 
arguments, though characters of radically different races and alignments
 obviously have the potential to cause problems. Players of high 
Charisma characters such as bards or paladins may be prone to take the 
lead and try to be leaders, but it sounds as if no one in your group 
(even the bard-to-be) is doing that. </p>
<p>It sounds as if your problem is not too many people with a strong 
personality but too few. You might think about encouraging players to be
 more assertive, because it sounds like no one is doing more than 
suggesting options, meaning you end up with analysis paralysis and just 
keep knocking things around the table instead of choosing one and doing 
it.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing says your group has to get along peaceably or that
 characters and players shouldn't argue, other than common sense and 
time management. Maybe that's where you should start the discussion. 
Point out that, in real-life terms, you only have a limited amount of 
time for gaming, and it would be fun to be able to actually play during 
the time that you have together. Speaking for yourself, you do not enjoy
 the constant bickering and arguing, and you would rather the game focus
 on other things. If you want to be methodical, you could track the 
amount of time spent arguing in the next game session -- don't tell the 
players, just measure it and see what it adds up to. Then, the next 
session, show them exactly how much game time was wasted on arguing. </p>
<p>Be prepared to get the argument that it is 'realistic' for PCs to 
argue all the time. Sure, people do argue, and we've all read books or 
watched movies where much of the fun is in the arguing and byplay 
between the characters. What works fine on the page or on the screen, 
though, doesn't necessarily translate to the tabletop. In the script or 
in the dialogue, arguments are self-limited, a quick diversion from the 
main thrust of the narrative. They come and they go, and the story moves
 on. In <i>D&amp;D</i>, you have real people making arguments, and they 
can't just be swayed or satisfied after a page and a half of dialogue. 
Arguments take on a life of their own, and they tend to grow and involve
 more than just the original two people. Some arguments are legitimate, 
but even those get to be a drag if it seems that everything ends up in 
an argument -- rules questions, who should get to Spot or Listen, what 
information is shared, and so on.</p>
<p>A simple solution is to keep a three-minute egg timer at the table. 
When an argument crops up, announce that the timer is on, and whatever 
arguing needs to happen needs to be done quickly and efficiently. When 
the timer runs out, the argument ends, and you as the DM make a 
decision. People whose concerns are not addressed in that time can bring
 them up after the session or by phone or email between sessions. </p>
<p>It's not that concerns aren't important; it's that your group needs 
to learn some discipline about the process of resolving conflict. They 
need to learn to make points quickly and clearly, allow the other side 
to do the same, and then be willing to accept the DM's resolution. They 
can appeal it later, but in the middle of the game, they need to just 
accept it and keep the game moving. That's much better than getting 
bogged down in the back-and-forth of the argument.</p>
