 campaign having some troubles? Do your players constantly bicker or 
complain about issues both inside and outside of the main campaign 
action? Do your best ideas fall flat? Have you set up a situation that 
you now wish you hadn't? This week we discuss treasure -- everybody 
wants it, but players often think their characters aren't getting 
enough. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Poverty-Stricken PCs</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>My DM is cheap when it comes to passing out treasure. When I compare the Typical Character Wealth entry on page 135 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 with what's on my character sheet, I can see right away that my 
treasure total falls far short of the goal. Even worse, my character 
seems poor in comparison with the rest of his party. I think the DM 
plays favorites, giving the best items to other people. How can my 
character get his fair share of the rewards in our game? -- Jim</b></p>
<p align="left">Jim's problem is a fairly common one. Every game is 
different, and each campaign has a different balance point with regard 
to treasure. But if a player truly feels cheated, you need to address 
the issue, because players who think they aren't getting their fair 
share of the game's rewards tend to drop out. Let's look at three 
potential solutions for Jim's problem.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Communication</b></p>
<p align="left">If others feel the way Jim does, then the whole group --
 DM and players -- needs to sit down together and have a candid 
conversation about treasure in the campaign. How far apart are the DM 
and the players with regard to how much loot is available, and what 
style of play are they accustomed to? Does the DM tend to be 
conservative with treasure when the players are used to a Monty Haul 
style of game? Or is the DM throwing out <i>+5 longswords</i> like candy
 corn to PCs whose players are used to making do? During this 
discussion, the group should try to find some common ground regarding 
the amount of treasure that's appropriate for the kinds of challenges 
the PCs face.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Treasure Placement</b></p>
<p align="left">Jim's problem probably stems from a difference of 
opinion over the right amount of treasure, but a similar situation can 
also arise from misunderstandings regarding treasure placement. 
Differences in the way treasure is organized from one campaign to 
another can create confusion and even alter the way people play the 
game. The crux of the problem is that some DMs place treasure in every 
encounter, and others don't.</p>
<p align="left">In the former kind of game, even PCs who kill a bear in 
the woods can still track the creature back to its cave and find some 
loot there, mixed in with the gnawed bones and rubbish. Maybe not every 
animal or bug or slime has treasure in this kind of arrangement, but 
almost any kind of "monster" does possess one or more items of value. 
This model has the advantage of fairness, and it ensures that treasure 
is spread out fairly evenly over the course of an adventure. However, 
the placement may sometimes seem less than logical.</p>
<p align="left">In the second case, the DM distributes treasure 
unevenly, often placing more at the end of a given adventure than at the
 beginning. This model has the advantage of better logic -- guards, 
minions, and incidental monsters may be challenging, but they tend to 
possess little more than their own personal gear. Most of the loot is in
 the hands of the main monster or mastermind, who keeps the best items 
for her own use and hoards coins with which to support her minions. In 
this latter respect, she bears a strong resemblance to a boss guarding 
the company payroll.</p>
<p align="left">If players who are used to games of the former sort 
start an adventure of the latter kind, they may quickly decide that the 
scenario isn't worth finishing because they have found no treasure. In 
fact, such players often repeat the same process over and over, starting
 any number of adventures and abandoning them before they find the main 
treasure. This kind of behavior can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: 
The PCs don't find any treasure, so they quit looking, thereby negating 
their chances of finding any in the future. This behavior is logical 
enough -- experience tells them no treasure exists, so why should they 
keep looking? In this kind of situation, the players are frustrated 
because they find nothing of value, and the DM is frustrated because the
 PCs never finish any adventures or find any of the treasure that she 
has placed for them. </p>
<p align="left">Again, the solution here is communication. The players 
and DM should talk about placement of treasure and the way the DM 
prefers to organize adventures. If the players realize that they 
shouldn't stop looking for treasure, they'll learn not to quit so 
easily.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Accounting</b></p>
<p align="left">The forms in which wealth is distributed may be quite 
different from one campaign to another. For example, one DM might give 
out lots of low-value items plus a few high-ticket pieces, and another 
might limit the number of permanent items but hand out lots of 
disposable ones, such as wands and scrolls. Still another DM might award
 lots of magic but little cash, or vice versa. All of these techniques 
can end up making players think their characters are poor even when the 
aggregate numbers don't support that theory.</p>
<p align="left">Keeping a tally of treasure gained can help a player 
figure out whether his character is really poor or not, in either 
absolute or relative terms. </p>
<p align="left">To apply this solution to your campaign, just conduct a 
wealth audit for each character. Everyone can add up the value of his 
character's possessions, including all money, magic, gems, jewelry, and 
any other valuables or property he might possess. The characters in a 
party need not all have the exact same gp value of treasure -- 
variations are to be expected based on attendance, luck with treasure 
division, attrition of items, and the like. In addition, a few 
characters might be temporarily out of balance with the rest of the 
party because they possess high-value items for which the rest of the 
party cannot compensate via division of lower-value items. Such 
inequities should, however, balance out over time as other characters 
accumulate higher-value items of their own. If one player is receiving a
 disproportionate share of treasure, the DM should address that 
situation by making more items available that are useful to other 
characters until the situation is resolved.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">If someone in your group feels slighted on treasure, 
find out if the problem is one of perception or communication. In either
 case, conversation may be enough to resolve the issue. If not, tally 
each character's possessions and compare the totals. Discuss whether the
 average party wealth is appropriate for the campaign, both in absolute 
terms and relative to the campaign's wealth level. Then check to see 
whether one or two characters have been receiving a disproportionate 
amount of treasure and try to balance future treasure awards. In the 
end, the players and the DM must all be flexible enough to adjust their 
expectations and find a comfortable level of reward for the challenges 
of the campaign.</p>
