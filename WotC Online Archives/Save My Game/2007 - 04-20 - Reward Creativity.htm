<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Encouraging Creativity</h4>
<p><i>I have a problem with the horribly uncreative players that are my 
friends. I DM a game with four other people playing. I figure their 
classes are irrelevant, but we have a cleric, a bard, a wizard, and a 
barbarian. I figure that's enough spread to be creative in terms of 
problem solving. For example, the cliche of opening a locked door is to 
pull a book out or remove a torch. I made it so they had to turn a 
brazier in the corner of the room. It took them one real hour to figure 
it out, after me hinting at it! How can I breed creativity (at least a 
little) in them?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Roger, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20070413">Last time</a>,
 I addressed Roger's question it was pretty much to tell him that he was
 asking the wrong question entirely and that he needed to reorient his 
thinking about the challenges he created. They need to be more relevant 
to the characters' abilities and less to the players having to guess 
what he was thinking. His question, however, does have some merit. How <i>do</i> you make players become more creative? </p>
<p>That's a tough question, because creativity is in the eye of the 
beholder. What one person calls creative another person calls random. 
Consider the example above -- is it creative to guess that moving books 
or furniture is going to open doors? Maybe, or maybe it's just the 
patience to push, pull, prod, tap, and wiggle every single thing in the 
room until something happens. Maybe it's desperate frustration, touching
 everything and hoping for the best. Reaching the proper solution to 
Roger's brazier-door could come from creativity, tenacity, or just dumb 
luck. </p>
<p>The ultimate answer to how you breed creativity is by cultivating the ground for creativity to grow. </p>
<p><b>Talk about Metagame Assumptions</b></p>
<p>Roger has a metagame assumption -- the idea that moving furniture or 
books will trigger a door -- and he designed his challenge in part based
 on that metagame knowledge as well as his assumption that the players 
share this knowledge and are willing to access it as part of their <i>D&amp;D</i>
 gameplay. That is a long string of assumptions. If any one of them 
breaks down, then the players will not guess the secret, at least not as
 a result of their metagaming. </p>
<p>Did the players see the same movies or read the same stories as you? 
Did they focus on and remember the same details about shifting furniture
 and secret doors? Do they have some logical reason to access that 
information about a memory of a story or movie and connect it to what is
 happening in the <i>D&amp;D</i> game? Even if all of the above happens 
without a hitch, do they want to play off that knowledge? Their 
character has never seen that movie or read that story, or their 
character might be dumb as a rock or a savage barbarian to whom doors 
are a strange affectation, much less hidden and trick-trigger doors. </p>
<p>I say all this to make it clear that you need to talk to your players
 about the kinds of inspiration you take for your campaign. Talk about 
movies and books and other media that influence why you game and the 
style of adventure you like. Talk about past campaigns. I'm not asking 
you to spill your whole bag of tricks, but if you want players to play 
off of their personal knowledge, you need to give them some clue of what
 kinds of things are likely to come into play. If you are running a <i>Ravenloft </i>campaign
 inspired by your love of old horror and monster movies, they probably 
would think about that and the tropes of that genre when confronted by a
 player-knowledge puzzle such as this. If you are running a high-fantasy
 <i>Forgotten Realms </i>game, that assumption becomes less likely. </p>
<p>Heck, talk about adventures you ran in the past which influenced you 
and the kinds of challenges you like to work into the campaign. If you 
tell them that, in your game, they need to look in unexpected places to 
find things, talk first and kill later, and so on, then they will be 
able to act on that knowledge and everyone will have more fun. You are 
still making them play "guess what the DM is thinking," but at least you
 game them some insight and clues into what that might be. </p>
<p><b>Be Creative Yourself, and Leave Room for Creativity</b></p>
<p>Roger, your players ultimately could not be creative in solving your 
challenge because your challenge was not creative. Not because it was a 
trick door -- that's fine -- but it was a trick door with only one 
solution. You created a point in the adventure that could be solved only
 one way -- yours. You need to design challenges in a way that accounts 
for different ways of getting past. Think of what skills, spells, feats,
 or ideas a player might be able to use to circumvent the barrier. Put 
yourself in the players' shoes, and see how creative you can be. Until 
you do, you have little reason to complain about the players being 
uncreative when they are just giving back to you what you gave them. </p>
<p><b>Reward Creativity</b></p>
<p>This is probably the most important part. Let me use a spell example --</p>
<p>Why does <i>magic missile </i>get cast ten times as often as <i>charm person </i>or <i>silent image </i>(I'm using hyperbole to make a point, so don't bother quibbling over the numbers)? Because <i>it always works</i>, that's why. You can't go wrong with good ol' <i>magic missile</i>. <i>Charm person</i>?
 Well, your request wasn't reasonable, so new saving throw; or you can't
 speak their language, or they're just your friend and not your slave, 
so they won't do what you want. <i>Silent image</i>? Well, it's 
unrealistic, so they get a save bonus, or their friend saw through it, 
or whatever. Many players of spellcasters don't bother casting spells 
that require creativity because DMs rob them rather than reward them 
when they try to be creative. The DM comes up with all kinds of reasons 
why the spell must adhere to a strictly limited effect. I'm not saying 
that 1st-level (or any level) enchantments and illusions should be 
all-powerful and able to do anything, or that you shouldn't be wary of 
overly clever players trying to exploit loopholes or push beyond what 
should be possible -- but if you want creativity, you need to reward it.
 </p>
<p>'Reward' also means 'don't punish' the players. Let's say you've 
established that in your campaign, PCs will often need to search in 
unusual spots if they hope to find anything of importance. Let's say 
further that you then riddle those areas with traps and ambushes. What's
 more, every NPC the characters talk to lies to them or betrays them. 
Players are smart. They will quickly learn that you are messing with 
them and that they are better off ignoring those 'creative' outlets, 
because nine times out of ten they lead to trouble and pain. <i>Sometimes</i> those situations should hide traps, but not <i>every time</i>.</p>
<p>When it comes to rewards, remember that you should give out xp for 
characters avoiding encounters as well as bashing through them, or 
coming up with creative ideas for combat rather than just 
I-hit-you/you-hit-me slugfests until somebody drops, and for teamwork 
and coordination when overcoming obstacles or challenges. The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>describes
 assigning CR to traps, but why not also to puzzles, tricks, and 
challenges that don't pose an immediate threat to life and limb? The 
same goes for obstacles that can be overcome with skills and wits or 
judicious use of party resources rather than brute force. You could 
establish ad hoc xp awards for the group for overcoming your challenges 
(or even to individual players with the 'best' ideas, though there is a 
danger of appearing to play favorites here). These are player-centered 
challenges, and the level of the characters ultimately has little to do 
with it. The player of a 1st-level commoner can be just as clever and 
creative as a 20th-level warlord, and that needs to be recognized. </p>
<p>However you do it, make it worth your players' while to venture off 
the beaten path. Not just in game mechanics, but in real 
accomplishments. A reward that requires real work by the <i>players </i>should result in a real benefit for the <i>players</i>
 -- finding a substantial reward, avoiding a significant danger, 
achieving a meaningful goal. If it's just the door to the next hallway, 
what a come-down. Creativity can be its own reward, but to breed or 
cultivate it, you need to sweeten the pot to get things moving.</p>
