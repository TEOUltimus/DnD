<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>So Your Kids Want to Play. . . .</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> This installment of <i>Save My Game</i> examines how to structure <b>D&amp;D</b>
 games for children. What's a DM to do when young players come to the 
table eager for action but with limited attention spans and no knowledge
 of the game?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Problem: Running Games for Kids</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>I have the interesting challenge of DMing for a group
 of children, ages 10, 11, and 13. I would appreciate any advice on how 
to manage such a group, as well as how to escape the cliché game.</i>-<b>Adapted from a post by</b><b>MomtheDungeonMaster on the Wizards of the Coast message boards</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Hey, training the next generation of <b>D&amp;D</b> 
players is an important part of the hobby. I started playing when I was 
10 years old just because the fantasy element interested me, and I think
 a lot of folks who began in the late 70s and early 80s took up the game
 for the same reasons. Nowadays, though, fantasy themes abound in 
popular movies, novels, and computer games, so tweens and teens who 
might once have been sitting around the school library watching other 
kids play <b>D&amp;D</b> may now be hitting the internet to play World 
of Warcraft. So for starters, congratulations for taking on the 
challenge of sharing <b>D&amp;D</b> with the younger set!</p>
<p align="LEFT">Running games for kids definitely is a challenge, 
though. For a player who's new to your game but has played before, 
fitting in may be just a matter of learning your style, but the learning
 curve is much steeper for someone who's never played before. And if 
those new players are kids, they may be terribly intimidated and 
confused by the barrage of new words, the rapid-fire arithmetic, and the
 amount of reading that seems to be required.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 1: Be Patient</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Though age and maturity don't always go hand in hand, 
kids do tend to react differently than adults. Even kids of the same age
 may differ in how long they can sit still, what parts of the game they 
enjoy, how much background reading they want to do, and so on. In my 
underage group (namely, my three kids), the player who has read all the 
books is the most gung-ho about gaming. The other two also enjoy 
playing, but they prefer to discover what the game has to offer in their
 own ways.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you have an "expert" in your game, be especially 
careful to avoid letting her boss the others around or tell them what to
 do. Your know-it-all may be giving good advice, but the other players 
probably don't want someone else playing their characters for them, even
 if that person would make fewer mistakes. It's okay to let your expert 
help someone who has a rules question or needs to find a piece of 
information in a book, but make sure she maintains a helper's attitude. 
The same advice also goes for you as DM-it's fine to provide help when 
asked, but let the players play their characters and make their own 
mistakes. Just be ready to take breaks to explain what went wrong for 
the characters and why.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Most importantly, don't try to pack too much into a game
 session when you run for kids. Playing too long puts a strain on them 
and on you, and that kind of stress can cause gamers of any age to snap 
at each other, become frustrated or bored, and just generally stop 
having fun. Two hours is probably about the longest nonstop session you 
should plan. If you want to play longer, take a break from the action 
when you reach a good stopping place, then come back to the game-maybe 
later the same day if your players are really excited, or maybe the 
following week. When you resume, check to see what everyone remembers 
from last time and refresh their memories if needed, before starting up 
again.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 2: Start with the Basics</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Although playing is truly the best way to learn the 
D&amp;D game, green players do need at least a basic tutorial in game 
concepts and ideas. So talk first about races, classes, and ability 
scores, explaining briefly what those terms mean. Ask your players to 
think about what kind of character sounds interesting to them, and why 
such a hero would go adventuring. You don't really need the answers to 
those questions, but thinking about them helps players get an idea what 
their characters would really be like.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since the game is <b>D&amp;D,</b> combat must enter the 
conversation at some point. If you have a miniatures game or a battle 
mat, explaining combat becomes much easier because the kids can see 
where their markers are and visualize the concepts. Using such aids also
 resolves a lot of arguments about who did what and where everyone was. 
And if you show your players examples of tactical movement on the board,
 abstract rules such as attacks of opportunity can be made clear in a 
remarkably short time.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The first and most important combat rule for kids is 
initiative. It's a simple rule, but making it clear and enforcing it can
 save you a lot of headaches because it helps the kids learn to take 
turns. By always taking actions in initiative order, you can organize 
the chaotic cries of "I do this" and "I do that" into an orderly, sane 
procedure. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Next, combine characters and combat by talking about 
Armor Class, hit points, saving throws, weapons, and armor. For 
starters, describe the basic equipment. You can use the sample PCs from 
the <i>Player's Handbook,</i> or just talk with each player about some 
of the options he has for equipping his character. Buying other 
equipment is probably not all that important in actual play, but 
thinking about the sorts of items a character might want for exploring 
the unknown can be a fun exercise. You can roleplay the shopping trip if
 you wish, but watch for signs of boredom. If you see any, summarize the
 purchases and move on to the game's main action.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 3: Build up the Complexity as You Play</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Don't just start simple and stay simple. As new 
situations arise, you can gradually bring in more of the game's rules to
 cover them. If you like, you can discuss skills and feats during your 
tutorial, or you could deal with them as they come up in the game. For 
example, you could arrange practice situations, such as archery or 
jousting tournaments at a local festival, that allow characters to 
practice using their feats. Or you could let them make Climb, Jump, 
Swim, or Ride checks in a race or athletic competition, or Spot checks 
when a thief tries to pick their pockets, or Sense Motive checks to 
guess when someone is trying to swindle them.</p>
<p align="LEFT">As you play, let the game come to you. The first time 
the PCs meet a crocodile while crossing a river, they learn about water 
combat and grappling. The first time a goblin uses its whip against 
them, they learn about tripping. When they encounter the vampire moss of
 the Black Swamp, they learn about ability damage. Just keep adding a 
piece here and a piece there, and let your players learn as they go. You
 could deal with multiclassing opportunities when the characters hit 2nd
 level, or you might just decide that for the first campaign, all the 
characters must be single-classed, at least for the first couple of 
levels. As the players gradually become more familiar with the rules, 
the basics will become almost automatic, and they can think more about 
their characters and what they want to do with them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 4: What's the Matter with Clichés Anyway?</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> I'm not sure that avoiding clichés is a good idea with a
 group of youngsters. After all, the clichés and tropes of the fantasy 
genre may be exactly what your kids want. What kid wouldn't want to be 
the knight who saves the town, or the dashing rogue who steals the crown
 jewels-or even the prince's heart? Kids don't need gritty realism from 
day one, so clichés or not, simple stories and plots are best ones to 
start with. As play continues, you can plan adventures with different 
themes-one lighthearted, one creepy, one involving underground travel, 
one featuring a sea voyage, one in the elven woods, one in the slums and
 sewers of the city, and so forth. Let the PCs explore the world while 
their players explore the gaming experience. In some encounters, the 
character may have to fight the bad guys, while in others they may have 
to talk with NPCs. Some adventures may depend on figuring out a puzzle 
or mystery, others might involve urgent missions, and still others might
 just take the encounters as they come. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A simple way to start the first few adventures is to 
give the PCs a job to do. Have an NPC hire them to fetch some stolen 
goods, or to guard a caravan as it makes its way through a 
bandit-infested forest. Most adventures should be straightforward, 
especially in the early part of the campaign, so that the players have a
 foundation on which to build their perception of the game's "reality." 
Later on, you can always add a plot twist if you like. For example, 
perhaps the person who hired the party to fetch the stolen goods 
actually stole them herself, or maybe the bandits in the forest are the 
rightful owners of that land! The plot twists you use for kids should be
 fairly simple and obvious, though you can offer clues that build on 
each other-for example, the PCs could find pieces of a map or key. (This
 technique gives you a perfect chance to use visual aids and 
manipulatives, which is a great way to maintain the interest of 
youngsters!) But don't overdo the tricks and plot twists, or your 
players will always be expecting one, and they may start to lose their 
understanding of the baseline campaign world. Give your young gamers a 
chance to figure out a mystery, and they'll develop the feeling of 
accomplishment that comes with doing so. Maybe one day, they'll even 
begin to write their own stories!</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The best way to learn the <b>D&amp;D</b> game is by 
playing it, but beginners still need at least a minimal tutorial. If 
your players are kids, keep the explanations brief and focused on what 
they need to know to decide what characters to play. Thereafter, 
introduce rules slowly as they play, and don't let one player who has 
read the books dictate actions to others. Keep your game sessions short 
and your adventures simple, at least in the early stages. Vary the 
settings to offer variety and teach your players about different parts 
of the campaign world, and create adventures that require them to use 
different character abilities. You can add plot twists if you like, but 
don't do so too often or make them too complex. And clichés aren't so 
terrible that they must be avoided at all costs, especially for 
youngsters who have not yet had the opportunity to become jaded by 
overexposure to classic fantasy tales.</p>
