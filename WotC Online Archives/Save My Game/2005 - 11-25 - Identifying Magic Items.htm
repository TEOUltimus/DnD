<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas

Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Believable Magic Item Identification</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-25%20-%20Identifying%20Magic%20Items_files/sg_20050311a_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="170" width="307">What's
 a DM to do when the PCs constantly put the game on hold until they can 
have all their new magic items identified? This installment of <i>Save My Game</i>
 examines ways to make in-game identification of magic items convenient 
enough that PCs won't wait for their next visit to town to divvy up and 
try out their treasures. </p>
<p align="left">Problem: "You Find a +<i>1 Sword</i>. . . ."</p>
<p align="left"><i>What can be done about the disconnect between DM and 
players when it comes to identifying treasure? As DM, you know exactly 
what a magic item does, but how can you convey this information to 
players (or teach them how to make the right investigations) within the 
context of the game? -- </i><b>Monty B. from Wizards of the Coast</b></p>
<p align="left"> Identifying magic has always caused DMs to hem and haw 
between "realism" and convenience. On one hand, the game becomes a lot 
simpler if PCs can identify items more or less immediately, primarily 
because they don't feel the need to wait until they go back to town to 
try out their finds. Furthermore, such knowledge tends to make treasure 
division a lot easier, especially if not everyone in your group plays 
every session (as is the case with most groups). If magic items are 
found one week and not identified until three weeks later, numerous 
issues can crop up to delay final disbursement. The players may want to 
establish who was there for the session during which the item was found,
 which characters who were not present should get a share anyway, and 
who will remember to tell/call/email Mike and Sully about the items 
their characters got. Perhaps treasure division shouldn't be that 
difficult to sort out, but it usually is.</p>
<p align="left">At the same time, it seems a little silly for PCs to 
just instantly recognize every item they come across, as if it had a 
label and a list of contents. So let's look at a few ways that you might
 balance the realism and the convenience factors.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: What Problem?</b></p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="240"><tbody><tr><td>
<p align="left"><b>Analyze Dweomer (Brd 6, Sor/Wiz 6):</b> You discern 
all spells and magical properties present in a number of creatures or 
objects. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that 
you can see as a free action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its
 functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many
 charges are left (if it has charges). In the case of an object or 
creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its 
effect, and its caster level.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Identify (Brd 1, Magic 2, Sor/Wiz 1): </b>The spell 
determines all magic properties of a single magic item, including , how 
to activate those functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are 
left (if any).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">The endlessly useful spells <i>identify</i> and <i>analyze dweomer</i> are readily available to arcane casters. However, a few issues prevent their regular use during game sessions.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Identify</i> costs money -- a lot of money, 
relatively speaking, for low-level adventurers (100 gp). More 
importantly, it takes an entire hour to cast. <i>Analyze dweomer</i> can be used on multiple items simultaneously and is quick to cast, but also costs a 1500 gp gemstone to cast. Furthermore, <i>analyze dweomer</i>
 is a 6th-level spell, so gaining access to it can be both difficult and
 expensive -- after all, not all towns have 11th-level wizards for hire.
 A higher-level PC wizard could carry it around prepared, but doing so 
requires sacrificing a high-level spell. PCs could also purchase it on a
 scroll, but the party must have a caster capable of using it to make 
such an investment pay off.</p>
<p align="left">Despite these issues, both <i>identify</i> and <i>analyze dweomer </i>are
 useful in-game ways to let PCs discover what magic items they have 
found. If these options are fine with you, then you can ignore the rest 
of this column. If you would like some other alternatives, read on.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Spellcraft</b></p>
<p align="left">The Spellcraft skill already allows characters to 
identify potions (DC 25) and scroll spells (DC 20 + spell level), so why
 not broaden it to include other magic items as well? Using Spellcraft, a
 character can identify a scroll in 1 round or a potion in 1 minute. You
 as DM must decide the time required for any other item, but most if not
 all should fall into one of those two timeframes. If you want to make 
it simple, just rule that a scroll takes 1 round and any other item 
takes 1 minute. That way, characters still can't identify most items in 
the middle of a battle, but they can do so as soon as the battle is over
 and then move on.</p>
<p align="left">As a guide to setting Spellcraft DCs, you could use the 
prerequisite level for the relevant item creation feat. Potions (based 
on Brew Potion, minimum caster level 3rd) are DC 25 and scrolls (based 
on Scribe Scroll, minimum caster level 1st) begin at DC 20. By that 
logic, arms and armor and wands (minimum caster level 5th) should be DC 
30, rods (minimum caster level 9th) should be DC 35, and rings and 
staffs (minimum caster level 12th) should be DC 40. Wondrous items 
(minimum caster level 3rd) should be relatively easy to identify (DC 25,
 the same as potions), but I suggest setting the DC at 25 for minor 
wondrous items, 30 for medium items, and 40 for major items. </p>
<p align="left">If you want to make identifying magic purely a Spellcraft-based mechanic, you could change the <i>identify</i> and <i>analyze dweomer</i>
 spells so that instead of just identifying items, they provide bonuses 
to the caster's Spellcraft checks for identifying magic. Perhaps <i>identify</i> gives a +20 bonus on one check, and <i>analyze dweomer </i>gives
 a +20 bonus on every check made for the duration of the spell. You 
might also think about giving a character with the relevant item 
creation feat a +2 circumstance bonus (if not more) on checks to 
identify magic. That technique gives a character with Craft Wands a 
better chance to identify a wand than someone without the feat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Appraise</b></p>
<p align="left">Okay, the Appraise skill may seem like an odd choice of 
mechanics for identifying magic, though obviously it makes sense for 
assessing the sale value of magic items already identified. However, you
 could establish a house rule that rogues (and perhaps bards as well) 
can use Appraise to identify magic items in the same way as a 
spellcaster would use Spellcraft. You could either make it a class 
ability (like a rogue's trapfinding), or add it to the list of bonus 
special abilities from which rogues can choose beginning at 10th level. </p>
<p align="left">If you didn't want to restrict the mechanic to rogues 
and bards, you could just make the ability a feat that any character can
 take. The Appraise Magic Value feat in <i>Complete Adventurer</i> 
accomplishes the same purpose, though it takes 8 hours to use and costs 
money each time. If you're looking for a quick identification method 
based on the Spellcraft mechanic, try the following version.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Appraise Magic [General]</b></p>
<p align="left">You are skilled at evaluating magic items and discovering their secrets.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Appraise 3 ranks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> You can use the Appraise skill in place 
of the Spellcraft skill to identify magic items. Appraise is always a 
class skill for you.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Bardic Knowledge and Other Lore Abilities</b></p>
<p align="left">Because bards have access to obscure information, the 
bardic knowledge class feature is a natural avenue for identifying magic
 items. You could simply substitute a bardic knowledge check for a 
Spellcraft check using the mechanic described above. However, since a 
bard is a spellcaster with a respectable number of skill points, his 
Spellcraft modifier may be higher than his bardic knowledge modifier, 
rendering this option superfluous. </p>
<p align="left">A better option might be to add the character's bard 
level to any Spellcraft check (or Appraise check, if you're using 
Solution 3) he makes to identify magic items. This increase represents 
the bard's special familiarity with all manner of magical secrets. 
Logically, the same bonus could apply to any Appraise check the bard 
makes to assess the monetary value of a magic item. </p>
<p align="left">Other lore-based abilities, such as a loremaster's lore, could work the same way.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 5: Dealing with Cursed Items</b></p>
<p align="left">The cursed magic item was a standard of the hobby back 
in the old days, and its existence soon taught many groups never to use 
any magic item until it had been properly identified, for fear of 
getting a <i>necklace of strangulation </i>or a <i>cloak of poisonousness.</i> Nowadays, cursed items are rarely seen in <b>D&amp;D.</b>
 But if you want to keep that possibility in play, you could use the 
Spellcraft, Appraise, or lore techniques described above and add +10 
modifier to the DC to discern that an item is in fact cursed, since most
 cursed items appear as beneficial ones to normal identification.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Identification of magic items in a <b>D&amp;D</b> game 
sometimes threatens to upset the delicate balance between realism and 
convenience. Allowing PCs to know what they have immediately makes the 
game more playable on many levels, but it doesn't feel realistic. The <i>identify</i> and <i>analyze dweomer</i>
 spells provide an in-game solution, but the limitations of casting 
time, expense, and spell level make them less than convenient. One 
possible solution is a house rule allowing characters to use Spellcraft 
(or even Appraise or bardic knowledge) checks to identify items. Cursed 
items are no longer seen in play as much as they once were, but you can 
retain the concept by simply increasing the required check DC to detect a
 curse.</p>
