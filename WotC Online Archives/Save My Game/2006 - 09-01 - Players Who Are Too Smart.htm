<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Players Who Are Too Smart</h4>
<p><i>Recently, one of the players in my game came up with an 
interesting strategy. An army of 300 orcs was gathered around a bonfire,
 trying to keep warm. This player's character was a Psion, possessing a </i>hat of disguise<i>,
 and his plan was to look like an orc (using the hat), waltz into the 
center of the camp, and repeatedly blast the surrounding orcs using his 
Energy Blast power. In order to throw suspecting orcs off his trail, he 
said he was going to imitate the other orcs' actions to make them 
believe he had been hit, too. This would no doubt devastate a massive 
number of orcs, unbalancing the threat that they are meant to impose. 
What would happen in this case? Is there anything (fair and reasonable) 
that I can do?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Bo, from AskWizards.com</p>
<p>You're asking a pair of questions here. Your explicit question is 
whether this plan should work. The subtextual question is whether you 
should let players use unexpectedly clever plans to circumvent what is 
meant to be the challenge of a scenario.</p>
<p>Let me address the second question first. You're right, this is a 
much easier way of dealing with the problem than what you expected. It 
reminds me of a story a friend told about a campaign in which the DM 
created the dire, deadly, and dangerous Forest of Pitch, into which the 
party had to pursue the bad guys. Upon asking the DM for more 
information, he was told that the forest was entirely peopled with 
dangerous monsters and unnatural vegetation and that it was dripping 
with pitch. He quickly came upon the simple expedient of tossing a lit 
torch into the Forest of Pitch and letting nature take its course. The 
flabbergasted DM had evidently not considered the idea that someone 
would simply burn it down. The goal of the mission was accomplished 
without a hint of danger.</p>
<p>Should the DM have let it happen? Should you let it happen? That 
depends. One of the first rules of good DMing is that you must realize 
that it's not a crime for PCs to be really good at something. It's also 
not a crime for the PCs to 'win'. The difference between a tabletop RPG 
and a computer game is that players frequently come up with unexpected, 
even surprising, solutions, and the DM must judge those actions in a 
fair and reasonable way 'on the fly'. As a DM, you must be able to roll 
with the punches. Instead of thinking, "What can I do to stop this from 
happening?" you should be thinking, "How can I figure out what happens 
next and keep the adventure going?"</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2009-01%20-%20Players%20Who%20Are%20Too%20Smart_files/sg_20060901a.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="280" width="200">There
 are times, especially during climactic encounters and situations, when 
you have carefully built up a high level of dramatic tension -- and then
 a sudden end-run by the players lets all the air out of your balloon, 
so to speak. That doesn't need to be a let-down, however. Sometimes, the
 surprise action by a PC might be just the memorable moment you are 
hoping to create. It's not the ending you planned, but it can still be a
 terrific ending. Remember that the PCs are not just driving down a road
 you laid out for them -- all of you are traveling together. Sometimes 
the PCs get to take the wheel, and they might steer the story in a 
direction you never expected, but might be better than what you 
imagined.</p>
<p>Back to your orc situation -- you ask what's fair and reasonable. 
Your psion's plan is a good one, but it's not foolproof. It is only 
reasonable and fair for you to enforce the game's rules on the plan, 
such as the following --</p>
<p><b>1.</b> A <i>hat of disguise</i> grants a +10 bonus on Disguise 
checks, but Disguise must still be opposed by Spot checks. If the psion 
has a good Disguise skill modifier, this may be pretty easy, but if he 
has low Charisma and no ranks in Disguise, it is anything but certain. 
Even with high modifiers, you could potentially make dozens of Spot 
checks for orcs who see the psion up close (all 300 would not get a good
 look at the psion at once, but many would). It takes only one to raise 
the alarm. With so many, you could arbitrarily rule on a statistical 
spread -- say, of the 60 orcs close to the psion, three ought to roll 
20s on their Spot checks, three roll 19s, and so on down the list.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> A <i>hat of disguise</i> emulates the <i>disguise self</i> 
spell, which is a purely visual illusion. Any creatures in the orc camp 
with the scent ability, such as trained wolves or worgs, will 
immediately notice the psion if they are close enough (which depends on 
the direction of the wind).</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Again, a <i>hat of disguise</i> doesn't help if you need to
 talk your way past anyone. Bluff checks will be needed as well as 
fluency in Orcish. Just because you look like an orc doesn't mean you 
can walk through the camp, especially close to the center of it, without
 being challenged or addressed by someone.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Even if your psion gets to the exact center of the orc 
horde and positions his energy burst for maximum effect, he gets 172 
squares worth of targets with a 40-foot radius energy burst. Even 
assuming every square except his own contains an orc, which is unlikely,
 he still gets only a bit over half the army. Depending on how you 
described the scene, a player might argue that the orcs were packed 
together like sardines around one bonfire and should all be within the 
area of effect, but that's your call as the DM. If this army of 300 orcs
 is capable of building only one fire and is dumb enough to cluster 
everyone into a tightly-packed mob (which also denies them their dex 
bonus and imposes a –4 penalty on AC and attacks) AND to put out no 
sentries, then they are probably the ones that have Darwin knocking on 
their door to get selected out. If that describes your orcs, then this 
entire question is pointless. Just let them die and move on.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, your orcs are actually an army which, while 
not too bright, has enough sense to realize that they'll get warmer with
 smaller groups around multiple fires instead of 300 trying to pack 
around one, they will be spread out with no more than orc per square, 
and probably with lanes between the bonfire clusters for people to walk 
through without inciting fights ("Thak step on Ruk's foot! Die Thak, 
die!!!").</p>
<p>But let's assume they are packed fairly tight, one orc per square 
with no gaps except for a few bonfires or smaller campfires. Even after 
the psion works to the center (which will be difficult without stepping 
on Ruk's foot) and lets fly, the survivors, who are presumably spread 
out around the fringes of the blast zone, are free to return fire 
(literally and figuratively) against the only figure left standing at 
the center of the devastation. This exposed position also makes it 
difficult for the psion to get amongst the survivors for a second blast 
unless you as DM have them all conveniently charge into close proximity.
 It's perfectly reasonable for some of the orcs to charge, but they 
aren't completely mindless. Most are going to whip out their bows or 
javelins, and it's Pincushion City for the psion.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> So the psion is going to pretend to react like the other 
orcs to the energy blast? You mean by pretending to be dead? Unless 
these orcs are much tougher than normal, they will all die regardless of
 their saving throw (average orc hit points=5, average fire or cold 
energy blast damage=22.5, halved to 11). He might pull it off … if he 
had an action to spend. He could try a Bluff check to act like a corpse,
 or perhaps a Hide check to blend into an unmoving crowd. The psion 
could argue that the sudden blast of energy creates a sufficient 
distraction to allow hiding. It's an instantaneous effect, however, so 
you could just as easily counter that it's over so quickly it's no help.
 Either option is opposed by Spot, so with all those orcs, someone has a
 good chance to pick out the perpetrator unless he has good skills. 
Remember, it only takes one.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> The orcs aren't going to just sit there and let someone 
blast them. They may be dumb, but they are warriors with a 
self-preservation instinct. Some will probably run -- some will charge 
to attack -- others will get their missiles ready. They may not know 
much about magic, but they know what spellcasters are and that against 
them, it's kill or be killed.</p>
<p>"But energy blast only has an auditory manifestation," you say, "how 
will they know it's me casting it?" Suspend logic for a second. In <i>D&amp;D</i>,
 good, bad, or indifferent, people can tell when you are casting a spell
 or using a power, unless it specifically states otherwise (e.g., a feat
 such as Disguise Spell lets you camouflage your casting as a 
performance). They can't tell what you're casting without a Spellcraft 
check, but they can notice your casting and, sensing your distraction, 
can make AoOs on you. The ability to make AoOs is predicated on being 
aware of the target (which the orcs are, unless the psion beats all 
their Spot checks with his Hide) and being able to attack the target.</p>
<p><b>7.</b> Let's assume that everything goes well -- the psion slinks 
undetected into the orc camp and gets a surprise round, which he uses to
 energy blast. Fair enough, orcs are blasted limb from limb. The psion 
still gets only one action in a surprise round. He can't blast and Hide 
in a surprise round. He can fall prone as a free action after blasting 
in the surprise round, and that would protect him from ranged attacks 
(-4 to hit). The player might argue for a Bluff check to pretend that 
his character is dead, but orcs saw this blast of fire (or whatever) 
come from him, heard its auditory manifestation come from him, and saw 
him drop to the ground. They may not know why that figure, Mr. Generic 
Orc, suddenly erupted in a fountain of magical death ("He's cursed! Burn
 the witch!"), but there's no mistaking that you did. That alone is 
reason enough to chop you into little pieces and make sure you don't do 
it again. Orcs, after all, are often chaotic evil, so they would think 
nothing of turning on one of their own if it furthers their chance to 
survive. "Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"</p>
<p>If the psion wins initiative after the surprise round, he can run 
toward another cluster of orcs and blast again or play dead (Hide as a 
move action, or use Improved Diversion to Bluff and Hide) and ready 
another energy blast for when the rest of the orcs cluster around to 
investigate. But what if the orcs don't cooperate? What if they mill 
around the edges of the circle of death, hesitant to enter what is 
obviously a dangerous space? Worse, what if the orcs win initiative? The
 psion is a sitting duck. The orcs might close to attack, ready a 
barrage of missiles, or both. The psion had better have some other 
options besides energy blast if he wants to get out with his skin intact
 (a <i>potion of protection from arrows</i> would go a long way toward his survival).</p>
<p>As you can see, there are any number of complications that can occur 
with this plan (or any plan that involves strolling into the enemy's 
midst). Some of them are in the setup and some in the execution, but 
your psion's expectations of how the plan should go, while cinematic, 
assume that the orcs will play along. As the axiom goes, "No plan 
survives contact with the enemy." It's the DM's job not only to lay out a
 story but to enforce the mechanics of the rules, play hard, and keep 
the adventure alive. Never just stomp on a good plan. Instead, exploit 
its loopholes and find ways to turn it into more exciting action.</p>
