<p align="left">This column's topic for this installment of <i>Save My Game</i>
 is alignment. Some players are so dedicated to playing an extreme 
alignment to the hilt that they disrupt the game for everyone else. 
What's a DM to do?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Alignments That Cause Problems in Play</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>When I play characters that are lawful, chaotic, or 
evil, I do such a good job that the other players -- and sometimes even 
the DM -- get disgruntled. I know most PCs are good or neutral, but why 
have other alignment options if you can't play them? At the same time, I
 don't really want to bog down the game or upset the other players. How 
can you play extreme alignments without being disruptive? -- Stan</b></p>
<p align="left">Alignment is a sticky subject -- so much so that some 
gamers refuse to use the concept at all. Some players think sticking to 
an alignment is just too much trouble. Others insist that alignment 
restricts the kind of true roleplaying that can flourish when a 
character's personality is allowed to develop naturally, unfettered by 
artificial limitations. Still others use alignment but downplay its 
importance in order to bolster party unity. </p>
<p align="left">Party members certainly have to find ways to work 
together and trust one another regardless of their philosophical 
differences. But does this willingness to put aside disagreements mean 
that PCs just naturally tolerant of other alignments? Or is alignment so
 unobtrusive that it never really shows in character behavior?</p>
<p align="left">Alignment may determine your character's actions ("I do 
this because I'm lawful good") or simply describe them ("I'm lawful good
 because this is what I do"). Whichever explanation you espouse, 
alignment is basically a pattern of attitudes and actions that applies 
universally. The material on alignment in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> 
defines law, chaos, good, evil -- and even the true meaning of neutral 
-- in black-and-white terms. These definitions leave no room for moral 
relativism or cultural interpretation. The orcs may think their people 
are "good" and elves are "bad," but by the universal standards of 
alignment, the reverse is true.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Communication</b></p>
<p align="left">To use alignments properly, both the players and the DM 
must understand and agree on what they really mean in the context of the
 particular campaign. So allow some time for an open discussion of 
alignments. You can start by clarifying the way alignment works in your 
game and how important it is to you that characters adhere to it. Then 
let the players ask questions and make suggestions about how alignments 
should be defined, interpreted, and enforced. Finally, make the 
necessary decisions about any issues still in conflict and tell the 
players how you plan to judge character actions with respect to 
alignment, and what the results of acting against alignment will be. 
Follow up by creating a player handout on alignment in which all these 
decisions are summarized clearly and concisely.</p>
<p align="left">The <i><b>AD&amp;D</b></i><i>Dark Sun Campaign Setting</i>
 gave a great example of an alignment reference guide. The text provided
 an example of what a person of each alignment might do if the group 
were short of water. Giving examples -- especially situations that might
 legitimately occur during an adventure -- helps to ensure understanding
 and get everyone on the same page with respect to this admittedly 
abstract concept.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Backburner</b></p>
<p align="left">In some campaigns, acting in accordance with alignment 
is simply not as important as maintaining party unity. In such 
situations, the characters automatically trust each other regardless of 
alignment, just because they're PCs. Furthermore, both players and DM 
simply assume that the characters manage to work out their philosophical
 differences and function as a unit, without discussing the details 
in-game. Characters in such a game may still squabble about 
alignment-related issues, but they fundamentally get along, and the 
disputes don't cause any serious disruption because alignment ultimately
 doesn't matter much. </p>
<p align="left">This technique downgrades the importance of alignment by
 subjugating it to the greater goal of party unity. Though admirable in 
concept, this solution tends to ensure that no one bothers to roleplay 
alignments effectively, since doing so might cause disruption. To make 
the most of alignment without sacrificing this aspect of play, both the 
players and the DM should consider why and how people of disparate 
alignments might get along and trust each other. This question is far 
from simple -- after all, even characters with the same alignment might 
not get along because they have widely varying goals and dreams. </p>
<p align="left">I have to wonder about the NE wizard mentioned in a 
D&amp;D board posting on the Wizards of the Coast website. The character
 adventured for years with an otherwise LG/NG party, participating in 
their battles against the forces of evil time and time again, but 
somehow he stayed neutral evil. Then, when he and the rest of the PCs 
were high-level characters, the campaign's major villain hired him to 
thwart the party. Does his acceptance mean that he has been a 
super-double-secret deep-cover sleeper agent since 1st level? What 
exactly was evil about him? What evil acts did he commit in years while 
he was fighting alongside the forces of good? Should such a character 
have to act evil in order to be evil? To what extent does one act of 
evil counterbalance a whole adventuring career devoted to good? It's 
certainly possible to be (or become) evil while working beside the good 
guys -- just look at Raistlin. But how far undercover can a character go
 before his "cover" becomes his real identity, and he loses touch with 
his original ideals?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Metagame</b></p>
<p align="left">Even after long debate, you and your players may not 
come to a satisfactory consensus as to why characters of different 
alignments might get along with one another in the game. If attempts to 
be true to alignment are seriously disrupting play, you as DM might have
 to resort to metagame solutions. Applying XP penalties, negative 
levels, or curses can go a long way toward keeping players from 
disrupting the game with unnecessary alignment-based arguments.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Alignment Restrictions</b></p>
<p align="left">Another method of ensuring that alignment play does not 
disrupt the game is to simply restrict the alignments available to PCs. 
If desired, you can allow the players to decide which alignments are 
acceptable for the party, or at least consider their input in your 
decision. Thereafter, any character with an alignment other than those 
the group has deemed appropriate is simply not accepted into the party. 
This method ensures that everyone's character will fit into the party 
and prevents anyone from introducing a demon-worshiping necromancer into
 a party of paladins. However, it also restricts your options for 
ongoing plotlines. For example, the characters are almost certainly safe
 from betrayal by an assassin PC who has infiltrated the group, or even a
 secretly evil character who could turn on them at a later time.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 5: New DM</b></p>
<p align="left">If you and the players can't agree on how to treat 
alignment play in your game, you may want to suggest that another DM 
take the reins for the kind of game they wish to have. For example, if 
the players want a game with all evil PCs and you don't want to run one,
 you don't have to feel pressured to do so. It's true that everybody at 
the table should have a say in the basic set-up of the campaign, but the
 DM has a greater say because she has to put in more time and energy 
than anyone else. A group can't force a DM to run a game she isn't going
 to enjoy, even if everyone else wants it. Thus, if the players really 
want an evil campaign, suggest that someone else run it for as long as 
people want to play it, or suggest alternating play sessions between 
that campaign and the one you want to run.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">If you and your players enjoy the bickering common to 
groups whose members roleplay their alignments to the hilt, feel free to
 do so as much as you wish. In my experience, however, most gamers don't
 have the time or inclination to deal with that kind of disruptive 
behavior. They would much rather spend their precious gaming time 
focusing on a heroic adventure than on party politics and plotting. A 
group with one or two players who insist on roleplaying that disrupts 
rather than unites the group should be encouraged to either develop new 
habits that are more conducive to cooperative play or find another game 
more suited to their style.</p>
