<p align="LEFT">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Evil Is as Evil Does</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">What's a DM to do when the players prefer evil 
characters who just want to pillage and burn and aren't interested in 
the adventure hooks he uses for his scenarios? This installment of <i>Save My Game</i>
 examines ways to ensure that evil characters have enough motivation to 
undertake missions and offers suggestions for adventure plots tailored 
to those motivations. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Problem: No Stomach for Evil</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>I'm currently DMing an Eberron campaign, and my 
players tend toward evil PCs. But I'm not good at running evil games. I 
can't wrap my mind around the appropriate attitude, so I find myself 
struggling for workable adventure ideas. Four evil characters have no 
motivation whatsoever to save a burning forest when doing so involves no
 monetary reward and great risk. And most of my ideas for adventures are
 unsuitable for the old "we'll pay you" or "you can gain undreamed-of 
power " ploys. Do you have any advice? -- </i><b>Adam Davis</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2005%20-%2012-09%20-%20Adventures%20for%20Evil%20PCs_files/savemygame_evil.jpg" align="right" border="1">The
 obvious solution to a problem such as this one is just not to run an 
evil campaign. That answer may sound flip, but it isn't. Everyone at the
 table should be having fun -- and that includes the DM, who works much 
harder than the players do to keep the campaign going. So if you're not 
having fun DMing the campaign in its current form, don't do it. Either 
start a new campaign more suited to your taste and skills, or let one of
 the other players get behind the DM's screen. Of course, if all the 
other players want to play evil PCs and you don't, then you may just 
need to search for a new group.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's assume that 
you do want to continue the campaign -- you just want to do a better job
 and get more enjoyment out of it. Here are a few ideas to explore.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 1: Find out What Evil Means</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">As a DM, you need to decide exactly what constitutes 
evil in your campaign world. Sure, you can argue that orcs and demons 
think their way is best and therefore consider paladins and archons to 
be the "bad guys." But in the universal order that's basic to the game, 
some creatures are evil and some are good. These concepts are absolute 
-- personal opinion and cultural perspectives don't factor into it. The <i>Player's Handbook</i>
 offers some basic explanations of what the various alignments mean, but
 you may want to make your own list of traits, behaviors, or activities 
that mark a person, creature, or society as evil.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For a more in-depth look at what constitutes evil, check out the various supplements that deal with the topic, such as <i>Book of Vile Darkness, Champions of Ruin, Lords of Darkness,</i> and <i>Heroes of Horror.</i>
 Look through the various campaign settings for evil deities, evil 
nations, and evil organizations, then find out what they do that makes 
them evil. Dig up some old Ravenloft supplements, such as Van Richten's 
Guides, that describe all sorts of evil types. You're not likely to find
 a perfect fit for your campaign world, but such research should give 
you a general idea what constitutes evil in the <b>D&amp;D</b> universe.
 Once you have a firm grasp on evil, you can see how well the concept 
integrates with the way you want to run your game.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 2: Make the Players Do the Work</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Why do your players want to play evil characters anyway?
 Are the PCs just amoral villains who want to rob and kill every 
creature that crosses their path -- including other party members? Do 
they simply act without conscience? From a roleplaying perspective, that
 kind of reasoning is pretty lame.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If they have some specific goals that can best be 
attained by evil behavior, that's another situation altogether. Or 
perhaps the PCs are evil because they actually have an evil plan, serve 
an evil mentor, or function as evil mercenaries for hire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Another question to consider is what drove the PCs to 
become evil? Were they born that way? Outsiders with the evil subtype 
have innately evil natures in the <b>D&amp;D</b> game, so PCs descended 
from these creatures (such as tieflings or half-fiends) might logically 
tend toward the same natural alignment. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But in most cases, evil doesn't just happen. As in real 
life, a character usually goes bad for a reason. Is she criminally 
insane? Was she raised in an evil culture? Or was she perhaps an evil 
outcast from a good society? How and why a character turns to the dark 
side tells a lot about what kind of evil person she will become.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series, people give 
themselves over to the Shadow for all kinds of reasons. From the 
rank-and-file Darkfriends to the secretive Black Ajah to the Forsaken 
(the Dark One's own inner circle of super-villains) -- the various evil 
individuals and groups have a variety of reasons for going down the dark
 path. Some turned to evil almost as a lark, then later discovered the 
gravity of their choices when an honest-to-goodness, serious bad guy 
came calling on them to fulfill their oaths. Others became evil out of 
greed, ambition, or jealousy, or even to gain power or knowledge. </p>
<p align="LEFT">So if your players want to play evil characters, make 
them explain how their current outlook evolved and where they see the 
characters going from here. A player should think about such questions 
for any PC, but it's especially important to understand the motivations 
of evil characters so that you can make up suitable adventures for them.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 3: Invert the Adventure</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">To create an adventure for an evil party, simply take a 
standard adventure and turn it upside down. Have the evil king ask the 
PCs to investigate a ruined temple of good that's rising again and 
causing trouble. Perhaps its members are raiding his caravans, or even 
trying to complete a Blessed Dawn of Freedom ritual that will conjure an
 army of angels to wreak devastation on the countryside. It's up to your
 PCs to stand up for the forces of evil! </p>
<p align="LEFT">To invert an adventure, take the same kind of plot you 
would use for a good party and substitute good monsters and NPCs for the
 evil opponents. Those naughty elves are menacing the goblin forest, 
which contains an infamous and powerful unhallowed grove that must be 
protected at all costs. And if the grove falls into good hands, it's 
only a matter of time before those good forces come for the PCs! Evil 
characters understand self-preservation just as well as good ones do, so
 let the threat of such retribution motivate your PCs from time to time.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Solution 4: Adventurers are Adventurers -- Evil or Not</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Lots of adventures boil down to finding the monster, 
killing it, and taking its loot. Just because the PCs and the dragon are
 both evil doesn't mean they don't want to kill each other. Evil fights 
evil all the time -- just look at the Blood War between the demons and 
the devils. And lots of monsters are so territorial and hostile that 
they don't much care how good or evil the PCs are. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The actual work of adventuring is often 
alignment-irrelevant, aside from such issues as taking prisoners and 
whether striking the first blow is (or needs to be) justified. If the 
Great Destroyer is rising to annihilate the world, good and evil may 
need to rise up together to thwart its apocalyptic fury. They may use 
different means, but the goal is the same.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When you run an evil campaign, a lot depends on 
character motivation. You could run plenty of adventures the same way 
for good or evil parties. But since your players seem to be defining 
their characters' evil natures as "not good," they are not motivated to 
do the kinds of "good" deeds that you're used to using for adventure 
hooks. But the lack of a motivation to act in one way doesn't 
necessarily equal a motivation to act in another. Your players need to 
decide what they are interested in doing, both individually and as a 
group, if their characters are to come together and risk their lives for
 a common goal. If the players want evil PCs, what kind of evil do they 
want to be? Once you know that, creating adventures that relate to 
matters in which the party is interested should become a lot easier.</p>
