<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game! </p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Powergaming: How to Deal with Super-High ACs</b></p>
<p align="left">The topic for this installment of <i>Save My Game</i> is
 powergaming. Some players are so focused on utilizing the game's 
character-building options that they create problems for DMs who are 
trying to balance their games for more average characters. A case in 
point is players who build characters with ACs so high that they can't 
be hit at all by monsters that would otherwise be appropriate challenges
 for their level. What's a DM to do?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Powergaming and High ACs</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Powergaming players can pose a serious problem for a 
DM who isn't prepared to cope with the ways in which they can stretch 
the rules. For example, how can a DM deal with a character who has a 
super-high Armor Class? I've seen characters use <i>alter self</i> and 
similar spells to raise their ACs to astronomical levels. -- 
Neonsamurai, from the D&amp;D boards on the Wizards of the Coast website</b></p>
<p align="left">First of all, it's not a crime for a PC to be good at 
some aspect of the game -- even really good. A player who has put a lot 
of resources into pumping up his character's AC shouldn't be penalized 
for doing so. The same goes for players who have chosen to beef up their
 characters' attack rolls, damage, speed, spellcasting, or any other 
ability. D&amp;D is all about trade-offs, and if a player chooses to 
invest all or most of his character's resources into AC at the expense 
of other attributes, that's okay! After all, choosing where to place the
 emphasis when creating a character is part of playing the game, and 
some players enjoy hedging their bets in certain ways.</p>
<p align="left">But those choices do have consequences. Every defensive 
spell a PC casts is one less offensive spell she has available. 
Furthermore, that defensive spell might be wasted if the character isn't
 attacked before its duration expires, and it's susceptible to 
dispelling as well. Likewise, every defensive feat taken is a feat slot 
not devoted to another aspect of the character. And gold spent on magic 
armor, shields, or other defensive items is not available for weapons 
and offensive or miscellaneous magic items. All that is as it should be 
in a game built with choices rather than limits.</p>
<p align="left">However, the foregoing doesn't address a DM's very real 
frustration with a character who can't be hit in combat because his 
Armor Class is so high. So let's look at some specific ways to address 
the problem of very high AC in play.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Enforce the Rules</b></p>
<p align="left">You may have to accept a good powergamer's efforts to 
ratchet up AC with grace, but you should never give a cheater an even 
break. Enforcing the rules strictly ensures that the game stays fair, no
 matter how players choose to allocate resources. For example, using <i>alter self</i>
 to increase Armor Class isn't as good an option as it may seem. It's a 
fine spell, but a character can use it only on himself, and only to 
assume the form of a creature of his own type (humanoid for most PCs) 
with HD no higher than his caster level (maximum 5). The caster gets the
 physical qualities -- both good and bad -- of the new form, and some of
 those may be worse than his own. </p>
<p align="left">Aasimar or tiefling PCs may get more mileage out of this
 spell than most PCs, since they can use it to turn into outsiders, but 
few low-HD choices exist within that type. Furthermore, since many 
outsiders do not have humanoid forms, the PC's equipment may become 
unusable, and he may be unable to cast spells. Mephits are among the 
best choices for outsider PCs using <i>alter self,</i> since those creatures have low HD and various special abilities.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Limit the Damage</b></p>
<p align="left">If <i>alter self</i> creates problems in the hands of a powergamer, <i>polymorph</i>
 creates worse ones. With this spell, a PC can turn into almost 
anything, and the boost to her natural armor bonus can be extreme. If 
you don't like what this spell (or any other, for that matter) does to 
your game, get rid of it! You're the boss, and you're perfectly within 
your rights to disallow any portion of the rules that doesn't fit your 
campaign.</p>
<p align="left">If you don't want to get rid of a useful spell just 
because one person abuses its power, you can always place your own 
limits on it. Many of the problems it causes stem from PCs using it to 
duplicate exotic creatures, so limit the available forms to creatures 
from the <i>Monster Manual, </i>plus those that the caster has personally encountered or researched using Knowledge skills.</p>
<p align="left">Still another solution is to create different versions of <i>polymorph </i>at
 different spell levels, with the higher-level versions allowing more 
powerful forms that offer higher natural armor bonuses and other 
benefits. Alternatively, you could rule that the maximum natural armor 
bonus the spell can grant equals the user's caster level, regardless of 
the form chosen. </p>
<p align="left">In short, if a spell or other effect causes trouble, 
limit it in a way that matches what you think it should do, or disallow 
it entirely if it becomes the source of too many abuses and arguments.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Look at Your DMing</b></p>
<p align="left">Another way to approach the problem is to take a serious
 look at your DMing style. Have you allowed exotic races that have 
super-high bonuses to ability scores or AC to be used as player 
characters? Are you interpreting rules regarding stacking too 
liberally--perhaps allowing the natural bonus from wild armor to stack 
with the one from <i>polymorph</i>? Are you giving out so much treasure 
that PCs can buy up all the AC-increasing items they want? Are you 
allowing them to create items or spells that grant AC bonuses of 
nonstandard types (such as sacred, profane, morale, luck, insight, 
exalted, competence, or dodge), so that they will stack with the more 
common armor, enhancement, natural armor, and deflection bonuses? If you
 answered yes to any of these questions, you may have to retool your 
house rules to cut down on such abuses. In that case, be sure to tell 
your players up front that you will be adjusting the rules to achieve a 
fairer and more exciting game--don't just spring the new rules on them 
without explanation.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Be Creative</b></p>
<p align="left">If you want characters with ultra-high ACs to be in just
 as much danger as the rest of the party in a fight, try thinking out of
 the box. Combat doesn't have to be a one-on-one situation in which the 
monster's attack roll has to meet or beat the character's AC. Try 
setting up a fight in which the opponent relies on attacks that don't 
require attack rolls, such as area spells, automatic-hit spells, swarms,
 and trample attacks. Touch attacks -- including rays and other spells 
as well as trip, grapple, and bull rush attacks -- can also be quite 
deadly.</p>
<p align="left">Against a higher-level party, try using a creature that 
has multiple attacks, since the more times you get to roll, the better 
chance you have to score a hit. You can also change the monster's feat 
selection to include Multiattack and Improved Multiattack if it 
qualifies for them, thus increasing its ability to hit with secondary 
attacks. Avoid using Power Attack against characters with very high ACs,
 since you need the full attack roll to have the best chance of scoring a
 hit. If the monster's statistics already have Power Attack figured in, 
adjust them to remove that feature. Finally, make sure your bad guys 
make the best possible use of <i>bless, prayer, </i>the bardic music inspire courage ability, and any other options they may have available for increasing their attack bonuses.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 5: Team up!</b></p>
<p align="left">Lastly and most importantly, team up your monsters! 
Tough monsters can become much tougher with a little help from their 
friends. Flanking the PCs is an obvious tactic, but you can also use 
team grappling against the party if the situation permits. Even better, 
surround the PCs with many enemies, some of which have reach weapons 
that enable them to attack from the second rank. When you use multiple 
attackers, have the ones that are least likely to hit use the aid 
another action to give the main fighters a big bonus. </p>
<p align="left">Alternatively, some of the attackers can use <i>summon monster</i>
 to bring in additional creatures. Use these not to attack the party, 
but to provide the main opponents with bonuses from flanking and aid 
another, and to absorb attacks from the PCs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Powergamers can cause headaches for a DM by creating 
characters who have capabilities far beyond those of comparable-level 
characters. Enforce the rules, but don't punish players for legitimate 
choices they make. Do, however, ensure that the game remains exciting 
for both the powergamer and the rest of the group by tightening up your 
house rules to minimize unfair advantages, disallowing effects that 
cause too many problems, using monsters and their abilities creatively, 
and teaming up the opponents to maximize their advantages.</p>
