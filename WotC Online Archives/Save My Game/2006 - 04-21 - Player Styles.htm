<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Player Styles</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>Why not do an article about player styles and how to 
incorporate them into one’s game? Making the game fun for everyone is 
one of the greatest challenges facing many DMs. Just don't do anything 
foolish and classify disruptive behaviors as a player style. Being a 
jackass on purpose and intentional playing a depressed loner that has no
 interest in adventuring with a group just causes problems and shows 
disrespect for everyone else at the table. Including the DM. You could 
write a few articles on how to deal with disruptive players. Such as: 
cheaters, jackasses, and sleepers. </i><b>-- On_the_wings_of_TPK, from Wizards message boards</b></p>
<p align="left">Player styles is a question that every DM has to face, and one that has been dealt with in various forms in <i>Dragon</i> Magazine articles or (somewhat more humorously) on the web or in <i>Knights of the Dinner Table</i>.
 There are as many gaming styles (or gamer stereotypes) as there are 
gamers, but we all know the basics. Rules Lawyer. Powergamer. Real 
Roleplayer. Frustrated Artiste. Whiny Munchkin. Mr. Just Happy To Be 
Here.</p>
<p align="left">That’s a worthy topic, but your second issue is a more 
urgent one, dealing with problematic or disruptive players. Dealing with
 player behavior is infinitely trickier than dealing with character 
behavior. As the DM, you are ultimately in control of what happens with 
the characters and what they can do, but you don’t have that kind of 
final say over what the people sitting around the table are going to do.
 That’s why DMing is about far more than knowing the rules and having 
(or making) the free time to bring to life a fantasy world. It also 
requires people skills, because you are as much a manager and a coach as
 you are a storyteller and a referee. And part of being a manager is 
knowing how and when to interfere when someone has (or is) a problem.</p>
<p align="left"><b>1. The sleeper</b></p><img src="2006%20-%2004-21%20-%20Player%20Styles_files/savemygame_sleeper.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">I’m
 assuming we’re not talking about someone who nods off when the game 
runs until 2:00 AM because of that mega-battle and an hour has passed 
since his last turn. For someone who regularly is checked out, the first
 rule -- as always -- is to just talk to the person. Find out what’s 
going on in their non-gaming life that makes them so sleepy. Maybe they 
need a break from the game until their work or school schedule calms 
down so they can get some shuteye at home. Then again, maybe your game 
is boring them to sleep, whether from being too complicated or too 
simple or too repetitive or whatever. They might need a new game. They 
might be having a good time just getting together with friends for as 
long as they can keep their eyes open, and are happy with that. The 
question is whether everyone else is happy too.</p>
<p align="left">A sleeper (and yes, I’ve had one) is hard to deal with 
as a ‘problem’ because they usually don’t cause much disruption, unless 
the other players start playing pranks on him while he’s out cold or 
unless he snores like a buzzsaw. Usually just calling their name or a 
poke in the ribs is enough to rouse a sleeper and get them back in the 
game, but it can get annoying for you as a DM to keep waking them up and
 recapping what’s going on so they can take their turn. Maybe you could 
keep some coffee, Mountain Dew, or No-Doz on hand, or suggest the 
sleepyhead do the same just out of general respect for the group. Still,
 a sleeper is usually a situational thing rather than a chronic problem,
 and one that’s not such a big deal.</p>
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" align="center" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" border="0" width="550"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#E6E6E6"><td>
<p align="left"><i>Producer’s Note</i>: Of all the roles, I admittedly 
fall into this category. The catch -- as I justify it -- is that 
different players have different gaming stamina; while some players 
prefer all-night sessions -- and the later the better! -- others hit a 
wall after a certain time. Part of the solution as a DM may simply be to
 recognize these differences and plan accordingly: When you see some of 
your players hitting the wall in terms of their attention, you may want 
to call a break or even call it a night… at least for them. If other 
players are interested in continuing, you might plan a side trek or two 
for them to extend the session. Or, try having them switch to a 
secondary set of characters, working on a different set of goals 
relative to the same campaign.</p>

<p align="left"><b>2. The cheater</b></p><img src="2006%20-%2004-21%20-%20Player%20Styles_files/savemygame_cheater.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">Okay,
 everyone has fudged a die roll now and then, and DMs do it twice as 
much as any player. No big deal. What creates a problem attitude is when
 we’re talking about a habitual cheater. This goes beyond 
rules-lawyering, although a good rules lawyer may be able to bamboozle 
you into letting something slide that shouldn’t be technically 
allowable, unless you can beat them at an opposed Knowledge (rules) or 
Profession (rules lawyer) skill check. The first step in dealing with a 
cheater of any stripe, but especially this kind, is to make sure that 
you have a firm grasp of the rules of the game. If things sound like 
they don’t add up, you can call for an audit at any time, so a player 
can justify how it is their attack rolls or saves are always so high.</p>
<p align="left">As a side note, if a player whips out some obscure 
supplement you’ve never read, draw the line at rule zero; I don’t care 
if Wizards of the Coast published it. If you haven’t read it and said 
it’s in play for your campaign, then they can forget it. If your player 
wants you to look at it in between gaming sessions and <i>ask</i> if you’ll use or allow a new rule, you can talk about it, but no fair trying to blindside the DM.</p>
<p align="left">As for players rerolling their dice rolls, make sure 
everything is rolled on the table, where everyone can see it. As a DM, I
 usually roll my stuff out on the table, even though I don’t have to; it
 sets a good example. Players who say they prerolled a whole list of 
rolls and they’re just going to use them in order as you call for them 
should be laughed out of the room. I won’t even go into loaded dice, 
because hopefully even the most cheaterous gamer would have enough 
self-respect not to stoop to that.</p>
<p align="left">Just like in the real world, the most insidious cheats 
are buried in accounting: e.g., players who ‘forget’ to mark off hit 
points when they’re injured, or neglect to keep track of charges used 
from magic items, or gp or XP spent on item creation or purchases. It’s 
basically impossible for you to keep track of everything that every 
character has and its current status, so you really have to trust your 
players to be honest about it. At lower levels or in a low magic 
campaign it may be easier for you to keep track of things like that, or 
if you have a laptop with a spreadsheet for all your characters, you 
could do the accounting for them, but that seems like a whole lot of 
extra work you shouldn’t have to do. If you think someone is taking 
advantage, you may check their character sheet and do a short-term 
personal accounting for that character to keep track of what they use or
 hit points or whatever, then re-audit it later to see whether the 
numbers add up.</p>
<p align="left"><b>3. The jerk</b></p><img src="2006%20-%2004-21%20-%20Player%20Styles_files/savemygame_jerk.jpg" align="right" border="0"><p align="left">Nothing
 is more annoying than a player who writes CN on his character sheet and
 takes that as his birthright to be a complete pain in the butt for 
everyone else at the table. Every annoying, childish, idiotic, selfish, 
and obnoxious thing they do is supposedly covered by saying, “Hey, I’m 
just playing my character!” One of the amusing moments in the 
live-action <i>Scooby-Doo</i> movie is when the Scooby gang gets sick 
and tired of the idiotic Scrappy-Doo, and dump him off on the side of 
the road. That’s what happens to people who are traveling together and 
one person alienates everyone around him. They get left behind.</p>
<p align="left">Adventuring with a group is a privilege, not a right. 
Sure, there are lots of examples of heroes in fantasy and sci-fi that 
are abrasive, obnoxious, and antisocial. But curiously enough, most of 
them are lone wolves, out on their own. They work by themselves because 
no one can stand to work with them, unless thrown together on a 
temporary basis for some emergency or other. Once the emergency is over,
 they go back to being by themselves or they change their attitudes and 
learn how to get along with the group. </p>
<p align="left">In an RPG, characters out for themselves endanger the 
group and lessen the group’s chances of success. Even if they betray the
 enemy and eventually achieve some goal the party had, if they do that 
by first betraying the party (like Raistlin, for example), their 
companions have to deal with that betrayal and its effects. Similarly, a
 player who puts his own petty amusement and juvenile antics above the 
opportunity for other people at the table to have a good time is being 
disrespectful to the rest of the group at best and a couple of 
unprintable expletives at worst. They may still achieve the goals they 
have as a group, but they have to deal with all manner of aggravation 
from the Jerk to get there. <b>D&amp;D</b> is a game. Having to deal 
with a Jerk in the party/group makes it more like work, like you have to
 stretch and strain to squeeze the fun out instead of it just being 
there.</p>
<p align="left">Don’t get me wrong; it’s perfectly okay to be sarcastic and say obnoxious things once in a while, and even to have that as a <i>part</i>
 of your character’s personality, or even for a character to 
dramatically betray the party. Like any other player problem, these 
things become a problem when they happen <i>all the time</i>! Moderation is the key, and knowing when to dial it back is what separates an amusing quirk from a game-wrecking jerkitude.</p><br><p align="left">Of course, none of this really addresses the problem of what you <i>do</i>
 with a problem player. Sometimes the problem is just a passing thing, a
 player tired or in a sour mood or stressed out from work, and it will 
work itself out, so the first course is to try waiting it out and seeing
 if it will go away. If tolerance doesn’t work, the next step is 
pointing out the problem, in private, DM to player. By that time, you’ve
 probably had complaints from other players, but you can summarize and 
suggest the player work on toning down their bad habit. Other players 
may talk with the problem player on their own, but you are the filter 
for concerns brought to the group. If the problem persists even after 
it’s been pointed out, then your gaming group is going to have to sit 
down and decide, as a group, what to do about it. Has the problem become
 severe enough that people are thinking of quitting the group over it? 
If so, who stays and who goes? Will you split your gaming group because 
some just can’t play nice with others? Hopefully it won’t come to that, 
be prepared that there may be no way to resolve things without hard 
feelings.</p>
