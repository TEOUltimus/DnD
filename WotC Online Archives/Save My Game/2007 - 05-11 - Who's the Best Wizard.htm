<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Choosing the Best Race for Your Wizard</h4>
<p><i>I am fairly new to this concept, and have a few questions:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>When playing a wizard, what is the best race that offers the most towards his abilities?</i></li>
<li><i>When can you choose different classes and races in campaigns? 
[Say you are playing a basic campaign, and you want to be a Wu Jen Drow]
 would that be allowed?</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>That's all the questions I have right now, and any other helpful information for beginners would be much appreciated, thanks.</i></p>
<p align="right"><i>-- Kevin, from AskWizards.com</i></p>
<p>Kevin is a new player, and <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/sg/20070504">last time</a>
 we answered a question about whether you should always start a campaign
 with a new, low-level character. To follow up, we now turn to the other
 questions he has about the game.</p>
<p>The answer to what race makes the best wizard is an interesting one, 
because there are a lot of possible answers depending on what you want 
your wizard to be. Combining your race with your class is something you 
might do because you have a vision in your mind of what you want your 
character to be. If your idea of a wizard is Gandalf or Elminster, you 
probably want to be human. If you're thinking more of Galadriel or 
Elric, you might lean more toward an elf or half-elf.</p>
<p>I think your question, though, is more meant to ask what are the 
game-rule benefits of the different races as wizards. I'll try to give a
 rundown on the advantages of each.</p>
<p><b>Dwarf</b></p>
<p><i>Pros: </i>Wizards have bad hit points and Fortitude saves, and your Constitution helps these. It also helps your Concentration skill.</p>
<p><i>Cons: </i>Your lower speed might make it hard for you to keep your distance when enemies close in to attack you.</p>
<p><b>Elf</b></p>
<p><i>Pros: </i>Free proficiency with a bow is a nice backup when you 
run out of spells or if your spells don't work, especially with your 
Dexterity bonus on ranged attacks. Dexterity helps your generally poor 
Armor Class and Reflex saves. Wizard is also a favored class for elves, 
so it is easier to multiclass and combine wizard with other classes. 
Your bonus to Spot, Listen, and Search is good, because none of those 
are class skills. Your free Search check to notice secret doors will 
probably be good, because your Intelligence score should be high.</p>
<p><i>Cons:</i> Your Consititution penalty hits you where you are already weak -- Fortitude saves and hit points.</p>
<p><b>Gnome</b></p>
<p><i>Pros:</i> Your Constitution bonus helps offset a wizard's weak 
Fortitude saves, hit points, and Concentration skill. You are also good 
with illusion spells and could build your wizard around that. You get a 
bonus to Craft (alchemy), a useful wizard skill.</p>
<p><i>Cons:</i> Your small size and low Strength limit how much gear you
 can carry, including your spellbooks, and your slow speed makes it 
harder for you to avoid melee.</p>
<p><b>Half-Elf</b></p>
<p>No real pros or cons to being a wizard.</p>
<p><b>Half-Orc</b></p>
<p>Not a good choice in terms of rules-based benefits. Intelligence is a
 wizard's most important ability score, and half-orcs suffer a penalty 
there. Play a half-orc wizard only as an interesting role-playing 
challenge.</p>
<p><b>Halfling</b></p>
<p><i>Pros:</i> Your bonus with thrown weapons, combined with your small
 size and Dexterity, make you dangerous with thrown daggers as a cheap 
and effective backup for your spells. You also excel with spells that 
require ranged attack rolls, such as ray spells. Your small size and 
Dexterity improve your poor Armor Class and Reflex saves and make it 
easier for you to hide when danger threatens.</p>
<p><i>Cons:</i> Your small size and lowered Strength make it hard to 
carry much equipment, especially your spell books. Your low speed also 
makes it hard to stay out of melee.</p>
<p><b>Humans</b></p>
<p><i>Pros:</i> Getting a bonus feat is always great. It puts you one 
step ahead in getting feats in a necessary sequence, such as Spell 
Focus/Greater Spell Focus, or a combination such as Spell Focus 
(conjuration) and Augment Summoning, as early as 1st level.</p>
<p><i>Cons:</i> None really, although humans lack special senses such as
 darkvision and low-light vision which often come in handy, especially 
at lower levels. The extra skill points for being human may not be as 
valuable for a wizard as they would be for other classes, because your 
high Intelligence means you probably have enough skill points anyway.</p>
<p>Those are all the basic races. Overall, humans and elves probably 
make the best wizards. A little care and thought when designing your 
character, however, can yield a halfling or gnome that equals a human or
 elf. Half-orcs are really the only poor choice for a wizard.</p>
<p>As to your second question, it relates to the first, in that there 
are exotic races from various sourcebooks that make excellent wizards. 
Any race with an Intelligence bonus is a viable choice. Look for good 
movement rates (to stay out of combat), good Dexterity (to improve 
ranged attacks and ranged spells and improve a wizard's poor Armor Class
 and Reflex saves), good Constitution (to offset a wizard's poor hit 
points and Fortitude saves), and small size. All of those are positive 
attributes for wizards (who rarely carry heavy armor or weapons -- 
usually their spellbooks are their biggest burden). Races with 
spell-like abilities are less useful, because they can already 'cast 
spells', but defensive abilities such as spell resistance or damage 
reduction are great.</p>
<p>Whether you want to introduce a lot of new and exotic races and 
classes, though, is always a tough question. It adds choices and 
variety, but every new book added to the campaign is another load on the
 mind of the DM (and to a lesser extent the other players).</p>
<p>Because you're relatively new to the game, I suggest sticking with 
the core books. There is a lot of variety there, a lot of ability to 
customize your character, and plenty of chances to practice your skills 
at the game. I would add in other options (classes, races, or otherwise)
 one or a few at a time, on an experimental basis. If some things seem 
over- or underpowered, be willing to adjust them a little, or to simply 
rule them out -- "Yeah, we tried it, but it didn't work out very well." 
It's fun to experiment, but give the core rules a fair chance before you
 jump into the deep end of trying a little bit of everything.</p>
