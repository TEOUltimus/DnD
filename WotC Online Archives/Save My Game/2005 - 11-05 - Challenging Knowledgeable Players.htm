<p align="left">This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are 
in trouble. Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues 
both inside and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas 
fall flat? Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? 
Worry no more, because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your 
game!</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Challenges for Jaded Players</b></p>
<p align="left">This installment of <i>Save My Game</i> continues to 
examine what happens when players bring out-of-character knowledge into 
the game. What's a DM to do when player knowledge of the <i>Monster Manual</i> takes all the surprise out of encounters?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Problem: Keeping the Element of Surprise in Your Game</b></p>
<p align="left"><i>My players have memorized the </i>Monster Manual,<i> 
so they recognize every monster I throw at them. How can I provide 
surprises and challenges for them without making them feel cheated out 
of using their knowledge?</i> -- <b>Maggie at Wizards of the Coast</b></p>
<p align="left">You can always find an interesting, weird, and 
surprising monster to spring on your party, but unfamiliarity alone 
isn't enough to make the encounter a challenge if the creature just 
isn't tough enough to mix it up with your PCs. Conversely, a 
straightforward, unsurprising encounter can be a serious test. Sometimes
 the tactics that work are not a surprise because everyone knows darn 
well that they are at the top of the option list, but the encounter is a
 satisfying challenge anyway. A red dragon is perhaps the most 
stereotypical of all <b>D&amp;D</b> monsters, but no one would deny that facing one down in mortal combat is a challenge.</p>
<p align="left">One obvious suggestion for adding the element of 
surprise to an encounter is to use creative spellcasting (especially 
high-level spells) to alter or boost enemy capabilities. Another is to 
make use of new monsters from any of a zillion sources, or create NPCs 
with new magic items and prestige classes. Another good option is to 
apply templates from the core books, or the various supplements that 
Wizards has produced (just take a look at our <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/eo">Elite Opponents</a></i> archives at, or the new <i>Creature Incarnations</i> column -- Coming Soon), or even <b>Dragon</b> Magazine.</p>
<p align="left">But DMing style and strategy can also play a big role in
 keeping players on their toes. Below are a few suggestions for making 
encounters both surprising and challenging for players who memorize the 
books. For the most part, they involve only the core books, though other
 books can also provide plenty of ideas. If you use these concepts to 
beef up the opposition, however, be sure to increase the CR/EL of your 
creatures and encounters accordingly to avoid overwhelming (or 
under-rewarding) your PCs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 1: Use Different Equipment</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-05%20-%20Challenging%20Knowledgeable%20Players_files/dx1104sg_savemygame_creature.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="318" width="250">Don't
 just equip your monsters and NPCs with the standard gear. Better armor 
and weapons -- especially a mix of reach, close-combat, and ranged 
weapons -- can vastly improve their combat effectiveness while staying 
nice and legal. PCs often carry more than one type of weapon, so why 
shouldn't your monsters? </p>
<p align="left">Consider your monsters' gear carefully prior to each encounter. For example, giants throwing rocks is the stuff of classic <b>D&amp;D</b>,
 but are rocks really better than appropriately sized composite longbows
 or slings? And why shouldn't they have access to masterwork weapons or 
heavy armor, just like PCs do? </p>
<p align="left">In some cases, logistics may seem to present a barrier 
to improving a monster's equipment. For example, you might wonder who's 
making all these items for the monsters. For the most part, however, 
buying and selling weapons, armor, and magic is pretty easy in the <b>D&amp;D</b>
 world. Arms dealers don't usually care who's good or bad as long as 
they get paid. And why wouldn't evil races have their own "in-house" 
experts maintaining forges and armories, or trade with other evil races 
or cultures that do? </p>
<p align="left">Specialty items do cost money, no matter who commissions
 them. But giants and other monsters have treasure, don't they? Some 
monsters may collect gold for the sake of collecting, like a dragon 
does, but wouldn't reasonably intelligent creatures think about 
sacrificing some of their shiny-brights for better armament?</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 2: Use Nonstandard Feat Selections</b></p>
<p align="left">A lot of monsters come preloaded with handy feats such 
as Alertness and Improved Initiative. Except for racial bonus feats, 
however, individual monsters are free to choose any feats they wish, 
just like PCs are. So if you wish, you can reshuffle their feats a bit 
to tailor your monsters to their equipment or their situations. </p>
<p align="left">You can find plenty of options for feat restructuring 
just within the core rulebooks, so look for feats tailored to a 
monster's particular fighting style. For example, a monster with great 
attack rolls could have Combat Expertise (if it normally faces a lot of 
foes) or Power Attack (if it has a lot of attacks per round), or both. 
Big creatures could specialize in tripping (especially with reach 
weapons), bull rush, and other attacks that bring their size advantage 
into play. A creature with spell-like abilities should try to Empower or
 Quicken those if possible, and it can use Skill Focus (Concentration) 
or Combat Casting to ensure that it always succeeds in casting 
defensively.</p>
<p align="left">You can get even more feat options from supplements that focus on the type of monster in question, such as <i>Libris Mortis</i> for undead, <i>Draconomicon</i> for big creatures (not just dragons), or the <i>Planar Handbook </i>for
 extraplanar creatures. You could also add bonus feats that emulate 
effects you want. For example, you could give Improved Teamwork (+4 on 
flanking attacks) to pack attackers such as wolves, or Spring Attack to 
leaping predators such as leopards.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 3: Use Terrain to Your Advantage</b></p>
<p align="left">Look at the special terrain rules in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide,</i> as well as <i>Frostburn, Sandstorm, </i>and
 the other terrain books. You can plan some interesting encounters 
around unusual terrain features that are suited to the enemy and the way
 it fights. Such a tactic forces PCs to overcome natural obstacles and 
may prevent them from taking advantage of known monster weaknesses for a
 while. </p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-05%20-%20Challenging%20Knowledgeable%20Players_files/dx1104sg_savemygame_snow.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="213" width="200">To
 plan such an encounter, think about the movement options of the 
creature you plan to use and how it can use position to stymie the 
party. Don't have flying creatures land and enter melee except as a last
 resort. Instead, have the creature snatch up a PC and fly away with 
him, thereby forcing the party to focus (at least temporarily) on rescue
 ahead of victory. Give aquatic creatures enough room not only to swim 
normally, but also to bull rush or grapple enemies into the water. If 
your monster can burrow or climb, think three-dimensionally about the 
space in and around the dungeon corridors where the PCs walk. Finally, 
use cover and concealment to complicate your encounters, and ruthlessly 
enforce any and all penalties relating to position, movement, or 
visibility.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 4: Use Tactical Thinking</b></p>
<p align="left">Not every monster is a tactical genius, but most are 
basically aware of their own abilities and shortcomings, and they 
instinctively know how to fight in ways that maximize their advantages 
and minimize their vulnerabilities. A wise enemy flees from a fight in 
which the conditions are unfavorable and returns when it can set the 
rules of engagement, choose a battleground that is advantageous for 
itself and inconvenient for the opponents, and prepare for combat with 
all the resources at its disposal. Even animals don't necessarily fight 
to the death or attack an obviously greater threat. Instead, they try to
 pick off scouts or stragglers, attack mounts rather than the iron-shod 
warriors on their backs, and harass or menace PCs rather than starting 
an open battle.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solution 5: Use Teamwork</b></p>
<p align="left">The teamwork benefits presented in <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i>
 offer another interesting option for creating surprising encounters. If
 you have multiple monsters that often work together, you can select 
teamwork tactics that can stymie the characters in your campaign -- or 
at least provide their foes with an advantage. Including even low-level 
bards, clerics, or marshals (from the <i>Miniatures Handbook</i>) in enemy forces to rally, exhort, and bless groups of enemies, or uniting a group of foes with a companion spirit (see <i>Dungeon Master's Guide II</i>),
 can also greatly boost the effectiveness of your monster hordes. Even 
simpler tactics for using teamwork were described in an earlier column 
about hitting opponents with high Armor Class values. Use feats such as 
Swarmfighting for multiple small creatures, and coordinate attacks with 
bull rushes to provoke attacks of opportunity or push characters into 
pits or other hazards. Likewise, your monsters can trip foes to give 
allies a better chance of hitting them, and also force the opponents to 
provoke attacks of opportunity just to stand up again.</p>
<p align="left">When designing complex encounters, don't neglect the 
possibility of reinforcements. If the fight takes place in an inhabited 
area, the noise of combat may draw other monsters as well -- either 
random predators or allies of the enemy who have come to lend a hand. 
Bad guys generally have enough sense to set up signals for rallying the 
troops, so a fight against a few guards could easily become a 
large-scale battle if one of them has time to ring the gong and bring 
the rest of the regiment running. When such possibilities exist, give 
some thought to response time, the order in which allies will arrive, 
and what preparations (such as spellcasting) they can make before they 
appear at the scene.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p align="left">Your players won't feel cheated out of their hard-earned
 expertise if you take the fight to them with a little creativity. It's 
even okay to fudge die rolls once in a while if a fight is turning out 
to be too easy, but it's more satisfying for everyone involved if the 
challenge stems from inventiveness rather than just manipulation. Heck, 
your players may even appreciate the fact that the bad guys aren't just 
popping out of the official <i>Monster Manual</i> cloning vats, and that
 they have to exercise their brains a little more. Obviously they enjoy 
tactical thinking, since they've spent so much time memorizing monsters 
and figuring out the standards. By altering the monsters and the 
situations within the legal limits, you're just giving them more food 
for thought and whetting their appetite for the next challenge.</p>
