<h4><i>Problem:</i> Upgrading Magic Items</h4>
<p><i>I'd love to see an article about magic items and the party's 
ability/likelihood to upgrade those magic items from a visit to town. 
The party in my game likes to take shopping trips to large cities, like 
Waterdeep, for the express purpose of upgrading magic items. The rules 
in the DMG are of considerable help when these shopping trips take 
place, but creating magic items seems as much of an art as it is a 
science. There seems to be a certain "fudge factor" that's important to 
magic item creation/upgrades, but doesn't really come across in the DMG.
 For example, the DMG states that a magic item might grant an Insight 
bonus to AC, yet I can't find any specific magic items that grant such a
 bonus. One of the sidebars in the DMG magic item section mentions that 
it would not be fair to allow a character to get a bonus to STR from 
both </i>bull's stength<i> and </i>gauntlets of ogre might.</p>
<p><i>Should players be allowed to upgrade magic items like this? If so,
 are there any hard and fast rules that can be applied (in addition to 
the text of the DMG) that make this process easier for the DM? Any other
 advice about magic item upgrades? Save my game!</i></p>
<p align="right">-- sorites, Wizards message boards</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td> If you're asking for rules that make it easy on 
the DM when it comes to creating and upgrading magic items, you're in 
luck! The magic item creation rules in 3rd Edition <b>D&amp;D</b> are 
light years more organized, intelligible, and systematic than in 
previous versions of the game. In the olden days, it was all about 
researching or discovering (and then collecting) exotic ingredients and 
obscure processes and then engaging in an extremely complex item 
creation process involving high level spells (for wizard-types) or vague
 requirements for prayer and consecration (for divine casters).</td>

upgrades within the context of the DMG. For additional options, you 
might also consider <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/178620000">Weapons of Legacy</a> -- this supplement introduces legacy rituals that unlock the hidden powers of magic items as their owners rise in levels.</td>

 rules now are pretty direct and specific in what you can do and what it
 costs. To upgrade an item, it has to be something that is upgradeable. 
The obvious place for this is weapons and armor -- add a bigger 
enhancement bonus or a special ability. The net cost is equal to the 
total cost of the final item less the cost of whatever enchantments were
 already on it. You can add entirely new abilities to an item, subject 
to the restrictions on what that item could do (e.g., you could not add <i>fireball </i>to the powers of a <i>wand of lightning bolt</i> because, by definition, wands can carry only a single spell. You could, however, add the power to cast <i>fireball</i> to a <i>rod of splendor</i> or a <i>darkskull</i>). The cost of adding powers to items is described in the tables on pp. 284-288 in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>,
 including adjustments that may apply for adding powers to carried items
 (a discount for multiple abilities) versus for worn items (a 50% 
surcharge for extra abilities) or other factors. </p>
<p>While the basic rules are pretty straightforward, a few tips might 
help when dealing wih your excessively clever players and their efforts 
to bend things in their favor. </p>
<p><b>1. No Double-Dipping</b></p>
<p>This rule is simple and direct. Bonuses of the same type overlap and do not stack. You can't benefit from both <i>gauntlets of ogre power</i> and <i>bull's strength</i>
 because both provide an enhancement bonus; the higher bonus supersedes 
the lower. That's why you are not allowed to benefit from both a <i>belt of strength</i> and <i>gauntlets of ogre power</i>. Note that a few obscure spells (e.g., <i>elation</i> from the <i>Book of Exalted Deeds</i> or <i>aura of vitality</i> from the <i>Spell Compendium</i>)
 that give a morale bonus to ability scores rather than an enhancement 
bonus. If you allowed a PC to find or buy an item that gave such a bonus
 on a continuous basis (a word of advice: DON'T!), they could stack. 
These are OK as short-duration (one round/level) spells for temporary 
boosts, but could be highly cheaterous to allow on an essentially 
permanent basis. </p>
<p>Table 7-33 allows characters to create items with save bonuses and AC
 bonuses of nonstandard types (e.g., insight, luck, profane, sacred), 
but not other types of bonuses. It doesn't explicitly state it, but this
 is a good hint that allowing 'exotic' bonuses to other things (such as 
ability scores), even if you can find one or a few oddball exceptions 
where they pop up in the game, is probably not a good idea. </p>
<p><b>2. No Double-Wearing</b></p>
<p>Another simple rule is only one item (or set of items) for each 'body
 slot'. This is pretty clearly spelled out on p. 214 and p. 288. At high
 levels, you may get PCs who want to spend extra cash to make their 
items 'no-slot' items, which doubles the cost (see table 7-33). Yes, 
this means you could wear four sets of bracers or three cloaks, and this
 may violate common sense or at least your aesthetic sense when thinking
 about a PC with a stack of hats and helmets on her head, but it's 
perfectly legal in the rules. It's actually not the most cost-efficient 
thing, though, because in 3.5, adding a second ability to a 
'slot-restricted' item costs only 50% extra, not double as it did in 
3.0. Rather than encouraging PCs to pursue no-slot items, you might 
encourage them to pursue this option instead when they're in town 
getting their upgrades. </p>
<p><b>3. Be Wary of False Limits</b></p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2005-19%20-%20Upgrading%20Magic%20Items,%20Part%201_files/sg_20060519a2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="140" width="200">The <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>
 on p. 282 provides the option to allow discounts in item creation (and 
therefore upgrade) costs by limiting use of the item to characters with a
 certain level of skill or of a certain class or alignment. (You could 
argue the same should be offered if feats are required to use the item.)
 This makes sense, in a way, but it is also a gaping loophole for 
characters to create items that have a specific discount for their 
character ("Hey, what do you know, this item requires a good-aligned 
ranger with at least 10 ranks in Survival -- why that's me! Give me that
 20% discount!"). </p>
<p>Ummm, no. That's the way it's written in the rules, but my suggestion
 is that this rule should apply only when you, the DM, design items for 
general campaign use. To allow this discount for PCs creating their own 
items is like handing out free money. The temptation to fudge it is too 
great. </p>
<p><b>4. Once is Too Often</b></p>
<p>Be careful of PCs who want to add limited-use abilities to their 
stuff. If your campaign works in such a way that only a few combats 
happen each day, those single-use effects are just as good as items you 
can use all the time -- multiple uses are irrelevant when you don't need
 to use them more often. A single, powerful effect can tip the scales in
 a way that frequent, lower-level effects do not. You can, for instance,
 make an item that does a 15th level <i>horrid wilting</i> once per day for less than it would cost to do a 4th level spell (7th level caster) such as<i> enervation </i>at
 will. There are advantages to the lower-level, frequent-use item, but 
when they beat the main villain's SR and wipe him out in one shot with a
 <i>finger of death </i>instead of having their lower-level <i>lightning bolts </i>and such shrugged off by energy resistance or SR, it gets pretty annoying. </p>
<p>The same phenomenon occurs when creating a staff with higher-level effects that cost multiple charges. A staff that does <i>circle of death </i>at a cost of 10 charges costs about the same as a <i>wand of flaming sphere</i>;
 you can do the latter 50 times instead of just five before you run out 
of charges, but the difference in effectiveness is obvious. </p>
<p>The rules are there for a reason, but consider adjusting the cost 
modifier for infrequent use items. The ideas outlined above are some of 
the major loopholes or concerns to watch out for when thinking about 
upgrading (or creating) magic items. We will continue this subject in 
more depth next time.</p>
