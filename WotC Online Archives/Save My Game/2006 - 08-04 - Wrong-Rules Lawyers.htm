<p>This column provides advice for DMs whose campaigns are in trouble. 
Do your players constantly bicker or complain about issues both inside 
and outside of the main campaign action? Do your best ideas fall flat? 
Have you set up a situation that you now wish you hadn't? Worry no more,
 because Jason Nelson-Brown has the answers to save your game!</p>
<h4><i>Problem:</i> Players Who Don't Understand the Rules</h4>
<p><i>Recently we have been playing with a group of random people we 
found living near each other. Now we are deep into sessions and it has 
come to this, it seems that some of the players don't have any knowledge
 or lack of knowledge in D&amp;D and continue to think they do. It we 
get into stupid arguments like rulings on Ambidexerity in 3.5....?? Any 
suggestions on how to handle this?</i></p>
<p align="right">-- Andrew, AskWizards.com</p>
<p>Sure. Find a new group.</p>
<p>Seriously, a lot of the questions we receive could be answered with 
the 'vote with your feet' response, but ultimately that's not a very 
productive response. That means you need to find a new group (that's 
looking for a new player), your old group needs to find a replacement 
player, and nobody really learns anything from the experience. If you 
want to actually address the problem, then here are some ideas.</p>
<p>First, I don't know who "we" are in this question; presumably you and
 some other(s). Does this mean that the concerns you raise are shared 
among multiple members of the group, rather than just yourself? The 
concern isn't diminished if it is only yours -- as Gandhi said, "You may
 be a minority of one, but the truth is the truth." Accomplishing change
 is easier, however, when you have allies who also see the problem the 
way you do.</p>
<p>I have another problem understanding the situation, though, because 
you state you are gaming with a group of random people. What does that 
mean? Were they a group before you met them, or did the group come into 
existence only at the point when you (yourself as well as the group as a
 whole) began gaming together? Are they well known to one another but 
seem random to you? Did you all just come together with no one knowing 
any of the others? Gaming groups can be like that, especially if you met
 electronically and arranged the game that way before actually getting 
together in person.</p>
<p>The relevance of the question is that if you are coming into a group 
that is already in existence, you may have to lay some of your 
preferences aside as you become part of the group and accommodate their 
norms. If, on the other hand, the group coalesced around the game 
without historical precedents, you should have been able to establish 
the structure of the game in a way that was mutually agreeable.</p>
<p><img src="2006%20-%2008-04%20-%20Wrong-Rules%20Lawyers_files/sg_20060804a_book.jpg" alt="I know that rule is in here somewhere ..." title="I know that rule is in here somewhere ..." align="right" border="0" height="250" width="250">Maybe
 the problem is that it all seemed fine at first, but it was only 
through the course of playing that you realized you were gaming with 
idiots. The worst kind of idiot is the one who doesn't know he is an 
idiot or even thinks he's quite knowledgeable. The best solution is to 
educate the ignorant. There should not be a conversation about 
ambidexterity in 3.5, because that feat doesn't exist in 3.5. This isn't
 a point for argument -- it's a simple fact. You get out the <i>Player's Handbook </i>and you show them where the feat should be -- but <b>it's not there!</b> Better still, if you have a 3.0 <i>Player's Handbook, </i>you can compare and contrast the differences. You can also download the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20030718a">free conversion guide PDF</a>
 and walk them through the changes. The document shows what rules were 
added, subtracted, modified, or melded together with other things. This 
has nothing to do with opinion, taste, or preference. It's what's there 
in black and white.</p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily stop the conversation, but it moves it to a 
different place. If after shoving the rulebook in their faces 
(figuratively or maybe even literally) and proving that you are right 
and they are wrong, they may still keep arguing about it, but then 
you're not really arguing anymore. At that point you may as well be 
trying to explain physics to a lemon.</p>
<p>Now the approach I have just suggested is confrontational, which is 
on purpose. What you really are asking for is permission not to argue 
but to assert, to demonstrate the rightness of your way of thinking and 
the wrongness of theirs. The rules are there and you want them to be 
used. It's like 2+2=4. That's not up for debate or argument, it just is.</p>
<p>It may be that your compatriots have come from a 3.0 background (or 
even from other games, whether newer d20-based systems or any of a 
zillion older games with all kinds of mechanics), and you want to play 
3.5. That's a separate conversation, because the problem may be that 
neither of you is 'right' (or more correctly, that both of you are 
right) but that you are arguing from different premises. The other 
gamers think they're playing 3.0 and you are messing it up, and you 
think you're playing 3.5 and they are the ones with a problem. So before
 you start throwing books around the table, make sure to have the 
initial conversation that sets the terms of the debate. What are we 
playing here, and do we all understand and have the right books for it?</p>
<p>You also want to be careful asserting errata as rules, because not 
every gamer scrutinizes this website on a regular basis looking for rule
 fixes. There may be rules out there, official errata or not, that some 
folks in the group may have never heard of.</p>
<p>Of course, in a game such as <i>D&amp;D</i>, the black and white in 
the rulebook is never the final answer. Rule Zero is the real final 
answer. The rules interpretation or house rule is the one the DM makes 
and sticks to and the one that applies. What you need to do, if you 
value continuing to game in this group, is to make sure everyone 
understands which set of written rules, web errata, printed optional 
rules, and in-group house rules are being used. It may be that 
communication is as big a problem here as simple ignorance, and it may 
be that you won't come to an agreement on how the game is to be played. 
In that case, the group is destined to split, but that should be your 
last resort, not your first option.</p>
