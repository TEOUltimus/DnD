<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">"Well,"
 said Fira to no one in particular, "it seemed like a good idea at the 
time." The nausea was slowly fading, allowing her to take stock of the 
situation. A few minutes before, she had stepped through the strange 
portal back in the Tower of Ankurra, thinking that it would lead to 
another part of the fortress that she had already infiltrated. Much to 
her surprise, the circular obsidian archway did not open up into the 
inner sanctum. Instead, the sunrod in her hand revealed that she was in a
 large cave, with several tunnels leading off into darkness. Behind her,
 where the archway should have been, stood a sheet of smooth marble.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">She
 had no idea where she was; the portal had sent her . . . somewhere. She
 could not even begin to guess where "somewhere" was. Fira made a mental
 note to stick a blade -- no, two -- into the fat belly of that gnome 
who had provided her with the map of the Tower of Ankurra. He was 
probably in their employ and she scolded herself for being so gullible.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">She
 searched in the gloom for almost an hour, trying to ascertain whether 
the portal was still there. Her hand smacked nothing but solid rock. 
"Ah, Olidamarra," Fira chuckled. "You must be laughing at me right now."
 Finding nothing of note, she picked one of the tunnels at random and 
slowly crept through the darkness. The tunnel dipped and curved without 
warning -- it looked natural, but she could make out telltale signs of 
the stone being worked. It had an odd texture, however, as it if had 
been <i>chewed</i> out. Great. Who knows what could be down here?</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Fira
 lost track of how long she had wandered through the tunnel. Her knees 
were scraped and bloody; her head throbbed from the numerous times she 
cracked it against a low overhang. A low rushing sound, like a waterfall
 was barely perceptible in the depths of the tunnel. Emboldened at the 
thought of finding an underground river that she might be able to 
navigate, Fira pressed on.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">The
 rushing sound grew louder and all around her. She paused in confusion: 
Unless she was wrong, she should have reached the water by now. She sat 
down, exhaustion and a rising sense of panic beginning to overtake her. 
She was lost, hungry, and thirsty . . . and water was somewhere nearby. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Something
 had burrowed through the tunnel behind her and plopped onto her armor. 
She jumped and swatted it away. In the bright glare of the sunrod, it 
looked like a beautiful diamond. She instinctively reached down to pick 
up the gem, when it suddenly sprouted legs and scurried toward her. She 
shrieked and drew her sword in a flash. A moment later, she knew what 
the source of the rushing noise was. A torrent of gemlike beetles poured
 from a hole in the wall, leaving behind a slick, glassy layer on the 
surface of the stone. Fira dropped the sunrod and slashed wildly at the 
swarm as it crawled up her legs. She turned to run back up the tunnel 
she'd come from, but found herself rooted in place, her feet encased in 
the same crystalline substance. Her sword flailed around without effect 
until the swarm of crystal beetles reached her arms and froze them in 
place. Fira's screams ended moments later when her head was finally 
encased. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;">Fira
 could see perfectly through the clear crystal, though she couldn't tell
 that the swarm had stopped moving after it finished entombing her. For a
 few fleeting seconds, Fira thought that she could crack out of the 
layer -- until intense burning consumed her. Even had someone been 
standing beside her, Fira's last screams could not have been heard 
through the crystal that slowly dissolved her into an indistinct mush.</span></p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Crystal
 beetles are ubiquitous fist-sized vermin that primarily dwell on the 
Plane of Earth. They fulfill a similar ecological niche as many other 
burrowing insects do on the Material Plane -- churning through rock and 
turning it into rich soil. Their name derives from their crystal-like 
carapace, which shines and scintillates on the rare occasions when light
 shines upon them. It is transparent, allowing the viewer to see the 
organs inside the beetle's body. The shell of a crystal beetle is made 
from a hard, transparent substance that resembles a diamond or rock 
crystal. Some swarms find their way to the Material Plane, where they 
will happily feast on veins of ore and gems, as well as any hapless 
creatures that blunder into their path. Certain creatures native to the 
Plane of Earth, such as xorns and umber hulks, find crystal beetles 
delicious (if dangerous) food and gorge on swarms when they find them.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Crystal
 beetles feed upon stone, earth, and gemstones. To help them digest such
 tough matter, they exude a crystalline substance that releases a 
powerful acid. In a matter of minutes, the stone is reduced to a more 
palatable goo that they feast upon. Crystal beetles apparently have a 
"sweet tooth" when it comes to living creatures -- a swarm of crystal 
beetles will overrun a creature, encase it in crystal, and feed upon the
 remains. Such a rare treat will draw nearby swarms, which will 
completely cover the victim in hope of gaining a taste. The sound of a 
crystal beetle swarm burrowing through the stone sounds like a rush of 
water.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Despite
 its resemblance to gemstone, the crystal beetle has no value other than
 as a curiosity. If a lone beetle becomes separated from the rest of the
 swarm, it dies in 1d6 days and slowly disintegrate from its own 
internal acid (causing no damage).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Combat</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Crystal
 beetles attempt to overrun a creature and encase it in a crystal. The 
swarm surrounds its target for at least three rounds, creating a very 
thick layer, before waiting for the acid to reduce the victim to mush.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Vermin Traits:</b>
 A crystal beetle swarm is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms,
 compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It also has 
darkvision (60-foot range).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Swarm Traits (Ex): </b>Not
 subject to critical hits or flanking. Immune to mind-affecting spells. 
Immune to damage from all weapons. Immune to single-target spells. 
Vulnerable to area effects. Does not threaten nearby squares.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Distraction (Ex): </b>Any
 nonmindless creature vulnerable to the swarm's damage that begins its 
turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude 
save (DC 16) negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells
 within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + 
spell level). Using skills involving patience and concentration requires
 a Concentration check (DC 20).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Acid (Ex):</b> The swarm attack of a crystal beetle swarm deals 2d6 points of acid damage in addition to the normal damage of its bite.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Encase (Ex):</b>
 A crystal beetle swarm has the ability to encase a creature in a 
crystal-like substance that breaks down its victim with acid. A creature
 that has been swarmed for two consecutive rounds must make a Reflex 
save (DC 17) encased in a layer of tough, crystal-like substance exuded 
from the crystal beetle swarm. The encased creature is held motionless, 
unable to move or attack, until it escapes. An encased creature can make
 a Strength check (DC 15) to break out of the layer and takes no acid 
damage that turn if successful. An ally can break loose an encased 
creature, with a Strength check (DC 20); the material proves slightly 
easier to break from the inside (a matter of leverage). Each additional 
round of encasement thickens the layer, increasing the Break check DC by
 +5 per additional round.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 crystal-like substance releases acidic enzymes that cause 2d6 points of
 acid damage per round to the creature trapped inside. Once the creature
 is reduced to -10 hit points, it completely dissolves into pinkish 
mush. The crystal beetles then burrow through the encased layer to feast
 upon the remains. In addition, the encased creature begins to suffocate
 after 2 rounds (see the Drowning Rule in Chapter 3 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Swarm Traits:</b>
 A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernible anatomy, so it is
 not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny 
creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm 
composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Reducing
 a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm to break up, though 
damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or 
resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by
 damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and 
they cannot grapple another.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>),
 with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an 
Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a -10 penalty on 
saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as 
many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area attack does 
not allow a saving throw, a swarm takes double damage instead.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a <i>gust of wind</i>
 spell. To determine the effect of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a
 creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. For example, a 
swarm of Abyss ants (Diminutive creatures) can be blown away by a severe
 wind. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of subdual damage to the swarm per 
spell level (or Hit Die of the originating creature, in the case of 
effects such as an air elemental's whirlwind). A swarm that takes 
subdual damage sufficient to exceed its current hit points becomes 
disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its current hit 
points exceed its subdual damage.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Tremorsense (Ex):</b> A crystal beetle swarm can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground.</span></p>
