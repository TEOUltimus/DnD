<p class="size2">The terrible news of Oakmoss's fate reached me in Bell 
Town, some five leagues away. The entire village had been burned to the 
ground. Apparently, the raiders hadn't been much for taking slaves -- 
they killed everyone they saw. One or two survivors might return to the 
site, but I expected to find the whole area lifeless, with everything of
 value gone and no one to call it a village anymore.</p>
<p class="size2">Except, of course, for things that use the dead for 
their own purposes. Those monstrosities couldn't resist the 
freshly-killed corpses staring lifeless into the sky.</p>
<p class="size2">I left for Oakmoss immediately. I was, at that time, 
lucky enough to be traveling the countryside by coach. As we drove, I 
studied my notes about what might lurk in the area.</p>
<p class="size2">Oakmoss was a coastal fishing village near a small 
inland lake. A stretch of cliffs a short walk from the village were 
riddled with small, shallow caves. I knew what I would be facing: the 
gutpuppet.</p>
<p class="size2">The gutpuppet is a small, devilish creature born on 
this plane. It has developed its necromanical desires into a way of 
life, using corpses to propagate itself. Whereas a fly will merely 
implant eggs into a corpse and leave, letting its offspring use the 
corpse as nourishment, the gutpuppet instead crawls entirely inside a 
corpse then uses it to walk it around, spreading small nodules shaped 
like spikes and akin to seeds as it walks. A clear ichor that serves to 
accelerate the growth of its nodules accompanies the spikes.</p>
<p class="size2">When not in a corpse, the gutpuppet is an ungangly lump
 of muscle and short tubing, looking not unlike a human heart. Instead 
of having a cluster of tubes at one end like a heart, one-inch 
prehensile tubes protrude from all sides. It moves by rolling and using 
its tubes as a grotesque steering mechanism. Since it's quite muscular, 
it can move much quicker than it looks like it should.</p>
<p class="size2">Upon encountering a humanoid or animal corpse, the 
creature crawls into the lifeless chest through the victim's mouth and 
extends tendrils to deliver its horrible ichor. It takes over the 
victim's circulatory system and floods the body with its own fluids. 
This process happens quickly, usually taking no more than three or four 
minutes. The gutpuppet flushes out the corpse's fluids to make room for 
its own. This is a particularly violent and gory process: Witnesses 
report seeing the heaving chest of a dead body, a wet, ragged 
breathing-like sound coming from the mouth, then a sudden gout of blood 
bursting from every opening of the body accompanied by a violent, 
grotesque, lifelike twitching.</p>
<p class="size2">It's quite possible to mistake a dead body in this 
condition for someone in some kind of acute distress. Woe, however, to 
the person who tries to lend assistance.</p>
<p class="size2">Once the gutpuppet is firmly attached inside the body, 
has flushed all the body's blood and other fluids out, and filled it 
with its own, it's ready to "walk the corpse." On its own, the gutpuppet
 is very slow, but it can walk a corpse easily -- sometimes moving 
faster than the original owner could. To aid the appearance of being 
just an ordinary living creature, the gutpuppet washes itself in streams
 and steals fresh clothing when possible.</p>
<p class="size2">Corpses under the control of a gutpuppet do not 
resemble zombies or most other undead. First, they do not smell as bad 
as other forms of undead, as the gutpuppet's fluid prevents flesh and 
connective tissue from decaying any more than it already has. Second, 
the intruder moves the host body quickly, more quickly than undead 
typically move. Third, the corpse's flesh takes on a particularly 
strange pallor. It's not pale -- certainly not leathery by any means -- 
but is rather glassy. Such a complexion could be mistaken for a healthy 
one under the right circumstances, especially on nights with a bright 
moon. In addition, host bodies profusely sweat the toxin from every 
pore. This effect, more than anything, can lead someone to mistake a 
walking corpse for something living. (I, for one, have never encountered
 another form of undead that can sweat.) Combine this ability with the 
chest that never stops heaving (as the gutpuppet pushes fluid around the
 corpse) and the intermittent, ragged, breathing-like sounds coming from
 the mouth, and one can see how a humanoid corpse might make some 
distance into civilized areas before being discovered as something not 
really alive.</p>
<p class="size2">A gutpuppet's shell body is easy to track, since every 
step it takes leaves behind a sweaty footprint. The fluid proves toxic 
to flesh, but has no effect on other organic material besides making it 
wet (and remaining toxic to flesh until it evaporates).</p>
<p class="size2">When a gutpuppet traveling inside a corpse encounters 
another dead body (nearly anything will do), it "spits" one of its 
spikes into the body. The spike injects fluid into the corpse, and the 
spike itself slowly burrows into the body, toward the heart, then grows.
 Within two days, a new gutpuppet fills the chest of the corpse, 
animates the body, and walks around searching for dead bodies on its 
own.</p>
<p class="size2">Gutpuppets do not seek to kill living creatures and try
 to avoid them. However, they are drawn to blood and, like vultures, 
seek out living things they sense may die. If attacked, they won't 
hesitate to defend themselves, spitting spikes at opponents.</p>
<p class="size2">The gutpuppet can sustain a corpse for up to a month. 
While its fluid prevents the decay of muscle and connective tissue, the 
gutpuppet must eat. The corpse itself is the most convenient source of 
food, so it nibbles slowly on the inner flesh. Once the body has ceased 
to be of use, the gutpuppet crawls out through the most accessible 
opening and inches away, looking for other bodies. Naturally, the beasts
 are attracted to battlefields and the enormous pickings to be found 
there. However, the gutpuppet is keen to pick bodies that are intact. 
Any gross openings in the skin will allow too much of its fluid to leak 
out. Therefore, a gutpuppet is more likely to pick a body that has died 
from blunt trauma than from, say, being hacked to death. It prefers 
animals and people that have died from sickness. If it cannot find a 
corpse, it chooses some place to wait until it smells a corpse. (It can 
smell a dead body from up to a mile away.) It prefers moist hiding 
places; ideal locations include coastal caves, since they're dark and 
wet, and stagnant lakes. During the night, it may sometimes roam the 
countryside if it is desperate enough. </p>

<p class="size2"><b>Special Attacks</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b></b><b>Fluidic Burst (Ex):</b> The gutpuppet 
typically walks around bloated, its many sacs filled with the necrotic 
poison it uses to animate dead bodies (see below). However, the fluid 
does not need to enter a body to cause damage -- mere contact is enough 
to harm. Whenever the gutpuppet sustains five or more points of damage 
from a single blow, one of its sacs ruptures, spewing fluid in a 10-foot
 burst in the direction from which the damage came. A Reflex save (DC 
15) avoids contact with the poison. Anyone coming into contact with it 
suffers 1d10 points of temporary Strength damage unless he or she makes a
 successful Fortitude save (DC 17). Attackers are subject to this effect
 whether the gutpuppet is in or out of a host body since the fluid is 
under such high pressure. Note that a corpse with a gutpuppet inside it 
also sweats the poison, making contact with the corpse's skin dangerous.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Necrotic Poison (Ex):</b> The gutpuppet's spikes 
inject a fluid that helps the creature animate dead flesh. But when 
injected into living tissue, this fluid immediately begins to liquefy 
the living tissue with which it comes into contact. During the first 
round of injection, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 17) 
or suffer 1d10 points of damage, 1d8 points of permanent Strength 
damage, and succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 17) or fall unconscious from
 the extreme pain that burns through the entire body including the 
brain. Secondary damage (see Poison on pages 79-80 of the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11551">Dungeon Maste</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11551">r's Guide</a></i>) is the same.</p>
<p class="size2">Unfortunately for the gutpuppet, injected fluid 
destroys the inner tissue it comes into contact with, rendering the 
victim useless as a host corpse, as the monster needs functioning muscle
 tissue in order to walk bodies. Someone who dies from being injected 
with the poison is rendered unusable as a corpse. Standing fluid is also
 toxic; anyone touching it suffers 1d10 points of temporary Strength 
damage unless a successful Fortitude save (DC 17) is made. Strength 
returns at a rate of 1 point per day. There is no secondary damage from 
touching standing gutpuppet fluid.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spike Spit (Ex):</b> The gutpuppet uses the mouth of
 the host body as a convenient opening through which to "spit" spikes at
 living creatures. Each spike carries a dose of necrotic poison (as 
described above).</p>
<p class="size2"><b> Special Qualities</b></p>
<p class="size2"><b>Corpse Armor (Ex):</b> When the gutpuppet is nestled
 inside a chest, it uses the surrounding dead flesh as protection. This 
tactic results in damage reduction of 2/--. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Walk Corpse (Ex):</b> When not inside a corpse, the 
gutpuppet has a speed of 5. When in a corpse and animating it, the 
creature moves at a speed of 40.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills and Feats:</b> The gutpuppet has a racial bonus of +4 on Intuit Direction and Listen checks. It receives Track as a bonus feat.</p>
