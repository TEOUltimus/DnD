<p class="size2">Standing high in the branches of an enormous oak tree, 
Evaine peered off in the distance. Smoke from dozens of fires blackened 
the sky, indicating that the orc armada had finally arrived in Blackleaf
 Forest. From the number of fires and reports sent back to him by 
various animals, there seemed to be hundreds, maybe even a thousand, of 
the foul creatures.</p>
<p class="size2">Evaine knew that most of the elves and gnomes who lived
 in that portion of the forest were already dead or enslaved. There was 
no one left who could fend off the horde . . .or so the orcs thought. 
Although he was loath to call upon him, Evaine knew there was one entity
 who could bring the orc invasion to an end. He would have to awaken the
 Great Sleeper.</p>
<p class="size2">He easily slid down the side of the oak and padded to a
 staggeringly tall tree in the distance. Although the forest floor lay 
thick with dried leaves from the approaching fall, Evaine made no sound 
at all. Eventually, he entered an open grove that was home to the Great 
Sleeper.</p>
<p class="size2">Knowing that time was of the essence, Evaine sang a 
chant to the great tree. For hours, he called and sang at the top of his
 voice, asking the Great Sleeper to awaken. He pounded on the thick bark
 and stamped his feet on gnarled roots. He watched intently, and was 
eventually rewarded by seeing the outlines of facial features move 
within the bark. Two huge lids opened, and eyes the color of sap turned 
their gaze toward the druid.</p>
<p class="size2">"I hear you, woodsman," rumbled the elder treant, its 
voice sounding like the cracking and creaking of branches. "Why have you
 awakened me?"</p>
<p class="size2">In slow, patient words, Evaine explained the threat of 
orc invasion against the forest. When finished, he sat down and rested, 
knowing that it could take hours for the immense treant to respond. To 
his surprise, the treant responded after only twenty minutes.</p>
<p class="size2">"This must not happen," boomed the treant. "I will 
awaken my children to protect our home." Suddenly the ground trembled as
 the elder treant pulled up its roots. Four enormous branchlike arms 
rose in the air. Evaine felt that the entire forest was shaking apart. 
He realized that other treants and normal trees were coming to life.</p>
<p class="size2">With a grim smile, Evaine knew that there was no place for the orcs to hide. Not when the forest itself was alive....</p>

<p class="size2">Although most humanoids believe that treants are among 
the most ancient creatures in the world, few realize that there are even
 older and stronger such creatures that live for tens of thousands of 
years. Elder treants are the undisputed rulers of treantkind and firm 
defenders of the forests. Elves, druids, rangers, and other 
forest-lovers also revere them. </p>
<p class="size2">Elder treants are awesome to behold, towering above 
even some of the largest oak trees in the forest. Only rare species of 
redwoods have reached taller heights. Like normal treants, they combine 
the features of trees and humans, although it is difficult to discern 
their facial features with a casual glance. Their faces are kind, but 
ancient beyond compare, suggesting a wizened crone or sage. Their bark 
is scarred and blackened from occasional lightning strikes, and thickly 
covered with moss.</p>
<p class="size2">Because of their tremendous life spans, elder treants 
think incredibly slowly. They spend most of their time in deep 
meditation and communion with the forest around them. Unlike normal 
treants, elder treants care little about concepts like good or evil, and
 seldom go out of their way to provide assistance or hindrance. They are
 difficult to awaken from their thoughts, but terrible beyond compare 
when angered.</p>
<p class="size2">Like treants, elder treants fear nothing save fire. 
Their incredibly tough bark can withstand most normal blazes, accepting 
it as a part of nature. However, they detest any species that uses fire 
as a weapon -- those who burn and rape the woods without thought. Elder 
treants have been known to animate entire groves to seek revenge on 
nearby communities that use fire indiscriminately and destroy part of 
the forest.</p>
<p class="size2">Elder treants speak Treant, plus Common, Elven, and Sylvan. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>COMBAT</b></p>
<p class="size2">Elder treants dislike moving at all and will uproot 
themselves only when things turn dire. They observe their foes carefully
 and use<i> control plant, entangle, </i>and<i> wall of thorns</i> to hinder or dissuade opponents from approaching. </p>
<p class="size2">If that tactic does not work, an elder treant first 
sends out animated trees, then treants, to deal with problems. Only when
 all of these tactics fail do elder treants pull themselves out of the 
ground to attack. They strike with two enormous branchlike claws that 
can inflict horrific damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>entangle, plant growth, command plants, control plants</i>. 3/day -- <i>wall of thorns. </i>Caster level 20th; save DC 14 + spell level.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Trample (Ex):</b> As a standard action during its 
turn each round, an elder treant can literally run over opponents at 
least one size category smaller than itself. This attack deals 4d12+22 
points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an 
attack of opportunity at a -4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 42) for half 
damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Animate Trees</i> (Sp):</b> An elder treant can 
animate trees within 1 mile at will, controlling up to 12 trees at a 
time. It takes a full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. 
Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 and fights as a treant in all 
respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant who 
animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is 
otherwise similar to <i>liveoak</i> as cast by a 20th-level druid.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Bolster Treants</i> (Sp):</b> Once per day, an 
elder treant can lend some of its enormous energy to all treants and 
animated trees within 1 mile, gaining a +4 to attack rolls and saving 
throws. In addition, treants and animated trees do triple damage against
 objects instead of double.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Vulnerability (Ex):</b> An elder treant or 
animated tree takes double damage from fire attacks unless the attack 
allows a save, in which case it takes double damage on a failure and no 
damage on a success.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Half damage from Piercing (Ex):</b> Piercing weapons deal only half damage to elder treants, with a minimum of 1 point of damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Plant Traits (Ex):</b> An elder treant is immune to poison, <i>sleep,</i>
 paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to critical 
hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature also has low-light vision.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Triple Damage against Objects (Ex):</b> An elder treant who makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills: </b>Elder treants receive skills and feats 
as though they were fey*. They have a +20 racial bonus to Hide checks 
made in forested areas.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>TREANT SOCIETY</b></p>
<p class="size2">Elder treants hail from a different era, when all 
species lived in harmony with their surroundings. Eventually (some say 
with the elder treants' aid), other trees evolved into normal treants. 
The elder treants treated these new creatures like their own offspring 
and charged them with watching over and protecting the forest.</p>
<p class="size2">Treants have tremendous respect and admiration for 
elder treants. They defer to them in almost every respect and will do 
everything, including lay down their own lives, to protect them from 
harm.</p>
<p class="size2">Regular treants do not turn into elder treants through 
size and age; elder treants are a different creature altogether. A few 
normal treants tower over the elders. </p>
