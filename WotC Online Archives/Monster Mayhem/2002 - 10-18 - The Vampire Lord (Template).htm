<p class="size2">In the machinations of vampires, the undead creatures 
vie against the living and against each other. Power is all, and the 
accumulation of power is the goal of these foul beings. Sometimes they 
rise up against their creators; on rare occasions they succeed in 
breaking the iron control of their "master" and slay it. These creatures
 can go beyond the normal vampire, and become an even more vile and 
horrible undead: a vampire lord. Few are ever seen, or recognized if 
seen. Possessing few of the weaknesses of their lesser kindred, they 
walk among mortals with little fear of discovery. They are the rulers of
 vampire communities. In a world where vampire conclaves battle against 
each other, the vampire lords play chess with their lesser kindred.</p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lords are those few vampires who meet a strict 
set of requirements. They each have lived as a vampire for at least 100 
years, and have acquired 10 or more class levels or Hit Dice. They tend 
to possess levels of arcane spellcasting classes, but not always. A 
vampire lord was formerly a vampire under the control of another vampire
 (not a vampire lord) and has slain its creator. Further, the vampire 
lord must have created at least 10 vampires and survived an 
assassination attempt by one of its subjects before achieving vampire 
lord status.</p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lords are few and far between, and each is 
fiercely territorial. They know that run-of-the-mill vampires cannot 
match their power, but another vampire lord is a definite threat. As 
they gain power, they become more arrogant towards those they believe 
pose no threat, and more fearful of any real threat to their continued 
existence. Thus, if a vampire lord arises in the territory of another, 
the newcomer is driven away or destroyed as quickly as possible. Vampire
 lords command hundreds of undead servants throughout their vast 
territories, and can have legions of vampire servants at their beck and 
call.</p>
<p class="size2">Unlike normal vampires, a vampire lord does not look 
the least bit unusual. It looks exactly like it did when alive and in 
the peak of health. It has lost the pale, hardened, almost feral look of
 the vampire. A vampire lord always surrounds itself with wealth and 
opulence, but it never forgets that the opulence is a by-product of 
power, not the primary goal.</p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lords speak any languages they knew in life or learned as a vampire.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Creating a Vampire Lord</b></p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lord is a template that can be applied to any 
humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature with a character level of at 
least 10 that has already had the vampire template applied to it 
(hereafter referred to as the "base vampire"). So, make a vampire, and 
then apply this template to it. The creature uses all the special 
abilities of the base vampire, except as noted below.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Dice</b>: Same as base vampire, then add +1 hit point per level or HD of the base vampire</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Speed</b>: Same as base vampire, plus vampire lords can fly with speed 50 ft. and perfect maneuverability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>AC</b>: The base vampire's natural armor bonus improves by +6.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Attacks</b>: Same as base vampire.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special Attacks</b>: A vampire lord retains all the 
special abilities of the base vampire, except as modified below, and 
also gains those noted below. The saving throw, where applicable, is 10 +
 1/2 the vampire lord's class and nonclass HD + the vampire lord's 
Charisma modifier, unless noted otherwise.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Domination (Su)</i>: As base vampire, except that a 
vampire lord can do this either by gaze or voice. It does not require 
line of sight to the target, but the target must be able to hear the 
vampire lord's voice when it speaks at a normal volume level.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Energy Drain (Su)</i>: As base vampire, but a living creature hit by a vampire lord's slam attack takes 3 negative levels.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Blood Drain (Su)</i>: As base vampire, but a vampire
 lord's blood drain inflicts 1d4+2 points of Constitution drain each 
round the pin is maintained.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special Qualities</b>: The vampire lord retains all 
the special qualities of the base vampire, except as modified below, and
 gains those listed below.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Alternate Form (Su)</i>: A vampire lord can assume the form of any animal, as the druid ability <i>wild shape</i>
 used by a 12th-level druid. The vampire lord can use this power at will
 as a move-equivalent action. The vampire lord can change from one 
animal shape to another without having to revert to its humanoid form.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Children of the Night (Su)</i>: As base vampire, but
 the creatures summoned forth serve the vampire lord until released. 
Further, the vampire lord can sense through the senses of any such 
commanded creatures, and communicate empathically with them, to a range 
of 10 miles.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Control Weather (Sp)</i>: A vampire lord can cast either <i>control weather</i> or <i>fog cloud</i> as a 12th-level sorcerer at will.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Create Spawn (Su)</i>: As base vampire, but vampire 
lords create only vampire slaves, never vampire spawn. The new vampire 
is enslaved to the vampire lord until its master's death, and the 
willpower of the vampire lord is too strong to allow it to break free of
 its enslavement.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Damage Reduction (Ex)</i>: A vampire lord is extremely tough; it has damage reduction 10/+3.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Fast Healing (Ex)</i>: As base vampire, but a 
vampire lord heals 8 hit points each round so long as it has at least 1 
hit point. It has 24 hours to reach a place of rest (rather than 2 
hours) if brought to zero hit points. A vampire lord can have many 
places of rest prepared, since the only requirement is some soil from 
its homeland (the place where the base vampire was born).</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Telekinesis (Su)</i>: A vampire lord can use <i>telekinesis</i> (caster level 12th) at will.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Telepathy (Su)</i>: A vampire lord can communicate 
telepathically with any living creature within 100 feet that has a 
language, and with any vampire under its direct control to a range of 1 
mile.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Turn Resistance (Ex)</i>: As base vampire +4 (see <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11552">Monster Manual</a></i>).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Saves</b>: Same as the base vampire, plus the 
vampire lord applies its Charisma modifier to all saving throws in 
addition to its other ability modifiers (as a paladin does).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Abilities</b>: Increase from the base vampire as 
follows: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As undead creatures, 
vampire lords have no Constitution scores.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills</b>: A vampire lord receives an additional +4
 racial bonus to Scry and Sense Motive checks, and a +8 racial bonus to 
Diplomacy and Intimidate checks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Feats</b>: Vampire lords gain Iron Will and Leadership as bonus feats, assuming the base vampire does not already have these feats.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Climate/Terrain</b>: Any land or underground</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Organization</b>: Solitary</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Challenge Rating</b>: Same as base vampire +3</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Treasure</b>: Quadruple standard</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Alignment</b>: Any evil. In the transformation from 
vampire to vampire lord, the creature recovers the Law-Neutral-Chaos 
bent of the original creature. Thus, a Lawful Neutral monk who becomes a
 vampire turns Chaotic Evil, and when it becomes a vampire lord it turns
 Lawful Evil.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Advancement</b>: By character class</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Vampire Lord Weaknesses</b></p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lords have far fewer weaknesses than normal vampires, a benefit of their quest for power.</p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lords cannot be repelled by garlic or holy 
symbols, though they can be turned. Mere presentation of a holy symbol 
has no effect. They have no fear of mirrors, and they cast reflections 
as living beings do.</p>
<p class="size2">Vampire lords can cross over or through running water 
with no impediments. They are not harmed in any way by immersion in 
running water.</p>
<p class="size2">A vampire lord is not as vulnerable to sunlight as a 
normal vampire, and can go about in broad daylight if it desires. Under 
sunlight, it takes a -4 penalty to all ability scores and on all 
attacks, saves, and skill checks. Also, a vampire lord in sunlight 
cannot use any of its supernatural powers. Victims of its domination 
power are not freed of the vampire lord's control during daylight hours;
 the vampire lord can verbally command any creature in its thrall even 
in direct sunlight. Spells that produce sunlight effects cannot harm a 
vampire lord; only direct light from the sun can weaken it. If the 
vampire lord is destroyed while exposed to direct sunlight, it seems to 
die, but unless the body is disposed of as described below, it assumes 
gaseous form as soon as the sun sets and attempts to return to its 
coffin.</p>
<p class="size2">A vampire lord is not killed outright by a wooden stake
 driven through its heart, though the stake does cause normal damage if 
it can bypass the creature's damage reduction.</p>
<p class="size2">The only way to make sure that a vampire lord does not 
return is to cut its head from its body, burn the body and the head 
separately, scatter the ashes from the body over running water, immerse 
the ashes from the head in holy water, and bury the immersed ashes in 
consecrated ground. However, if the head ashes are ever unearthed and 
somehow separated from the holy water, dried thoroughly, and then 
subjected to an <i>unhallow</i> spell, the vampire lord can regenerate in a week if the ashes are placed inside one of its places of rest.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sample Vampire Lord</b></p>
<p class="size2">This example uses a 10-level female human wizard vampire as the base vampire.</p>

<tr><td colspan="2">
<p class="size2"><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> The vampire lord can suck 
blood from a living victim with her fangs by making a successful grapple
 check. If she pins the foe, she drains blood, inflicting 1d4+2 points 
of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Domination (Su): </b>The vampire lord can crush an 
opponent's will just by looking into his or her eyes or speaking. This 
ability is similar to a gaze attack, except that it does not require 
line of sight to the target, the vampire lord must take a standard 
action, the range is 30 feet, and those merely looking at her are not 
affected. Anyone she targets who can hear her voice when she speaks at a
 normal volume level must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or fall 
instantly under her influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> A living creature hit by a 
vampire lord's slam attack takes three negative levels, or six on a 
critical hit. For each negative level inflicted on an opponent, the 
vampire lord heals 5 points of damage (or 10 on a critical hit), gaining
 any excess as temporary hit points. After 24 hours have passed, the 
afflicted opponent must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 17) for each 
negative level. If successful, the negative level goes away with no harm
 to the creature; otherwise the creature's level is also reduced by one.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Alternate Form (Su): </b>A vampire lord can assume 
the form of any animal, as the druid ability wild shape used by a 
12th-level druid. The vampire lord can use this power at will as a 
move-equivalent action. The vampire lord can change from one animal 
shape to another without having to revert to its humanoid form.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Children of the Night (Su): </b>A vampire lord 
commands the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call 
forth a pack of 4d8 dire rats, a swarm of 10d10 bats, or a pack of 3d6 
wolves as a standard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and 
serve the vampire lord until released. Further, the vampire lord can 
sense through the senses of any such commanded creatures, and 
communicate empathically with them, to a range of 10 miles.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Control Weather</i> (Sp):</b> The vampire lord can cast either <i>control weather</i> or <i>fog cloud</i> (caster level 12th) at will.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> A humanoid or monstrous 
humanoid slain by a vampire lord's energy drain or blood drain attack 
rises as a vampire 1d4 days after burial. In either case, the new 
vampire is enslaved to the vampire lord until its master's death, and 
the willpower of the vampire lord is too strong to allow the new vampire
 to break free of its enslavement.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fast Healing (Ex): </b>The vampire lord heals 8 
points of damage each round so long as she has at least 1 hit point. If 
reduced to 0 hit points or below, she automatically assumes gaseous form
 and attempts to escape. A vampire lord must reach one of her designated
 places of rest within 24 hours or be utterly destroyed. (A vampire lord
 can have many places of rest prepared, since the only requirement is 
some soil from her homeland). She can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours. 
Once at rest in such a place, she rises to 1 hit point after 1 hour, 
then resumes healing at the rate of 8 hit points per round.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Gaseous Form (Su): </b>As a standard action, a 
vampire lord can assume gaseous form at will, as the spell (caster level
 5th), except that she can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly 
speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spider Climb (Ex): </b>A vampire lord can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Telekinesis (Su): </b>The vampire lord can use <i>telekinesis</i> (caster level 12th) at will.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Telepathy (Su): </b>The vampire lord can communicate
 telepathically with any living creature within 100 feet that has a 
language, and with any vampire under her direct control to a range of 1 
mile.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Turn Resistance (Ex): </b>The vampire lord is less 
easily affected by clerics or paladins than most undead. When resolving a
 turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, the vampire lord is treated 
as an 18-HD creature.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Undead Traits:</b> The vampire lord is immune to poison, <i>sleep,</i>
 paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, 
mind-influencing effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects. She is not subject to critical hits, 
subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative
 energy heals her, and she is not at risk of death from massive damage 
but is destroyed at 0 hit points or less. A vampire lord has darkvision 
(60-foot range). She cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if 
she is willing.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p class="size2">Robert Wiese grew up in a cave in the California desert
 called suburbia. He took refuge in groups for survival, such as the Boy
 Scouts and later a gaming club. He chose a mate and moved to the even 
wilder wilderness called Chicagoland, and there discovered the tribe of <a target="_blank" href="http://archive.wizards.com/leaving.asp?url=/rpga/main.asp?x=welcome,3&amp;origin=dnd_mm_20021018a">RPGA</a>.
 In 1995 he joined the leadership of this tribe, and slew the previous 
leader to take over as 1997 began. He ruled the tribe like a benevolent 
dictator for several years, but lost his mate and the fun of 
game-playing in the process. Eventually he rediscovered the fun of 
playing, and abdicated before he too was killed by an ambitious 
comer-upper. Now he lives in Reno, and keeps his fingers in the pie 
through convention planning and serving on the triad for his Living 
Greyhawk region. He devotes his time to his new mate and their pack of 
dependent creatures.</p>
