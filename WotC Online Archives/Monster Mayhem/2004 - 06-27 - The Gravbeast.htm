<p align="LEFT">The deeper the prospectors pushed into the rift, the 
higher the sheer canyon walls rose around them, and soon the group was 
trudging through deep shadow. Mylinna, a sharp-eyed halfling traveling 
at the rear of the group, looked skyward and fancied that she could see 
stars overhead, though Atuton, the group's wizard and scholar, had once 
assured her that such a thing wasn't possible in daylight.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Even though no danger was apparent, the halfling felt 
uneasy. Her comrades' footsteps echoed in the narrow canyon, making her 
feel as though the group was traipsing through some roofless dungeon. 
Her unease grew as the party moved along until she could feel the hair 
rise on the back of her neck. Thinking that she heard a sound from 
above, she halted and scanned the canyon walls once again. There it was!
 Some catlike beast, as big as a tiger, was running like a lizard along 
the stony wall. </p>
<p align="LEFT">With a hiss of warning to the others, Mylinna loosed a 
bullet from her sling. The missile seemed to fly true, but suddenly it 
veered away before it could strike home. At that very moment, Mylinna 
felt herself pulled violently upward. She managed to stop her ascent by 
grabbing onto a fissure in the rock wall, but every one of her 
companions shot upward almost as swiftly as Mylinna's bullet had. The 
halfling watched in horror as her friends' upward rise suddenly ended, 
leaving them bobbing defenselessly in the air. The strange beast bared 
its fangs and loped along the wall toward them, greed burning in its 
eyes. . . .</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>The creature walks on six thick but otherwise feline 
legs. A luxurious pelt with alternating stripes of blue-black and tawny 
gold covers its low, wide form. Its head and body look decidedly 
catlike.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Many scholars believe that the rare and bizarre 
gravbeast is related to the equally bizarre displacer beast. Whatever 
its origins, the gravbeast is a deadly carnivore with a short temper and
 an apparently insatiable appetite for fresh meat. It favors 
warm-blooded prey but may attack and eat nearly anything. To a 
gravbeast, any living creature is a potential meal, and it usually 
attacks anything it meets. Like displacer beasts, gravbeasts loathe 
blink dogs, and the two creatures attack each other ruthlessly when 
their paths cross. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A gravbeast looks like a massive, six-legged cat. Its 
10-foot-long body resembles that of a Bengal tiger, but the creature is 
built lower and heavier thanks to its very dense flesh. It weighs about 
800 pounds, and when it stands up on all six legs, the top of its head 
is only about 2 feet above the ground. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Gravbeasts speak Common.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Despite its bloodlust, a gravbeast is cunning enough to 
wait for a favorable moment to attack. When faced with particularly 
large or powerful prey, it often hangs back and tracks its victim for a 
while, waiting until its prey drops its guard to pounce. In battle, the 
gravbeast usually rears up on its hindmost legs so that it can claw with
 its other four feet while biting.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Knockdown (Su):</b> When a gravbeast pounces and hits
 with one or more claw attacks, the force of the blow might literally 
knock the opponent to the ground, thanks to the gravbeast's ability to 
increase its own mass (see Powerful Pounce, below). The gravbeast can 
attempt a knockdown as a free action without making a touch attack or 
provoking an attack of opportunity. The knockdown is resolved as though 
it were a trip attack made by a Huge creature (+8 size bonus; +13 bonus 
on trip attempts for the creature as presented here). If the attempt 
fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the gravbeast.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Powerful Pounce (Su):</b> A gravbeast can pounce on 
prey like a great cat. Unlike a mere animal, however, it can literally 
increase its mass when leaps on a foe. When a gravbeast charges, it 
makes six claw attacks and deals double damage on each hit. Thus, each 
claw deals 2d6+4 points of damage. The gravbeast cannot bite when using 
this ability.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If supernatural effects are suppressed in the locale 
where a gravbeast charges, the creature still can make a pounce attack 
as an extraordinary ability. In that case, it makes six claw attacks, 
each of which deals 1d6+2 points of damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Reverse Gravity (Su):</b> A gravbeast can literally reverse the gravity in an area of its choice. This ability works like the <i>reverse gravity</i>
 spell, except that the range is 60 feet, the duration is 6 rounds, and 
the area affected is a cylinder 20 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. 
The Reflex save DC (when applicable) is 17, and this save DC is 
Charisma-based. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A gravbeast usually uses this power to break up groups 
of foes, aiming the effect so that enemies it does not want to fight are
 in the area of reversed gravity, then attacking any foes left behind. 
Once the gravbeast activates this ability, it cannot use it again for 
2d4+2 rounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gravatic Stability (Su):</b> At will, a gravbeast can
 instantly alter its mass so that it weighs anywhere from its usual 800 
pounds to four times that amount. Using this ability does not require an
 action, and the gravbeast can alter its mass even when caught 
flat-footed or during another creature's turn. In any situation in which
 increased size would help the gravbeast (such as a bull rush, grapple, 
trip, or overrun), treat it as a Huge creature (+8 size bonus, already 
included in the grapple modifier given above). If this ability is 
suppressed, the gravbeast presented here has a grapple bonus of +15.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gravatic Turbulence (Su):</b> A gravbeast can 
surround itself with an aura of varying gravity that can foil ranged 
attacks by deflecting the projectile or thrown weapon. While this power 
is active, any ranged attack other than a ray has a 50% miss chance.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Once activated, this effect lasts for 6 rounds and 
cannot be activated again for 2d4+2 rounds. A gravbeast typically uses 
this power to protect itself from ranged attacks that foes caught in its
 reverse gravity power may launch against it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Personal Gravity (Su):</b> At will, a gravbeast can 
instantly reverse the direction of gravity's pull in relation to itself.
 Using this ability does not require an action, and the gravbeast can 
reverse its own gravity even when caught flat-footed or during another 
creature's turn. If this effect is suppressed, the gravbeast loses its 
climb speed and its racial bonus on Climb and Jump checks. While it is 
active, the gravbeast automatically succeeds on Climb checks, takes no 
damage from falls, and can use <i>levitate</i> (as the spell, caster level 6th) at will.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> A gravbeast receives a +8 racial bonus on
 Climb and Jump checks, thanks to its personal gravity ability. It also 
has a +4 racial bonus on Balance, Hide, Move Silently, and Survival 
checks. In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, its racial bonus on
 Hide checks increases to +8.</p>
