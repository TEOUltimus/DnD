<p class="size2">Was that a voice in the distance? </p>
<p class="size2">Ivalar glanced about, then winced as a fresh wave of 
pain coursed through his tortured body. The creature that had done this 
to him seemed to be gone again, but twice before, when he had tried to 
crawl back to the road, it had come at him with blinding speed. It had 
grabbed him each time about the neck and shoulders with its dripping 
talons and injected him with some horrible toxin. He could feel the 
stuff even now, coursing through his veins, scalding like boiling acid. 
The air he gasped itself seemed tainted by the stink of the poison, as 
did the sweat that slid into his eyes in burning streams.</p>
<p class="size2">Was it too late to hope? No, the sound returned . . . 
his companions had noticed his absence and were calling his name. From 
the sound of it, they were close. The beast had nabbed him from the back
 of the line with such stealth and speed that his allies hadn't even 
noticed the attack and only now returned to search for him. Ivalar knew 
that only a few minutes had lapsed since his capture, but those minutes 
had passed like hours. The poison in his system hadn't weakened him 
physically, but it clouded his mind with horrible hallucinations and 
visions, and each time the creature hauled him back into this gully it 
had fed on him with that terrible hooked proboscis. And each time it 
fed, his fear, his confusion, and even his hope seemed to cloud and 
drain away. Indeed, until he heard his companions calling his name, 
Ivalar had actually lost all interest in survival.</p>
<p class="size2">But now their voices were a beacon leading him back to 
life. Hope, frightening in its strangeness and alien feel, flared 
through his mind again as he staggered to his feet. Yes! There, about 
sixty feet up the road, shone their torches! Ivalar took two shuddering 
steps towards the light and gulped a lungful of air to cry for help.</p>
<p class="size2">Suddenly, the night around him slithered alive. The 
beast was there. All about him. It had been there all along, brooding 
over him and blending with the night, waiting for him to try to call for
 aid. </p>
<p class="size2">A tiny squeak escaped from Ivalar's mouth before the 
beast plunged its proboscis back into the familiar hole at the back of 
his neck. With one final gulp it drained from Ivalar the last of his 
hopes and fears. Ivalar crumbled to the ground, and as his eyes glazed 
over, he wondered what were the strange and beautiful shapes that 
carried fire as they passed by . . . not noticing him . . . not noticing
 the beast as it began to stalk a fresh victim. . . .</p>

<p class="size2">These terrifying monsters lurk in ambush, motionless 
and nearly invisible, lunging out with sudden terrible speed at their 
victims to feed on emotions with great relish.</p>
<p class="size2">A feverclaw measures about 14 feet in length and weighs
 nearly 1,400 pounds. The beast looks vaguely like a bald, six-legged 
tiger, with shiny black skin that resembles flexible obsidian. It has no
 neck to speak of. Two pairs of taloned arms rise out of the center of 
its shoulders just behind its trowel-shaped head. Six dead-black 
insectoid eyes form a "V" shape atop its head, and a long blood-red horn
 curves up from its snout. Its mouth, a writhing mess of tiny hooked 
grasping tendrils, lies on the underside of the head. When it attacks, a
 long, red, prehensile feeding proboscis tipped with a hollow bone 
lancet extends on a dripping fleshy stalk. The feverclaw radiates a 
cloying, stinking heat when in motion; the bitter stench of this heat is
 unmistakable to those who have been lucky enough to survive an attack 
by one of these creatures.</p>
<p class="size2">The feverclaw seems somewhat intelligent, but uses all 
of its intelligence to taunt and torment its prey. The creature feeds on
 the emotions of its victim. One may think that, given its method of 
attack, fear would be its favorite flavor. But hope is the sweetest 
nectar to the feverclaw: It delights in taunting and toying with its 
prey, repeatedly releasing it and then pouncing again just as the victim
 is about to reach safety, quickly siphoning out the hope through its 
feeding proboscis with noisy relish.</p>
<p class="size2">A feverclaw cannot speak; its only sound are terrible 
sucking and wheezing noises. Nevertheless, it understands Abyssal, 
Infernal, and Common to a limited extent, and can even communicate 
empathically with those from whom it currently feeds.<br></p>
<p class="size2"><b>COMBAT</b></p>
<p class="size2">The feverclaw has a particularly devastating and 
demoralizing method of attack. It lies in wait, perfectly motionless and
 nearly invisible, for prey to come within striking distance. When a 
target draws near, the feverclaw races out, using its Tumble skill, 
Spring Attack feat, and pounce ability to race up to its victim, snatch 
him up, and retreat to a hiding place all in one round. The feverclaw 
accomplishes this with a charge attack. If the initial claw attack hits,
 it may make its other attacks against the victim by using its pounce 
ability. Should it manage to grapple its victim, it then uses its Spring
 Attack and the remainder of its movement to seek a hiding spot. The 
feverclaw can make a Hide check at a -20 penalty to hide after such an 
attack even if it is being observed, as if it were sniping at its victim
 with a ranged weapon. Often, the allies of a feverclaw victim remain 
unaware of their companion's absence for several rounds. Some 
feverclaws, however, take pains to ensure that the snatching of prey is 
observed, spreading more fear and terror to flavor the taste of its next
 meals.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Charisma Drain (Su):</b> An individual struck by a 
feverclaw's proboscis must make a Fortitude save (DC 17) or permanently 
lose 1d4 points of Charisma (or twice that amount on a critical hit) as 
the monster drains away the victim's emotions. The feverclaw heals 5 
points of damage (10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains Charisma, 
gaining any excess as temporary hit points.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> If a feverclaw hits an 
opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a 
claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a
 free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus 
+23). If it gets a hold, it automatically hits with its proboscis 
attack. Thereafter, the feverclaw has the option to conduct the grapple 
normally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on 
grapple check, but the feverclaw is not considered grappled). In either 
case, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds 
automatically deals claw damage.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> A feverclaw delivers its poison 
(Fortitude save DC 21) with each successful claw attack. The initial 
damage is 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as the creature's poison rapidly 
burns into the victim's brain and mind. Those poisoned by a feverclaw 
quickly become quite hot to the touch and sweat profusely; one round 
after the initial damage, the victim must save again or suffer 1d6 
points of permanent Constitution damage as the intense heat takes its 
toll.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Pounce (Ex):</b> If a feverclaw charges, it can make a full attack even though it has moved.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Alacrity (Su)</b>: The feverclaw can move with 
distressing speed and grace. It may make an additional partial action 
each round, and as long as it is not flat-footed it gains a +4 bonus to 
its Armor Class.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Blur (Su)</b>: A feverclaw is constantly under the influence of a <i>blur</i> effect, and as a result gains the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Freeze in Place (Su)</b>: If a feverclaw remains 
motionless for a full round, it blends into its surroundings and gains a
 +10 circumstance bonus on all Hide checks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities (Ex)</b>: The feverclaw is immune to mind-affecting effects, fire, poison, paralysis, <i>slow</i>, <i>sleep</i>, and magical temporal effects (such as <i>time stop</i> or the aging caused by a ghost).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Outsider Traits: </b>A feverclaw has darkvision (60-foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected, though a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell can restore life.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills (Ex)</b>: A feverclaw gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.</p>
