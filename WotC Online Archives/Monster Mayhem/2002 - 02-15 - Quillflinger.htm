<p class="size2"><i>Magnus took a step forward and heard a telltale 
click beneath his foot. He winced, waiting to be struck by whatever he 
had triggered. Instead, the sound of turning cranks and clinking chains 
filled the corridor from somewhere behind the walls, and a loud crash of
 metal on stone sounded somewhere around the corner. "Oh, wonderful." 
said Ien, who stood several feet behind Magnus.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Ambling around the corner about 40 feet ahead came a
 large beast bristling with long, menacing quills. The thing reared its 
head from beneath its quills and let out a loud snarl, staring down the 
group of them.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>"What is that thing?" Magnus asked, not really expecting an answer.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>"I dunno," Nesker replied, "but it doesn't look happy."</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Lia nocked an arrow and knelt, trying to get a bead 
on the creature between the hulking forms of Magnus and Nesker. Ien 
began backing away slightly, magic crackling between his fingers. Magnus
 turned his head to say something to Lia, but instead she heard a 
sickening </i>thok thok<i> sound. Magnus grunted and dropped to one 
knee, impaled through the shoulder and twice in the right thigh by three
 of the creature's long quills.</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Ien looked up to see the creature still standing a 
good 40 feet away at the corner of the corridor. It snarled and reared 
again, as though it was readying another volley. . . .</i></p>
<p class="size2">At first glance, a quillflinger may be mistaken for a 
common, if enormous, porcupine. Most quillflingers can grow to be over 6
 feet across from quill-tip to quill-tip and the tip of its tallest 
quill can reach heights of up to 5 1/2 feet. </p>
<p class="size2">A quillflinger's quills range in length from 11 inches 
to 3 feet, depending on their location on the quillflinger's body (and 
the size of the quillflinger). Because of the sheer density of the 
quills, many blows never actually hit the quillflinger's body, instead 
getting caught up in the quills, and ranged attacks tend to miss the 
actual body of the quillflinger entirely.</p>
<p class="size2">There have been reports in the past of quillflingers in
 the deep forest reaching over 8 feet tall, with quills measuring well 
over 4 feet in length. Reports of this sort are hardly ever confirmed, 
however, because rarely does one see a quillflinger of that size and 
return to tell the tale.</p>
<p class="size2">A quillflinger's legs are rather short and close to its
 body, making it a fairly slow (but surprisingly nimble) animal. Their 
feet are tipped with small, sharp claws, which function well for 
climbing but are ineffective in combat due to the length of their legs. 
They tend to shuffle along, and they rarely run as fast as most other 
animals. Its quills make it a formidable enemy, however, even to much 
faster and larger creatures. As such, the quillflinger has very few 
natural predators.</p>
<p class="size2">The face of a quillflinger resembles that of a 
flat-faced wild dog, but its ears are set close in on the sides of its 
head, beneath its front row of quills. They possess a row of sharp 
canine teeth and jaws that are strong enough to rend the flesh of most 
animals. Their favorite prey is small deer and elk, wild dogs, and wild 
reptiles.</p>
<p class="size2">Quillflingers generally reside in temperate evergreen 
forests, staking out territory and hunting for food. They are solitary 
creatures (with the exception of those that have mates), frequently 
fighting each other for a piece of forest they've staked out. 
Quillflingers mate for life, so they are sometimes seen in pairs with 
their mate, hunting their native forests or roaming the hillsides where 
they live.</p>
<p class="size2">Quillflingers hunt by lying close to the ground and 
camouflaging themselves in the surrounding undergrowth or in tall grass.
 When prey comes within range, they fling their quills with deadly 
accuracy up to 120 feet away, then drag any resulting carcasses close to
 the center of their marked territory to feast.</p>
<p class="size2">It is extremely rare to find a quillflinger outside its
 natural habitat, and it's even rarer to find one in captivity. Many who
 try to actively hunt or capture one do not live through the encounter, 
and even those who succeed are usually scarred for the effort. 
Occasionally, some use quillflingers as guard animals for dungeons or 
vaults, but only the most unhinged person would take the risk of 
attempting to capture one to use as a guard dog.</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">Quillflingers rely on their quills in combat. They 
rarely move except to back away from their opponents, and they spend 
most of their time firing their quills from a safe distance. Most 
quillflingers attack only if provoked or cornered. However, they are 
fiercely territorial, and they viciously defend their own territory. A 
quillflinger rarely uses its bite attack, and it usually does so only if
 its opponent gets too close, is somehow immune to its quills, or is at 
least 1 size category smaller than the quillflinger itself. </p>
<p class="size2">A quillflinger can fire all of its quills at an 
opponent. A quillflinger can also fire quills in any direction 
(including straight up) regardless of the direction it's facing. When in
 its natural habitat in the forest, a quillflinger sometimes climbs the 
trunk of a large tree and fires its quills from a safe distance above 
its attackers.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Quills (Ex): </b>Melee combat with a quillflinger is
 dangerous. Unless opponents are using weapons with at least 10-foot 
reach, the quillflinger strikes each melee opponent with 1d4 quills. If 
the opponent succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 16), the quills that strike 
do not break off in his or her flesh. A quill that lodges in the skin 
imposes a -1 circumstance penalty to attacks, saves, and checks. 
Removing a quill inflicts 1d6 points of additional damage to the victim.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fling Quills (Ex)</b>: A quillflinger can send forth
 a volley of 3 quills as a standard action. This attack has a range of 
120 feet with no range increment. These quills are treated as thrown 
weapons. Sometimes a quillflinger uses this attack while hunkered down 
(see below). In such cases, the quillflinger makes a Listen check 
(opposed by the foe's Move Silently check) to garner a general bearing 
on where its opponent stands, and thus does not gain its Dexterity bonus
 to the ranged attack. If the quillflinger cannot hear an opponent, it 
does not fire any quills.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Quill Flurry (Ex)</b>: If a quillflinger becomes 
cornered or severely outnumbered, it turns its back on its opponent(s) 
and fire a hail of quills, which fills a cone directly behind the 
quillflinger. Anyone caught in the flurry is immediately struck by 2d4 
quills, dealing 1d6 damage each. A successful Reflex save (DC 13) halves
 the damage. The quillflinger can use this attack only once per day, as 
it takes time for the quills to grow back. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hunker Down (Ex)</b>: If the quillflinger is 
threatened in melee, and if it cannot retreat to a safe distance from 
its opponent(s), it curls its head and legs under its torso while on the
 ground and flares its quills in all directions. In this defensive 
position, the Reflex save DC required for melee attacks against it 
increases to 17. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Low-Light Vision: </b>A quillflinger can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar low-light conditions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scent (Ex): </b>A quillflinger can detect 
approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell 
(30-foot range in normal conditions). </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills:</b> *Quillflingers get a +8 racial bonus to 
Hide checks when hiding in forest undergrowth or the tall grass common 
to their natural habitat. The coloring and arrangement of their quills 
tends to make them look like a shrub or plant to the average observer.</p>
