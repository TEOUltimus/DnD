<p align="LEFT">"What was that?" whispered the elf cleric Zezbrin under 
his breath, sweeping the surrounding trees with his practiced gaze. A 
couple of low-voiced commands to his twin longswords caused one to erupt
 in flame and the other to crackle with lightning. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The diminutive barbarian Uma dropped into a crouch as 
she reached over her shoulder to pull her greataxe free from its sling. 
At the same time, Twitty, the gnome, reached for his spell component 
pouch. "I'm not sure," he whispered to Zezbrin, "but I don't see it 
now." The three had pursued their captured companions deep into the 
great swamp, deeper than they had ever been before. Since the only reply
 to their fervent whispers was the buzzing of insects, the trio crept 
forward, alert for danger.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Eventually, they relaxed enough to continue their trek 
along the narrow path, their feet growing wet and weary from walking. 
Just as they were about ready to call for a rest, the trees around them 
exploded with motion and color, and small, froglike creatures began to 
fire arrows at them from all directions. The stalwart adventurers moved 
quickly into defensive positions and began to cast protective spells, 
but it was too late. The reptilian hunters' arrows found their marks too
 soon, and the heroes' legs began to grow heavy and weak as the 
venom-tipped projectiles did their job. When the attack was over, 
Zezbrin, Uma, and Twitty lay face down in the marsh, unable to move. The
 brush near them parted, and the largest of the reptilian hunters 
approached the fallen group. "Who are you, and why do you trespass in 
o'bati hunting grounds?" it asked in a croaking voice. "Speak quickly, 
elf," it said, flipping Zezbrin over, "or you and your friends will be 
spitted and roasted before the light leaves the swamp this day."</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>This short humanoid resembles a 3-foot-tall, 
marsh-green tree frog with bright red skin covering the top of its head 
and back. It walks upright and carries a long spear, and a stout-looking
 bow hangs loosely from one hand. A quiver full of arrows is strapped to
 the creature's hip. </i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The carnivorous o'bati are deadly predators that hunt in
 small bands. They dwell in small communities known as clusters, which 
consist of low, mud-and-thatch dwellings that serve as entrances to 
larger burrows. The o'bati are dedicated archers, and indeed their 
culture is based on mastery of the bow -- both its use and its 
construction. The o'bati frequently trade with elves, who tend to share 
their appreciation for their chosen weapon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A typical o'bati stands 3 to 4 feet tall and weighs 
between 30 and 50 pounds. Its face, underside, and limbs can be any 
shade from olive to jade green, but the skin on its back ranges from 
bright red to violet. </p>
<p align="LEFT">O'bati speak Draconic.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Whenever possible, o'bati coordinate their attacks, 
surrounding their opponents and peppering them with arrows tipped with 
poison harvested from their own skins. They prefer to move in, launch a 
couple of volleys of arrows, then fade back into the surrounding trees 
to allow their poison time to work. O'bati are extremely patient, and 
they are quite capable of employing such hit-and-run tactics for hours 
until their enemies are exhausted.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> The brightly colored skin on an 
o'bati's back exudes a venom (contact and injury, Fortitude DC 10, 
initial and secondary damage 1d6 Dexterity) similar to that of certain 
poisonous tree frogs but considerably less deadly. As a standard action,
 an o'bati hunter may scrape an arrow across his back to envenom it and 
then fire it at an opponent. An o'bati archer with the Manyshot feat can
 envenom multiple arrows simultaneously and fire them all at once. Any 
creature that strikes an o'bati using natural weapons or unarmed strikes
 is also subject to the poison. Merely wearing gloves does not protect 
an attacker foolish enough to strike the o'bati in this manner. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Furthermore, the effectiveness of the o'bati's poison 
increases with its concentration in the body of the target. Every time a
 creature comes into contact with the venom (either via arrows or its 
own natural or through unarmed attacks) over the course of a 24-hour 
period, the save DC increases by +1 (max DC 10 + o'bati's racial HD + 
4). The save DCs are Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> The o'bati's strong legs grant it a +4 
racial bonus on Jump and Swim checks. Furthermore, it receives a +8 
racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb 
checks, even if rushed or threatened.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>O'bati Society</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">These intelligent carnivores live in relative harmony 
with their surroundings. As a people, they work hard to ensure the 
ecological health of their habitat and help the animal populations 
around them thrive. They believe that the path to true enlightenment is 
through the mastery of the bow and the hunt, so they neither grow crops 
nor domesticate animals.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The o'bati refer to their humble villages as clusters, 
and several clusters in the same area constitute a tribe. Each cluster 
has a huntmaster -- typically a druid or ranger of some power -- who 
reports to the tribal chieftain. The chieftains have no established 
places of residence in any particular clusters; they simply roam the 
lands controlled by their tribes, serving as protectors and guides where
 needed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>O'bati as Characters</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">O'bati characters possess the following racial traits.</p>
<ul>
<li> +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength.</li>
<li> Small size. +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 
bonus on Hide checks, -4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and carrying
 limits 3/4 those of Medium characters.</li>
<li> An o'bati's base land speed is 30 feet, and it has a climb speed of 20 feet.</li>
<li> Weapon Proficiency: An o'bati is automatically proficient with the longspear and longbow.</li>
<li> +1 natural armor bonus.</li>
<li> Bite: An o'bati has a natural bite attack that deals 1d4 points of 
damage. The damage bonus is 1-1/2 times its Str bonus (if any) or its 
full Str penalty (if any).</li>
<li> Poison (see above for details).</li>
<li> Low-light vision.</li>
<li> Automatic Languages: Draconic, Elven. Bonus Languages: Aquan, Common, Goblin, Orc.</li>
<li> Favored Class: Ranger.</li>
<li> Level Adjustment +2.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">The o'bati warrior presented here had the following 
ability scores before racial adjustments: Strength 13, Dexterity 11, 
Constitution 12, Intelligence 10, Wisdom 9, Charisma 8.</p>
