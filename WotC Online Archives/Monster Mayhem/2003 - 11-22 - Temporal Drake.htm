<p align="LEFT">Studying the temporal drake has proven difficult. Not 
only are the creatures dangerous in the extreme, but the source of their
 many potent abilities is not readily apparent, even to the trained 
observer. Sages believe their erratic movement and elusive nature stems 
from some innate ability to manipulate time -- hence, their name. 
Speculation aside, a few things are known: They move far faster than 
mere muscle and bone would allow, their uncanny ability to avoid weapon 
blows and spells cannot be countered by magic that pierces illusion, and
 they can temporarily force creatures into a sort of suspended state 
where time does not pass.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In summation, although they are an interesting oddity to
 be sure, temporal drakes are both too dangerous to be studied without 
great expense and too few to threaten any established community. They 
remain a problem only for those foolish individuals who insist upon 
traipsing through the forgotten corners of the world and the outmost 
reaches of the wilderness.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>Long and low to the ground, the draconic creature has
 the bulk and strength of a true dragon but a feline grace all its own. 
It seems to wink erratically in and out of sight, and its gray scales 
cast back light in incongruous patterns, reflecting glints of light at 
odd times and angles.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like the wyvern, the temporal drake is a distant cousin 
of the true dragons. Smaller than all but the youngest true dragons, the
 temporal drake has neither the intellect nor the innate magical ability
 of its powerful kindred. The temporal drake's strengths, and the source
 of its name, lie in its ability to manipulate the passage of time. 
Although not capable of significant time travel, the drake moves through
 and manipulates time in ways that other creatures have difficulty 
understanding. By stepping outside of time for a split second, the drake
 can appear to move across the battlefield instantaneously, cause 
apparently accurate blows to miss, and even seemingly return from the 
dead.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Temporal drakes are dangerous hunters that stalk and 
kill animals and other creatures for food. Confident in their own might,
 temporal drakes do not hesitate to attack even numerous or well-armed 
groups, but they are not so foolish as to remain in a fight when 
overmatched. If caught and trained at a young age, temporal drakes can 
serve ably as mounts.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A typical temporal drake stands about 5 feet tall at the
 shoulder and has a wingspan of up to 18 feet. Temporal drakes weigh 
about 1,250 pounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Temporal drakes speak Draconic.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A dangerous hunter and melee combatant, the temporal 
drake trusts to its physical prowess and supernatural abilities and 
wades fearlessly into combat. Although less intelligent than the average
 human, the drake can invent sophisticated ambushes. The drake usually 
begins fights by using its temporal slide ability to appear in the midst
 of its foes, then makes a full attack, preferably against anyone that 
looks like a spellcaster. The drake is also smart enough to keep one use
 of its temporal slide ability in reserve in case it has to flee.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Temporal Slide (Su): </b>The temporal drake can 
manipulate time as it moves, allowing it to seemingly disappear and 
reappear elsewhere instantaneously. As a free action that does not 
provoke an attack of opportunity, the temporal drake moves its current 
speed (following the normal rules for movement). The temporal drake can 
use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Constitution 
bonus (4 for an average temporal drake). It can use this ability only 
once per round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Temporal Inversion (Su): </b>Once per day, as a 
standard action, a temporal drake can shunt one creature out of the time
 stream for a short period. The temporal drake can affect any creature 
within 60 feet. The creature is then shunted out of time unless it 
succeeds on a DC 18 Will saving throw. Time passes for creatures other 
than the affected creature, and it can take no actions other than trying
 to escape. The creature seems to vanish, while out of the time stream 
no other creature, spell, magical effect, or force can affect it in any 
way. (It is as though the creature has ceased to exist.) Each round on 
its turn, the affected creature may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check 
to rejoin the time stream as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't
 escape, the effect ends after 10 minutes. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Progressive Initiative (Ex): </b>The temporal drake 
moves through time differently than other creatures, so its initiative 
value changes as combat progresses. Each round after the first round of 
combat, the temporal drake's initiative score becomes 4 higher. This 
will often cause the temporal drake to act at a different time in the 
initiative order in many rounds. This ability is automatic, and requires
 no action by the temporal drake.</p>
<p align="LEFT">When the temporal drake uses the delay or ready actions,
 its initiative value changes as normal; however, its initiative score 
becomes 4 higher each round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Time Slip (Su): </b>The temporal drake can step back 
in time a fraction of a second, potentially changing the outcome of one 
action. The temporal drake can immediately reroll a d20 roll that it 
just made, but before the outcome of the die roll is determined. The 
temporal drake takes the better of the two rolls. Using this ability is a
 free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The 
temporal drake can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 
its Constitution bonus (4 for an average temporal drake). The temporal 
drake may use this ability only once in any given round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Recurrence (Ex): </b>As a temporal drake dies, it 
calls a different version of itself out of the time stream. This means 
that one round after the temporal drake's death, it reappears fresh and 
ready for combat. This new drake possesses full hit points, fully 
restored daily uses of its abilities, and no effects of the recent 
fight. The drake takes one full round's worth of actions and then 
disappears, returning to its original place in the time stream. (It does
 reappear thereafter.) If this drake is killed before it disappears, it 
simply dies, and another drake does not appear.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Temporal Displacement (Su):</b> The temporal drake 
blinks in and out of the time stream quickly and at random. This causes 
attacks against the temporal drake to have a 20% miss chance, and 
neither the Blind-Fight feat or spells such as <i>true seeing </i>or <i>see invisibility</i> help against this miss chance. Like other supernatural abilities, this ability is suppressed in an <i>anti-magic</i> field.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Training a Temporal Drake</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Long sought by both spellcasters and warriors as mounts,
 temporal drakes support their riders with powerful supernatural 
abilities, excellent movement capabilities, and formidable melee 
attacks. Although intelligent, a temporal drake requires training before
 it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a temporal drake must 
have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved 
through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly temporal 
drake takes six weeks of work and a DC 35 Handle Animal check. Riding a 
temporal drake requires an exotic saddle. A temporal drake can fight 
while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot attack unless he or she 
succeeds on a Ride check.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Temporal drake eggs are worth 15,000 gp apiece on the 
open market, while hatchlings are worth 35,000 gp and up. The few 
professional trainers skilled enough to train a temporal drake charge 
5,000 gp and up to complete the task.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Note:</i> Creatures of the dragon type are not 
normally trainable with the Handle Animal skill, but because of their 
intelligence and temperament, temporal drakes can be trained using the 
same rules for training magical beasts.</p>
