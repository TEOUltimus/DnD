 found the villager, freshly dead, his body cut countless times. He was 
too late -- again. Standing with disgust, he was about to scream his 
frustration when he glimpsed a shadow move. Spinning, he laughed out 
loud. He was not too late on this day.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>He prepared a spell as the beast rushed him. The 
six-legged dog came snarling out of the darkness and slashed Yurei's 
thigh, disrupting the spell. </i>Stupid, <i>Yurei chided himself. He readied the next spell while trying to block the pain of his bleeding thigh. He blasted the</i> fireball<i>
 towards the hound, but it shifted nimbly to the side and avoided the 
flames. It then rushed again and sliced Yurei's other thigh.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>"So, the pursuer has finally caught his prey." A 
cloaked figure emerged from the darkness, revealing a broad smile as he 
stared at Yurei writhing on the ground. "Congratulations to you Yurei, 
for you have found death tonight. I wonder if one so adept at the dark 
arts can withstand the pain that my pet shall unleash upon you. Do you 
wish to flee? Come Yurei, I can taste your fear." </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>The figure flicked out a hand, causing waves of pain 
in Yurei that forced him to cry out. The humanoid laughed aloud and 
motioned the dog to attack. The hound bounded forward to maul Yurei.</i></p>
<p align="left"><i>In an act of desperation, Yurei managed to pull forth
 his siangham and call the Oni from within. "Save me!" he cried. Then he
 succumbed to the pain and passed out.</i></p>
<p align="left">Those with the understanding of the elements know the <i>utzou, </i>or
 Void, is not merely empty space, but a powerful medium that binds the 
elements together. Certain enlightened individuals actually learn to tap
 this force and use it for their own means. The void disciples (from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882440000">Oriental Adventures</a></i>) also know of the danger that lurks there -- the creatures that call the Void home.</p>
<p align="left">Void walkers are rarely seen by those who are not 
targets, for they are elusive and enigmatic in their ways. Those people 
lucky enough to see one without being a target never seem to get a good 
look. It's always just a shadow in the corner of the eye, a glimpse 
blinded by the sun.</p>
<p align="left">It is unclear why or how these creatures pick a target, 
but when a choice is made, they leave four similar objects where the 
target will be the first to find them. Objects used have ranged from 
copper coins to fresh-cut flowers, but in each case, the four items are 
laid in a perfect row. Many of their victims do not realize the 
significance of this warning, but almost all that receive this offering 
are found dead -- sliced horribly --within a week. </p>
<p align="left">Some who have studied the significance of the objects 
believe that they represent the four basic elements (fire, water, earth,
 and air). Many of their targets have been void disciples or those who 
have sought knowledge of the Void. For these reasons it is believed the 
creatures are guardians of the void and seek to safeguard its secrets. 
However, the fear that their warning instills and the brutality of the 
deaths often lead scholars to the conclusion that the creatures somehow 
feed on the fear of their victims and that they enjoy stalking and 
killing their prey.</p>

<p align="left"><i>The slender humanoid stands about six feet tall. It 
has gray skin, black eyes, and no hair on its head. Dressed in a simple 
cloak, it stares with burning hatred.</i></p>
<p align="left">Void walkers are humanoid-shaped denizens of the Void. 
They typically dress in nondescript peasant clothes and cloaks in drab 
colors such as dull brown or muted green. The walkers speak little, but 
they engage their target in a largely one-sided conversation. They 
question the target's integrity, honor, and being, all with the intent 
to rattle the victim into making a stupid mistake.</p>
<p align="left">Void walkers usually avoid combat, allowing their hounds
 to dispatch their target. If forced to fight, they wield their katanas 
with deadly precision. They generally have several levels in a character
 class, favoring those with spellcasting ability.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">In addition to their katanas (see pages 144-145 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>) and class ability (if any), void walkers use the following special abilities.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>At will -- <i>pain </i>(DC 18)<i>, tongues, teleport without error. </i>Caster level 14th.<i></i>The save DCs are Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left">The pain ability works by touch. A living creature 
touched must make a Fortitude save or be wracked by searing pain for 1 
minute. While the pain lasts, the victim takes a -4 penalty on attack 
rolls, skill checks, and ability checks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Void Subtype: </b>Void creatures are made of the same
 empty space that comprises the Void. Normal creatures (that is, 
creatures without the void subtype) cannot see them unless the void 
creature makes its presence known, either by an act of will (a free 
action) or by attacking. A void creature has total concealment (50% miss
 chance) unless it reveals itself. <i>See invisibility </i>and <i>invisibility purge </i>don't reveal void creatures, but <i>true seeing</i>
 does. Blindsight and blindsense don't reveal void creatures. Members of
 the void disciple class can see void creatures. Once it reveals itself,
 a void creature remains visible until it uses a free action to conceal 
itself again.</p>
<p align="left">A void hound can avoid magical and unusual attacks with 
great agility; it has the evasion special ability. If the creature makes
 a successful Reflex save against an attack that normally deals half 
damage on a successful save, the void creature instead takes no damage. A
 helpless void creature does not gain the benefit of evasion. A void 
creature must be wearing light or no armor to benefit from evasion.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Immunity to Energy Drain (Ex): </b>Due to their 
physical makeup, energy drains of any type (level drain, temporary or 
permanent ability damage, etc.) cannot affect void walkers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Outsider Traits: </b>A void walker cannot be raised, 
reincarnated or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or 
true resurrection spell can restore life). Darkvision 60 ft.</p>

<p align="left"><i>The gray, six-legged canine snarls through its large 
muzzle. The hairless monster has rows of razorlike bone protruding along
 its spine.</i></p>
<p align="left">Void walkers created the void hounds as companions and 
killing machines. They are six-legged hairless dogs with whiplike tails.
 Coloration ranges from dull gray to black, and most have black or red 
eyes. They possess viscous fangs and their front pair of legs has claws 
similar to those of a bear. Their most dangerous feature, however, is 
their backbone: Each vertebra has a razorlike protrusions jutting out 
through the hide. These sharp bones are strong as steel and cause 
devastating wounds as the hound rushes by. As the hounds grow older, 
they increase in size.</p>
<p align="left">Void hounds are completely loyal and obedient to their 
masters. They will kill quickly or toy with a target, depending on the 
cruelty of the walker commanding them.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">As beings of the Void, the hounds share many of the same special traits as their masters.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Immunity to Energy Drain (Ex): </b>Due to their 
physical makeup, energy drains of any type (level drain, temporary or 
permanent ability damage, etc.) cannot effect void hounds.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Slice Charge (Ex): </b>A seeker can use its 
razor-sharp spine as a weapon; to do so, it must charge. The seeker 
throws its whole body into attack and gains 1-1/2 times its Strength 
bonus on damage, just as if using a sole natural weapon.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wounding (Ex): </b>A hit from the seeker's slice 
charge deals 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits
 a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the Constitution damage. 
Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are 
immune to the Constitution damage dealt by the slice charge.</p>

<p align="left">Stalkers are simply Huge seeker hounds. They have the following change to their combat profile:</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wounding (Ex): </b>A hit from the slayer's slice 
charge deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage from blood loss when it 
hits a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the Constitution 
damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and 
constructs) are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by the slice 
charge.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills: </b>A void hound has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks.</p>
