<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miala
 paced back and forth on the beach, waiting impatiently. Impatience was 
new to the druid, and not pleasant. She had come at the request of a 
group of fishermen who had been attacked by a strange creature. Three of
 their number were dead, and six others awaited healing of serious 
injuries in the nearby temple of Pelor. The creature, they said, was 
like a centaur, but more horrible than anything they could imagine. It 
had come from the sea to attack them on the beach while they cleaned 
their nets.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 was the first group to survive an attack by whatever it was. Nine 
fishermen had been found dead on or near the beach in the last month. 
Apparently whatever it was had arrived about that time. </span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miala
 was here because one of the fishermen thought the creature might be a 
fey of some kind, and Miala was reputed to know much about such beings. 
She had never heard of anything like this, but she liked to learn about 
new creatures.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"I
 don't see any tracks along the whole beach," shouted her friend Scout, a
 ranger and cleric of Ehlonna. "The creature hasn't been here since at 
least the last high tide, and probably not for three days or more." That
 timing corresponded to the attack on the fishermen, and since no other 
humans had been on the beach since the attack, Miala believed that the 
creature struck simply to hurt humans. Or humanoids. It was impossible 
to tell at this time if it had a grudge against humans or simply killed 
creatures that got too close to the water.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Night's about to fall, Scout. We'd better head back to the village. Tomorrow we can go for a swim."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"You
 can go for a swim tomorrow, Miss 
I-can-turn-into-a-fish-whenever-I-want," Scout replied. "But I agree 
about heading back now. Maybe we can get some divinations and learn 
more--"</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Scout's
 words were cut off as the sounds of pounding hooves and splashing water
 met their ears. They turned to see a hideous centaurlike creature with 
pointed ears, a head way too big for its body, and strange fin-like 
growths at its feet. What made Miala turn and put a hand on her mouth to
 keep her lunch down was seeing that it had no skin at all. She could 
see black lines where veins ran across the creature, and its muscles. It
 looked as if something had skinned it alive and turned it loose.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Scout
 drew her swords and stepped forward to meet the charge, but was flung 
back and to the left as the creature impacted her body. Miala dived out 
of the way as it tried to take a swipe at her, too. Scout moved behind 
the creature as it stopped and turned toward the druid; she hit hard 
with her two swords. The creature shrieked and kicked out at her, but 
did not connect. Scout moved in to take a swipe, then moved away before 
it could return the favor, as it seemed able to attack with its long 
arms, its hooves, and its huge mouth. Miala stepped back to cast a <i>flame strike</i>
 on the creature, which opened up its blood vessels and caused it to 
look even more hideous. The creature charged Miala and knocked the druid
 down, injuring her severely and tearing away a piece of flesh from her 
arm with its teeth.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Scout's
 attacks were not having as much effect as they should, and the creature
 was getting in licks of its own. Miala stepped back and cast another 
damaging spell, this time a <i>waterball</i>. As the fresh water 
exploded around the creature, it hissed in fright and turned toward the 
sea. It galloped away at a full run and plunged into the waves, leaving 
the two women shaking and breathing hard.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"That was probably what we were looking for," Scout said. "I wonder why your spell drove it off."</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Miala finished a <i>cure light wounds</i>
 spell that closed up the bite wound somewhat. "We'd really better get 
back to the village now," she said. "Divinations are definitely in 
order. And maybe some help. I wonder if Iron and Rannell are somewhere 
close by . . ."</span></p>

<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 bizarre creature appears as a large horse with a human torso and head, 
and flippers at the end of its legs. Its head is far too large for its 
body. It seems to have no skin at all, and it reeks of rotten fish.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A
 nuchlavis is a horrible-looking fey creature of unparalleled evil that 
preys on humanoids near the coast. It also preys on other fey, and 
whatever else it can physically dominate. A nuchlavis is a sea-dwelling 
faerie creature that can come onto the land for brief periods to bring 
terror.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Similar
 to a centaur in appearance, a nuchlavis possesses a horse's body and a 
human-like torso and head. Its head, however, is more than four times as
 large as it should be, and sometimes lolls to the side, as if the neck 
cannot support the weight. It has a single red eye in its face, from 
which it looks hatefully upon the world. Its mouth is almost too wide 
for its face, and vaguely porcine. Within this mouth the creature has 
long, sharp teeth that easily tear flesh. Long, powerful arms hang 
simianlike down its body. The creature has fins or flippers on its feet,
 yet somehow can run on land. Some theorize that the leg ends in a hoof 
and a flipper, and that the creature can move the flipper aside for 
running on land.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 nuchlavis's lack of skin constitutes the most horrible aspect of its 
appearance. Its white sinews and red muscles are visible when it moves, 
and one can see its black blood flowing through its yellowish veins if 
one gets close enough to look. A nuchlavis smells horrible as well, the 
scent a mix of rotting eggs and spoiled, mildewed fish.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A nuchlavis speaks Common and Sylvan.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b>COMBAT</b></span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Brutal combatants, nuchlavises prefer direct attacks. They fight with fists, hooves, and their terrible bite.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b>
 A nuchlavis that hits with a slam attack may start a grapple as a free 
action without provoking an attack of opportunity. A nuchlavis that has 
successfully grappled a foe automatically bites on the same round.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Stench (Ex):</b>
 A nuchlavis has a horrible odor that can be detected up to 100 feet 
away. All living creatures (except nuchlavises) within 30 ft. must make a
 Fort save (DC 18) or be sickened for as long as they remain in range 
and for one round thereafter. The save DC is Constitution-based. A 
successful save grants immunity to the stench for 24 hours. If a 
creature that has failed a save against the stench escapes from the 
stench's area, but later enters it again, it must save again. The stench
 is not a poison, so resistances and spells that affect poison do not 
negate the effects of the stench.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Amphibious (Ex):</b>
 A nuchlavis can breathe both air and water, though it usually does not 
remain outside its aquatic home longer than necessary to attack its 
prey.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Fear of Fresh Water (Ex):</b>
 A nuchlavis is deathly afraid of fresh water, even though fresh water 
has no ability to harm the creature. A nuchlavis will hide under the sea
 whenever it rains, and will not cross fresh-water rivers, lakes, or 
even streams. If splashed with at least a gallon of fresh water, a 
nuchlavis must makes a Will save (DC 15) or become panicked until it can
 hid beneath the sea, and for 1 minute thereafter. If struck by a 
water-producing spell, the DC for the panic effect is the same as the DC
 for the spell.</span></p>
