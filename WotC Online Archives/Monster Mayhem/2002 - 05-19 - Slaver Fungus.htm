<p class="size2"><i>Taken from the recovered journal of Istall Twigbrin, scholar and wiseman of the village of Dinbrim:</i></p>
<p class="size2"><b>5th Day of the Harvest Moon</b></p>
<p class="size2">After gathering rock berries and tungit root in the 
pine forest near my home, I was surprised to find several local farmers 
waiting for my return. They were clearly agitated and heavily armed with
 a variety of weapons and farming tools. A tightly bound figure lay at 
their feet, wrapped head to toe in rough rope and struggling mightily. 
The farmers said that he was a family member who had become "possessed" 
while hunting in the woods. The peasants, who often come to me with 
questions regarding plants and the woods in which they live, believed I 
might be able to explain what had happened to their kinsman. I agreed to
 examine him and do what I could. They brought the struggling figure 
into my cabin.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>6th Day of the Harvest Moon</b></p>
<p class="size2">My hands tremble as I write this. I have been studying 
Rael, the peasant boy, all night now and can barely believe what I 
observe. The boy is completely covered in a layer of fungus -- a type 
that I have never seen before. It has completely consumed his eyes and 
oozes out of his ears, mouth, and nose. Despite this, Rael remains alive
 in some way. I have done some research and discovered that a similar 
incident occurred in this area more than a hundred years ago, but the 
cause was never determined. Curious. We have continued to keep the boy 
(if he can be called that anymore) bound in his ropes, as he will lash 
out and bite at any opportunity. If he recognizes his family, he shows 
no sign. Believing the boy to be possessed by foul spirits, I asked one 
of the peasants to fetch a priest from the Shandarin Temple in the next 
town. Perhaps faith can give answers where I have failed.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>9th Day of the Harvest Moon</b></p>
<p class="size2">The peasants and I are barricaded inside my barn, under
 siege by fungus beings. A few hours ago, they burst into my cabin and 
tried to kill us. During the struggle, someone knocked over a lantern 
and my cabin went up in flames. The blaze destroyed the creatures still 
trapped inside, but more emerged from the woods. They are the corpses of
 a party of farmers who sought the source of the fungus. Apparently, 
they found it.</p>
<p class="size2">We set the torch to Rael's body after it nearly broke 
free from the ropes. The Shandarin priest is dead. He stood his ground 
against the creatures, convinced that they were created by foul magicks,
 and perished when his faith could not stop them. Some of the other 
peasants were dragged screaming into the woods. Now the creatures pound 
incessantly at my barn doors. It's only a matter of time before they get
 through....</p>

<p class="size2"><i>*This number can be adjusted up or down depending on how many fungus minions the slaver fungus controls.</i></p>
<p class="size2">The main body of a slaver fungus looks like an enormous
 purplish-white mushroom with a very broad cap. The outer layer of the 
fungus is extremely tough, like the bark of a tree. Immediately beneath 
the cap are four large nodules that form the base of long, thin, tough 
tendrils. These tendrils extend into the underbrush, where they seek out
 and grapple prey. </p>
<p class="size2">The most insidious aspect of the slaver fungus is its 
ability to infect living creatures and transform them into walking 
plants that protect the main body. A fully-grown fungus constantly 
releases spores that blanket the area around it. These spores infect any
 creature that breathes them in, creating fungus minions: zombies 
animated not by negative energy, but the fungus that pervades their 
bodies.</p>
<p class="size2">Externally, fungus minions look as they did in life, 
but a dense, sickly, purplish-green fungus covers their skin and fills 
their eye sockets. They wear the tattered remains of any armor and 
clothing on their person at the time of death; it, too, is densely 
covered with fungus (and offers no additional protection). Internally, 
the fungus quickly moves through the victim's body, consuming tissue at a
 rapid rate until only an animated shell remains.</p>
<p class="size2">Animals of the forest are also commonly infected, shambling around alongside humanoid fungus minions.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A slaver fungus relies heavily on its minions (see 
below) to protect it from harm. It also uses its tendrils to drag 
victims within 30 feet of its main body, where they may become infected 
by the spores. If victims do not attack the main body of the fungus, it 
releases them and lets the infection slowly finish the kill.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Improved Grab (Ex): </b>If a slaver fungus hits an 
opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with 
three of its four tendril attacks, it attempts to start a grapple as a 
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus 
+27). If it gets a hold, it can transfer drag the opponent to within 15 
feet of its main body on its next turn. Alternatively, the slaver fungus
 has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its 
tendrils to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, but the 
fungus is not considered grappled).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Transforming Fungus (Ex):</b> A slaver fungus can 
release a cloud of spores that, if inhaled, turns living creatures into 
animated fungus. Any creature within 30 feet of a slaver fungus must 
make a Fortitude save (DC 23) each round or become infected with the 
fungus. Incubation takes 1 day; damage 1d6 temporary Constitution 
damage; 2d6 secondary Constitution damage. A <i>remove disease</i> or a successful Heal check (DC 25) stops the infection.</p>
<p class="size2">Victims whose Constitution reach 0 due to fungus damage
 die from their bodies becoming completely permeated with the fungus. 
Victims essentially become zombies per the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11552">Monster Manual</a></i>.
 However, the victims' type becomes "plant," not "undead," and they are 
not affected by any spells or effects that influence undead. Victims 
gain the plant traits and fire vulnerability listed below.</p>
<p class="size2">Should the transformation that creates a fungus zombie 
reach completion within five miles of the original slaver fungus, the 
zombie unerringly returns to the main body, stopping only to defend 
itself if attacked. If the transformation occurs beyond 5 miles, the 
fungus zombie attacks the closest living creature, then the next, 
continuing until it is destroyed. </p>
<p class="size2">Upon destruction, the zombie breaks into a cloud of spores. Unless destroyed by burning or <i>disintegrate,</i>
 the zombie may (1% chance) leave behind remains that become a new 
slaver fungus. It takes five years for the slaver fungus to reach 
maturity; it is completely harmless until that point.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fungus Minions</b>:<b></b>Fungus zombies (see above)
 who return to the slaver fungus that spawned them become fungus minions
 who instinctively protect it. At any given time, ten to twelve 
Medium-size fungus minions guard a slaver fungus and never stray farther
 than 50 yards from the main body.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Vulnerability (Ex):</b> Slaver fungi take 
double damage from fire attacks unless the attack allows a save, in 
which case they take double damage on a failure and no damage on a 
success.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Plant Traits (Ex): </b>A slaver fungus is immune to 
poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject 
to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature also has 
low-light vision to a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tendril Regeneration (Ex):</b> Foes can attack the 
tendrils of a slaver fungus, but only when those appendages are actually
 holding an opponent. A tendril has an AC of 21 (touch 10) and can 
withstand 18 points of damage. The loss of a tentacle does not harm the 
creature (that is, the damage does not apply against its hit point 
total), and the limb regrows within 1d6 days. </p>
