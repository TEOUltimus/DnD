<p class="size2">In response to your inquiry regarding the most recent 
raid upon our glorious city by surface dwellers, I am forced to concur 
with the learned Priestess Instra's conclusions. The raiders most 
certainly approached the city from below, no doubt to avoid the most 
heavily guarded and trapped passages.</p>
<p class="size2">They escaped by the same route once they had stolen 
your scepter. They succeeded, in part, because we lost several of the 
guards sent after them. The guards encountered something other than the 
raiders -- the few survivors claim the cave itself came alive and 
consumed their allies. I can only assume some creature unfamiliar to us 
has taken residence in the area.</p>
<p class="size2">I recommend the temple immediately authorize funds to 
hire mercenaries to cover these passages until we can construct a proper
 defensive fortification. The large caverns common in the lower levels 
could house as many as 400 warriors, and a small chapel nearby would 
allow your magnificence's priests to properly support them. In 
preparation for that effort, I have sent several explorers into the 
region to map the cave system and ascertain the nature of these new 
creatures. Attached, please find my estimated cost for extended 
operations, spread out as monthly expenses over the next four years.</p>
<p class="size2">Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="size2">Sorntran</p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2007-19%20-%20Lurker%20Above_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2">Lady of Highest and Darkest Glory,</p>
<p class="size2">I have received your missive outlining the reasons my 
proposal for the construction of a fortification and chapel were 
ill-advised, and most humbly apologize for wasting your time with such 
poorly conceived plans. Clearly the expense is prohibitive, and I would 
never suggest you spend the temple's funds to solve problems caused by 
my own or Priestess Instra's lack of planning.</p>
<p class="size2">Regarding your directive to find an alternative method 
for securing the lower levels of caves beneath our glorious city: The 
few members of the surveying party who survived managed to gain a rough 
idea of the caverns' extent, information that leads me to believe we can
 secure them by transplanting a modest number of spiders into the area. I
 have scouted out numerous wild spiders, ranging from 5 to 15 feet in 
body length, that I believe perfectly suit our needs. Once transplanted 
into the cave system, their natural predatory instincts and penchant for
 web spinning should provide a high degree of security.</p>
<p class="size2">Of course, since other living creatures rarely visit 
the area, this solution involves a small ongoing expense to provide food
 for the spiders to ensure their long-term survival. Additionally, an 
expedition needs to be undertaken to clear out the mysterious creatures 
living in the caves. Given the explorers' account and the number of 
casualties, I now conclude that at least four of these creatures -- 
rather than the one previously reported -- threaten us. However, since 
the creatures' coloring makes them difficult to spot in the pale rock of
 the deepest caverns, I suspect we will have more luck driving them out 
of the darker-toned near caverns.</p>
<p class="size2">By my own lowly hand,</p>
<p class="size2">Sorntran</p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2007-19%20-%20Lurker%20Above_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2">Dearest and Most Generous Matriarch,</p>
<p class="size2">Following the execution of Priestess Instra for vast 
cost overruns in the attempt to clear out the nearest caverns, I have 
put great effort into finding an alternative less taxing to the temple 
budget. One of the greatest impediments is the regular loss of any agent
 I send to examine the area in detail. Apparently the creatures, which I
 now believe number at least ten, are difficult to spot in any rock 
type. They are intelligent enough to avoid attacking large, well-armed 
parties, instead targeting individual agents separated from their units.
 This regular loss of mercenaries led to the vast unexpected expenses.</p>
<p class="size2">My new suggestion for securing the lower passages is to
 stop sending mercenaries into the lower caverns. Since the entire area 
is now inhabited by the mysterious ceiling-hugging camouflaged 
creatures, we can allow them to take care of any future raiders.</p>
<p class="size2">Should the creature population prove insufficient for 
the level of desired security, I recommend sending lower-cost agents to 
explore further. Recruits seem to be food enough to encourage the 
population to grow, and cost less than regular foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="size2">In Greatest Modesty,</p>
<p class="size2">Sorntran</p>

<p class="size2"><b>Description</b></p>
<p class="size2">The lurker above is an unusual creature found only in 
large subterranean areas. It is a flat creature generally 20 feet wide 
and 10 feet long, with two large eyes located near the center of its 
front edge. No more than a foot thick, it resembles a manta ray. Its 
skin is smooth, black and rubbery on the top, but its underside has the 
coloration and texture of stone. Over the course of a few days, the 
underside of a lurker above can shift in texture and color to appear to 
be almost any kind of rock.</p>
<p class="size2">Hundreds of tiny claws that emerge from its smooth top 
enable the lurker above to crawl along surfaces, but only very slowly. 
It generally prefers to fly, using its natural buoyancy and undulating 
its whole body as a wing to move with speed and grace in a motion very 
similar to swimming. A lurker above resorts to its tiny claws only when 
constricting prey; it can float while using them but cannot move 
horizontally.</p>
<p class="size2">A lurker above can enter a state similar to 
hibernation, enabling it to feed only once every few months. When food 
is plentiful, however, it is capable of eating many times its body 
volume in a single sitting. Its rough-textured underside conceals 
hundreds of tiny suckers used to consume food. The suckers, too small to
 bite prey, suck up victims that have been crushed into paste by the 
creature's entire body.</p>
<p class="size2">Most caverns are large enough to support only a single 
lurker above, but particularly enormous or well traveled caverns can 
support as many as five. A lurker above does not attack, eat or act 
against others of its kind; if food becomes too scarce, it moves on to 
new hunting grounds. A lurker above that has fed well and often enough 
to grow to Gargantuan size eventually enters a long stage of inactivity 
during which time it divides into 2-4 Medium-size young. The young reach
 maturity in 20-30 feedings, which can take as little as a few weeks or 
as long as a few years.</p>
<p class="size2">A lurker above does not itself have any use for coins 
or magic items, and finds most metals inedible. As a result many caves 
inhabited by the creatures develop a small pile of treasure left from 
victims. In some cases, the treasure pile acts as a lure for unwary 
subterranean humanoids, who themselves become victims of the lurker 
above.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">A lurker above attacks only to feed, but is almost 
always hungry. When at rest, it attaches itself to the ceiling of a 
large cave or cavern. Upon sensing prey (generally with its 
tremorsense), the lurker above becomes awake and alert. It positions 
itself over a target, then drops down to attack. A lurker above always 
attempts to grapple and constrict the largest target in a group, then 
levitate out of counterattack reach. If targets can attack the lurker 
above at range, it attempts to move its grappled target to one side of 
its body and make slam attacks against other targets.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A lurker above deals 1d8+12 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Improved Grab (Ex): </b>If a lurker above hits an 
opponent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a 
slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a
 free action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus 
+23). If it gets a hold, it constricts on the same round. Thereafter, 
the lurker above has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or 
simply use its body to hold the opponent (-20 penalty on grapple check, 
but the lurker above is not considered grappled). In either case, each 
successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically
 deals slam and constriction damage. A lurker above may not have more 
than one target grappled at a time.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Smother (Ex):</b> In addition to constricting its 
victim, a lurker above that has made a successful grapple check against a
 target cuts off all the prey's air. Targets being smothered use the 
same rule as for drowning: They can hold their breath for a number of 
rounds equal to twice their constitution. After this time, the target 
must make a Constitution check (DC 10) in order to continue holding its 
breath. Each round, the DC increases by 1.</p>
<p class="size2">When the target fails its Constitution check, it begins
 to suffocate. In the first round, it falls unconscious (0 hp). On the 
following round, it drops to -1 and is dying. In the third round, it 
succumbs and dies.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities (Ex):</b> Because of its rubbery hide and ability to stretch easily, a lurker above takes only half damage from bludgeoning attacks.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Levitate (Ex):</b> The body of a lurker above is 
naturally buoyant, allowing it to gain and lose altitude. Thus a lurker 
above may produce an effect like that of the <i>levitate</i> spell, as a free action, moving at a base speed of 20 feet.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scent (Ex): </b>The creature can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Tremorsense (Ex):</b> When attached to a rocky 
surface, a lurker above can automatically sense the location of anything
 within 180 feet that is in contact with the same rock. This capability 
enables a lurker above on the ceiling of a cavern to sense the approach 
of creatures walking across the bottom of the cavern.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills:</b> A lurker above gains a +4 racial bonus 
on Listen and Move Silently checks. *When attached to the ceiling in 
rocky areas with little vegetation, a lurker above gains a +12 racial 
bonus on Hide checks.</p>
