<p align="left">Glovis Veriqentz extended his <i>sighthelper IV</i> and 
surveyed the large cavern from the relative safety of the third balcony.
 The glow of fire beetle glands illuminated much of the cavern, making 
it easy to inspect the room. There was really only one word that could 
adequately describe the scene below: carnage. Glovis's brethren covered 
the floor of the cavern. Miners and guards alike lay everywhere. The 
burrower <i>Rockeater I</i> lay in a demolished heap near the center of 
the cavern. The pride of the Gnome Confederacy had been destroyed by 
Garl-knows-what, and Glovis had been selected to investigate the 
incident.</p>
<p align="left">The only gnome who had escaped the carnage was of little help. A miner by the name of Crindekalis Delvedeeper had ridden the <i>updown </i>all
 the way to the surface in a panicked haze. The only thing that he could
 tell Glovis was that everything had gone dark and then the "screaming 
and squishing" had started. Crindekalis had been the <i>updown</i> 
operator at the time, and had barely shut the doors and flipped the "Up"
 switch in time. Saving some of his compatriots had just not occurred to
 him at in the terror of the moment. </p>
<p align="left">Glovis sighed, pocketed the <i>sighthelper IV</i> and cast <i>arcane eye</i>, <i>invisibility, true seeing</i>, <i>stoneskin, </i>and<i> fly</i>.
 Glovis was always prepared. It was time to start checking out what had 
caused all this destruction and killed all of the gnomes. Glovis took 
off from the balcony and circled around the cavern in a shallow decline.
 The guards who had been waiting patiently behind Glovis made their way 
to the floor via the <i>updown.</i></p>
<p align="left">The scene that greeted him was gruesome to say the 
least. Bodies of gnomes lay everywhere; many had been torn in two by 
some powerful force or thrown violently against the walls of the cavern.
 <i>Rockeater I</i> had been battered and hammered with large rocks. Its expensive <i>Dimo-glass </i>shielding
 had been smashed in, and no operators were in sight. Glovis came to 
rest on the floor of the cavern. He directed the guards to touch nothing
 as they exited the <i>updown</i>. As he looked around with his improved
 senses, he realized that all the gnomes still had valuables on them -- 
rings and necklaces as well as weapons.</p>
<p align="left">Well, that ruled out the xorn,<i></i>which had been his 
first guess upon hearing Crindekalis's account. Glovis let out a deep 
sigh for the second time that day. He had led a team at the GIS (Gnome 
Investigative Service) for many years, and his forensic knowledge and 
attention to detail were unparalleled in the field. He had even cracked 
the famous "Some Stinkin' Elf Stole My Fabulous Jewel" case for the 
dwarves a few years ago (although the dwarf king had merely forgotten 
where he hid the "jewel" in question). But this incident looked like it 
was going to challenge even his expertise. He pulled out his <i>Measuromatic XXVI </i>and bent down to measure what appeared to be a rather large claw wound in an expired gnome. That's when everything went dark.</p>
<p align="left">. . . Or, at least, everything would have gone dark if Glovis had not been using <i>true seeing</i>.
 Actually, Glovis would have preferred if it had gone dark -- even 
though the fact that it had not gone dark had probably saved his life. 
But he did not have the time to reflect on this rationally. Rushing 
toward him was a large dark creature barely humanoid in shape. He could 
feel the malevolence it exuded like a physical blow.</p>
<p align="left">Glovis did what any well-trained GIS field agent would 
do. He panicked. He flew up as fast as he could. The creature stopped 
chasing him as soon as he left the ground and instead moved toward the 
guards. It used its large tri-clawed arms to grab at the gnomes. The 
guards' weapons had little effect on the creature.</p>
<p align="left">As soon as Glovis recovered his wits, he cast <i>force cage </i>on the creature. Then he <i>teleported </i>home to make his report.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><i>The hulking creature looks like a roughly humanoid, 
black-skinned biped with powerful long arms that end in a three-fingered
 prehensile claw. Its body is thin but muscular with thick legs. Its 
head is long and thin with large white eyes.</i></p>
<p align="left">A malgoren is an ebony fey creature of the deep earth. 
Unlike most other fey, a malgoren is a powerful and cunning fighter. 
Each malgoren dwells in a crystal-lined cavern that it jealously defends
 against trespassers. A malgoren is not only fiercely territorial, but 
hates all living things and destroys any who are unfortunate enough to 
venture into its realm.</p>
<p align="left">Despite their bloodthirsty ways, malgorens don't feed 
off flesh, but derive their sustenance from crystals. They never feed in
 their home caverns but venture forth to devour crystals elsewhere. 
Malgorens constantly hunt for crystal deposits, veins, or caverns to 
feed upon. Once they have exhausted the supply of crystal they move on, 
leaving large caverns in their wake. They are extremely xenophobic and 
have no dealings with other creatures. In fact, a malgoren will attack 
any creature that comes too close to its crystal cavern. While 
traveling, malgorens avoid all interaction or contact with other 
creatures, through occasionally several malgorens join forces to destroy
 any nonmalgorens they can find or to defend particularly rich veins of 
crystal.</p>
<p align="left">A typical malgoren stands 10 feet tall and weighs 600 
pounds. A malgoren's skin is ink black and extremely tough. It always 
appears as if it has an oily sheen to it. Malgorens have long, thin 
heads that slope forward, ending in a small oval mouth that has no 
teeth. Their eyes are large white ovals. Their long arms are very 
muscular and end in three six-inch claws.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">In combat, a malgoren is a cunning adversary, moving 
silently through stone until it can set up an ambush on the creatures 
that have invaded its space. It casts <i>darkness</i> as it exits the stone and rushes to grapple or rend the creatures with its two powerful arms. </p>
<p align="left">A malgoren speaks Terran and Sylvan.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Ex): </b>30 ft. radius, HD 18 or less, Will save DC 20 negates.<b></b>A malgoren can unsettle foes<b></b>with its mere presence.<b></b>The
 ability takes place automatically whenever a malgoren attacks or 
charges. (providing the being attacked can see the malgoren) Creatures 
within a 30-foot radius of the malgoren are subject to the effect if 
they have fewer HD then the malgoren. A potentially affected creature 
that succeeds in a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the malgoren's HD + the 
malgoren's Cha modifier) remains immune to that malgoren's frightful 
presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 10 or less Hit Dice 
become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 11 or more Hit Dice become
 shaken for 4d6 rounds. Malgoren ignore the frightful presence of other 
malgoren.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> A malgoren that hits with a 
claw attack may start a grapple as a free action without provoking an 
attack of opportunity. If it succeeds in its grapple a malgoren can rend
 an opponent on its next turn with a successful grapple check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rend (Ex): </b>If a malgoren hits with both claw 
attacks, it can latch onto its opponent's body and tear the flesh. This 
attack automatically deals an extra 2d8+10 points of damage. It also can
 rend with a successful grapple check once it has established a 
grappling hold.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>At will -- <i>darkness.</i> Caster level 9th</p>
<p align="left"><b>Earth Glide (Ex): </b>A malgoren can glide through 
stone as easily as a fish swims through water. It leaves behind no 
tunnel, nor does it leave behind any evidence of its presence. A <i>move earth </i>spell
 cast on a space containing a malgoren flings the malgoren back 20 feet,
 stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.</p>
