<p class="size2">The heat was unbearable. Quilix wiped the sweat from 
his brow with his sword hand and peered into the dim chamber. It was 
difficult to see, as acrid smoke and shimmering waves of heat obscured 
his vision. A dim red glow shone throughout the room, which he soon 
recognized as some sort of forge.</p>
<p class="size2">He stepped inside the room -- a cavern, really. For 
four days and nights, he had explored the shattered fortress of the 
salamanders. The dwarves that lived near this site had believed it to be
 long forgotten by its former masters, and so far, Quilix's 
investigations had proved him correct. All he had found in the deep, 
smoldering halls of salamanders, located dangerously close to the 
volcano known as Mount Drukk, was ash, ancient charred bodies, and a 
great deal of heat.</p>
<p class="size2">A huge, squat anvil sat in the middle of the room, 
scarred from what must have been centuries of use. Bits of metal and 
half-finished metal weapons were piled in metal racks, now drooping from
 age and constant exposure to heat. A pool of lava bubbled in a stone 
vat in the corner, no doubt being fed from one of the many tendrils of 
magma that seeped from the volcano. </p>
<p class="size2">Seeing nothing of immediate value in the forge to be 
looted, Quilix turned to leave. A flicker from the anvil suddenly caught
 his eye. He moved closer and saw a strange, octagonal stone fixed in 
the side of the anvil. He wiped off the soot and ash that covered the 
stone, and gave out a startled gasp of surprise. The stone was an 
enormous ruby the size of his fist! Quilix's hands shook as he sheathed 
his sword and drew his dagger from its scabbard. He began to pry the 
ruby from its setting.</p>
<p class="size2">"What a prize this will fetch from the dwarves at Duruk
 Lor!" he murmured as his dagger dug into the decaying metal of the 
anvil.</p>
<p class="size2">Deep in thought, Quilix failed to hear the sound of 
rustling from behind him -- the noise of coals settling into a fire. The
 ruby came loose from its fitting and he held it up in the red-orange 
light of the magma pool, a smile of pure greed on his face.</p>
<p class="size2">The smile faded quickly when he noticed a shifting in 
the sparkle of the ruby, alerting him to something moving behind him. In
 a flash, he pivoted, the dagger held low and ready to strike. He 
stopped cold and looked into the glowing red eyes of the monstrosity 
before him.</p>
<p class="size2">The coal golem released an infernal, crackling hiss, 
blowing hellishly hot air into Quilix's face. The dagger fell from his 
trembling hands as the golem raised its massive, glowing fists, ready to
 deal a killing blow to the intruder who had desecrated the forge. </p>

<p class="size2">Fire-dwelling races that thrive in intensely hot 
environments commonly create coal golems. The secret to the creation of 
coal golems is believed to have been first discovered by the 
salamanders, who used the coals and slag from their infernal forges to 
give life to these monsters. If not the true creators, salamanders are 
the usual masters of coal golems, using them as slave labor and as 
guardians of their forges. Fire giants that have mastered the arcane 
arts also manufacture coal golems, sometimes for the sole purpose of 
using them as mobile statues to decorate their fortresslike dwellings. 
Sages believe that unlike other golems, which receive life through the 
power of the element of earth, coal golems are animated by a combination
 of fire and earth energies. Because of these conflicting energies, a 
coal golem is more likely than other constructs to go on a berserk 
killing rampage.</p>
<p class="size2">A coal golem is a humanoid-shaped figure composed of 
deep-burning coals and cinders. It stands 9 feet tall, weighs 500 
pounds, and has a powerful body with stocky legs and arms that extend to
 its knees. An open iron frame holds the entire body in place. Tiny bits
 of ash and sparks, which can light paper and other easily ignited 
objects, constantly "shed" from the coal golem's body. Two particularly 
large glowing cinders act as the coal golem's eyes.</p>
<p class="size2">Coal golems cannot speak but make a crackling hiss when
 attacking. They understand commands spoken in the Ignan tongue but do 
not understand Common. The creatures emit a constant wisp of smoke, 
equivalent to a low-burning campfire. They move in a slow, clumsy gait, 
accompanied by the sounds of crackling embers and shifting coals. The 
coal golem is typically armed with an enormous metal longspear, which 
glows red from the golem's heat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>COMBAT</b></p>
<p class="size2">A coal golem will engage in close combat, where its 
impressive heat can do extra damage, as soon as possible. It will also 
try to set fire to flammable objects, making the surrounding environment
 dangerous. It gets enraged by cold attacks and focuses its attention on
 anyone who attacks with such methods, even if those attacks do no 
significant harm. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Heat (Ex):</b> A coal golem generates so much heat 
that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Coal golems can 
conduct this heat through any metal objects or weapons they carry. This 
heat also has a chance to light flammable objects on fire (see Catching 
on Fire in Chapter 3 of the <i><b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11551">Dungeon Master</a></b><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11551">'s Guide</a></i>).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Berserk (Ex):</b> When a coal golem enters combat, 
there is a cumulative 2% chance each round that its elemental spirit 
breaks free and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, 
attacking the nearest living creature or smashing (and/or lighting on 
fire) some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach. It
 then moves on to spread more destruction. If within 60 feet, the 
golem's creator can try to regain control by speaking firmly and 
persuasively (in Ignan) to the golem, an act which requires a successful
 Charisma check (DC 19). It takes 1 minute of rest by the golem to reset
 its berserk chance to 0%.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Construct Traits</b>: A coal golem is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep,</i>
 paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and 
any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on 
objects. The creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, 
ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive 
damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through repair. It 
cannot be raised or resurrected. A coal golem has darkvision (60-foot 
range).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Magic Immunity (Ex)</b>: A coal golem is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows. An <i>ice storm</i> slows it (as the <i>slow</i> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. C<i>one of cold</i> slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 damage. O<i>tiluke's freezing sphere</i>
 stops it from moving that round and does regular damage. A fire effect 
breaks any slow effect on the golem and cures 1 point of damage for each
 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. For example, a coal golem 
hit by a fireball cast by a 5th-level wizard gains back 6 hit points if 
the damage total is 18. The golem rolls no saving throw against fire 
effects.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Construction</b></p>
<p class="size2">A coal golem's body is made of an open iron frame, 
which contains the chunks of coals and cinders that make up its form. 
These coals are made from burning rare woods and coals. The golem costs 
65,000 gp create, including 1,000 for the construction of the body. 
Creating the body is a complex task that requires a successful Craft 
(metalworking or weaponsmithing) check (DC 20).</p>
<p class="size2">The creator must have attained 14th level and be able 
to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 1,100 XP from the 
creator and requires<i> geas/quest, limited wish, polymorph any object, heat metal.</i> The creator must also speak Ignan.</p>
