<p class="size2"><i>"Over there, Scout. That's her." Miala pointed at 
the enchantingly beautiful creature seated in the clearing. The fairy --
 for surely that was what it must be -- sat surrounded by four human 
males in their early twenties, each clearly bewitched. "See the twisted 
trees on the far side of the clearing? She causes that. She's some kind 
of nymph."</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>"So why didn't you just kill her?" Scout asked, drawing an arrow from her quiver. "It seems easy enough, if she's just a nymph."</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>"My powers are considerable now, but with those 
louts fawning at her feet, I would have been in over my head when it 
came to blows. I left the dogs behind so I could move quietly. And I 
don't have your gift for archery -- you know that."</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>Scout fitted the arrow to her bow, then drew the 
string back and took aim from behind the brush. Her clothing made her 
six-foot frame meld with the brush, and Miala's leaf armor caused her to
 actually appear to be part of the bush. Taking careful aim, Scout said,
 "After we kill it, will the forest return to normal?"</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>"I don't know; I've never run into one of these. I 
was able to tell that she was causing the corruption only by observing 
her for more than a week. And she's not dead yet, friend. . . ."</i></p>
<p class="size2"><i>At that moment, Scout let the arrow fly. The twang 
of the bowstring echoed through the woods as the arrow sped toward its 
target. Suddenly, one of the men around the nymph turned and interposed 
himself between the arrow and its target. As he fell screaming, the 
others produced clubs and swords, and turned towards the two women in 
the brush. Scout and Miala drew their own weapons and readied 
themselves. Miala said, "It's getting to the 'after' that's always hard 
for us."</i></p>

<p class="size2">As beautiful as nymphs, unseelie nymphs are their exact
 opposites in outlook and temperament. They delight in the corruption of
 all that is beautiful and good in nature.</p>
<p class="size2">Unseelie nymphs can be found in both forest and aquatic
 environments, working their destruction. Each has a chosen terrain that
 it prefers; forest unseelie nymphs live only in forests, and aquatic 
unseelie nymphs live only at lakeshores or in lakes. They will not 
willingly live in other terrain; even forest unseelie nymphs will not 
live near a lakeshore that is contained within the home forest.</p>
<p class="size2">An unseelie nymph's beauty rivals, but does not quite 
equal, the beauty of a good nymph. However, few get the opportunity to 
compare them side-by-side, and so the subtle differences are not 
apparent. Unseelie nymphs resemble young human or elven women with 
perfect features and thick, luxurious hair. Forest unseelie nymphs tend 
toward brown or black hair, while water-dwelling individuals have blond 
or a greenish-blue hair that looks just as lovely and appropriate as the
 more normal hair colors. This beauty hides a heart as corrupt and evil 
as can be found in the natural world, and the sardonic or hard glints in
 these creatures' eyes are so fleeting that almost no one sees them. An 
unseelie nymph never betrays her evil tendencies overtly, always 
maintaining an appearance of innocence. Because of this, they are often 
confused with nymphs who have turned off their unearthly beauty's deadly
 effects.</p>
<p class="size2">Unseelie nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">Unseelie nymphs avoid combat, relying on their 
love-stricken companions to defend and protect them. When bereft of such
 servitors, they seek to escape combat unscathed. Though they are 
spiteful about destroying the beauty of others, they prize their own 
beauty too highly to risk it in combat.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><i>Charm</i> (Sp): </b>Any creature who sees the unseelie nymph must make a Will save (DC 17) or fall in love with her. This ability works as the <i>charm person</i>
 spell cast by a 7th-level sorcerer. If the creature is male, he treats 
the unseelie nymph as the love of its life, the center of his universe, 
and will do anything short of ending his own life, or violating his 
basic ethos, to please the unseelie nymph. Those charmed by an unseelie 
nymph will not leave her side while the charm is in effect for any 
reason, and will defend her to the death. (Note: Defending one's love to
 the death is different than throwing oneself off a cliff simply because
 the beloved wished one to do so.)</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Corruption of Nature (Su)</b>: An unseelie nymph can
 twist and corrupt nature itself. For every week that an unseelie nymph 
lives in an area, she twists, deforms, and kills the plants, and fouls 
the water. Fouled water cannot support life, so fish in a lake that 
becomes fouled by the unseelie nymph die the following week. The 
unseelie nymph first affects the area around her designated "home," and 
extends her influence in circular patterns of increasing size. Each week
 the unseelie nymph can corrupt a circle of radius 150 feet, but 
successive weeks' circles add on to the first. Thus, in the first week 
the unseelie nymph corrupts a circle of radius 150 feet centered on her 
home. The following week, the circle of area affected grows to a radius 
of 300 feet, and in the following week the circle of effect grows to a 
radius of 450 feet. The maximum area that can be affected by a single 
unseelie nymph is a circle with radius 2 miles, and this takes 71 weeks 
to accomplish. Any plant in the area that is sentient and self-willed or
 controlled by another creature, such as a druid's oak or a treant, can 
make a Fortitude save (DC 11) to resist the effect each week that it 
remains in the area. Creatures that make this saving throw cannot 
identify the source of the effect simply from being attacked by it.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Corruption of Beauty (Su)</b>: Once per week, an 
unseelie nymph can permanently drain one point of Charisma and one point
 of Constitution from any creatures under the effects of its <i>charm</i>
 ability. The range of this ability is 30 feet, and the affected 
creatures can make a Fortitude save (DC 17) to resist this effect. Males
 receive a -2 circumstance penalty to this saving throw, as they would 
willingly give the unseelie nymph anything it requests.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Spell-like Abilities (Sp)</b>: Unseelie nymphs can use <i>dimension door</i> once per day as cast by a 7th-level sorcerer.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>*Terrain-Dependent Skill</b>: Unseelie nymphs who 
have chosen water as their home have ranks in the Swim skill, and those 
who have chosen the forest as their home have ranks in the Climb skill. 
Unseelie nymphs receive a +4 racial bonus on checks using their 
terrain-dependent skill.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Ability Focus</b></p>
<p class="size2">Choose one of your special attacks. This attack becomes more potent than normal.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit:</b> Add +2 to the Difficult Class for all saving throws against the special attack you select to focus on.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. 
Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a 
new special attack.</p>
