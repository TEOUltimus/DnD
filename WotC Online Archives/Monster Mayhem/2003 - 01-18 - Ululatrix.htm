<p class="size2">The hunter came in the night on silent wings -- eyes, 
ears, and nose tuned to the slightest hint of prey. A night breeze 
brought the scents of a shepherd and his flock to the hunter's nose, and
 soon it could see and hear the human and his dogs keeping their vigil. 
With practiced ease, the hunter lighted, silent as an autumn leaf, 
downwind of its prey. It settled down to wait, veiled in dark night, 
patient as a cat at a mouse hole. It knew the ways of shepherds and 
their dogs.</p>
<p class="size2">Presently, a few restless sheep began to stray from the
 flock. The dogs sprang into action even before the watchful shepherd 
could issue a command. Circling the flock in opposite directions, the 
dogs urged the strays back into the fold. Still unseen and unscented in 
the darkness, the hunter breathed deep, then began a soft, trilling 
song. The approaching dogs halted and pricked their ears. Both found the
 hunter's song strangely compelling. With a yawn, one dog settled down 
for a nap, first turning itself around three times in the fashion of 
dogs. The second dog, confused, barked once, then sank to its belly. The
 warning sent the flock speeding away, with the shepherd calling to his 
dogs and running desperately to keep up.</p>
<p class="size2">Almost lazily, the hunter sprang into the air and 
dropped onto the hapless dog. Long, curving talons sank into the animal 
like spears. The dog had time for one frightened yelp before it was 
lifted into the air and tossed aside like a discarded doll. It pitched 
back to earth, hit with a sickening thud, and lay still. Meanwhile, its 
companion slept on.</p>
<p class="size2">The shepherd spun on his heel the moment he heard the 
dog's yelp. With a throaty cry he charged into the darkness, brandishing
 his staff.</p>
<p class="size2">The hunter regarded the desperate human for a 
heartbeat, then took to the air, an unseen shadow against the stars. By 
the time the shepherd found the dog's broken body, the hunter was flying
 calmly away, bearing a choice, fat lamb in its talons.</p>

<p class="size2">The ululatrix, sometimes known as the screeching 
dragon, is a crafty brute, well capable of concealing its presence until
 it strikes.</p>
<p class="size2">The creature clearly shows its draconic heritage. It 
has vast, leathery wings, and its long, scaly body ends in a thin, 
whiplike tail with a clump of wicked-looking spines at the tip. Its neck
 is long and thick. Its head has a toothy maw with fleshy barbels 
hanging loosely from the jaws and chin. Spiny frills, starting just 
behind the eyes and jaws, ring the top of its head continue down the 
upper third of the neck. The spines supporting the frills command a wide
 range of motion, allowing the creature to make its frills stand 
straight out, lay flat against its body, or even curve forward slightly.
 The creature has four legs, the front pair much smaller than the hind 
legs. It usually walks on its hind feet, though it can move on all 
fours. In the latter position, an ululatrix has a hunched and awkward 
appearance.</p>
<p class="size2">The ululatrix's natural coloration is an overall pale 
green or blue. Dagger-shaped dark turquoise stripes run from the spine 
down along the creature's flanks, tapering to jagged points near the 
belly. The head and frills are dark green or black. The ululatrix can 
alter its own color, and often turns red or black when angry or excited.
 </p>
<p class="size2">The ululatrix lives primarily by hunting, but it isn't 
above scavenging or stealing food from weaker predators when the 
opportunity arises. It often hunts far from its lair, where it can seize
 prey and fly off before anyone is aware of its presence. The ululatrix 
can speak Draconic but seldom bothers to do so. It also can reproduce 
most sounds it hears.</p>
<p class="size2">Some scholars, citing the creature's blue coloration 
and ability to mimic sounds, believe that the ululatrix is a relative of
 the blue dragon. Others, pointing out the shape of creature's body and 
its physical capabilities, contend that the ululatrix is related to the 
wyvern. It is likely that both assertions are true, at least in part. 
Scholars also hotly debate the creature's origin. Is the ululatrix the 
recent product of draconic crossbreeding? Or is it a more ancient 
creature, heretofore unnoticed thanks to its stealthy ways and its 
similarities to wyverns and true dragons? No one knows for sure.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p class="size2">The ululatrix prefers hit and run tactics, usually 
striking from ambush or from the air (often a combination of both). It 
is fond of luring travelers to their doom by mimicking the voices of 
their companions. An ululatrix typically starts a battle with some kind 
of sonic attack and thereafter fights with its claws and teeth. It can 
slash with its talons only when making a flyby attack.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Mimicry (Ex)</b>: An ululatrix can mimic any voice 
or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must succeed at a 
Will save (DC 17) to detect the ruse. The save is Charisma-based.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Sonics (Su):</b> An ululatrix can produce several 
powerful sonic effects. When it uses a sonic attack, it must wait 1d4 
rounds before using another one. All the effects listed below are sonic 
effects except for the trill, which is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Shriek:</i> Every creature (except other 
ululatrixes) within a 60-foot cone must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 20)
 or take 3d6 points of sonic damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Screech:</i> Every creature (except other 
ululatrixes) within a 60-foot spread must succeed at a Fortitude save 
(DC 20) or become deafened and paralyzed. An affected creatures is 
deafened for 1d4+1 rounds, and also paralyzed for the first round of the
 effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Sonic Lance:</i> The ululatrix focuses sonic energy 
in a ray up to 60 feet long. This is a ranged touch attack that deals 
6d6 points of damage to a single target. The ululatrix's ranged attack 
bonus is +16.</p>
<p class="size2"><i>Trill:</i> The ululatrix produces a strangely 
soothing sound in a 60-foot spread. Every creature (except other 
ululatrixes) within a 60-foot spread must make a successful Will save 
(DC 17) or become completely calm. A creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice 
falls asleep for 2d4 rounds. A creature with 5 or more Hit Dice is dazed
 for the same period. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Dragon Traits:</b> An ululatrix is immune to sleep 
and paralysis effects. It has darkvision (60-foot range) and low-light 
vision (sees four times as well as a human in low-light conditions and 
twice as well in normal conditions).</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Immunities (Ex): </b>An ululatrix's sense of 
hearing, and indeed is entire body, is protected from sonic shocks of 
all kinds. Also, its own mastery of sound mimicry makes its sensitive to
 false or misleading sounds. These qualities make an ululatrix immune to
 any sonic effect.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Scent (Ex): </b>An ululatrix can detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills:</b> An ululatrix receives a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks, thanks to its variable coloration.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Feats: </b>If an ululatrix gets a hold on a creature
 two or more sizes smaller than itself using the Snatch feat (grapple 
bonus +28), it can pick up the creature and fly away with it. A creature
 that is flung by an ululatrix after being snatched travels 30 feet and 
takes 3d6 points of damage. If the ululatrix is flying, the creature 
takes this damage or the appropriate falling damage, whichever is 
greater. (See below for details of the Snatch feat.)</p>
<p class="size2">From <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88268">Monster Manual II</a></i>: </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Snatch [General]</b></p>
<p class="size2">The creature can grapple more easily with its claws or bite.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Claws or bite as a natural attack.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Benefit: </b>A creature with this feat that hits 
with a claw or bite attack attempts to start a grapple as a free action 
without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it gets a hold with a 
claw on a creature four or more size categories smaller than itself, it 
squeezes each round for automatic claw damage. If it gets a hold with 
its bite on a creature three or more size categories smaller than 
itself, it automatically deals bite damage each round, or if it does not
 move and takes no other action in combat, it deals double bite damage. 
The snatched creature gets no saving throw against the creature's breath
 weapon, if any.</p>
<p class="size2">The creature can drop a foe is has snatched as a free 
action or use a standard action to fling it aside. The feet traveled and
 the damage taken by a flung foe are specified in the creature's 
descriptive text. If the foe is flub while the creature is flying, the 
foe takes the specified amount of damage or falling damage, whichever is
 greater. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Normal:</b> Without this feat, the creature must conduct grapple attempts according to Chapter 8 of the <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11550">Player's Handbook</a>.</i></p>
