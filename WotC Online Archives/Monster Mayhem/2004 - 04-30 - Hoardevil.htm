<p align="LEFT">The strange tracks in the snow told a tale both familiar
 and peculiar, and the hunter frowned as he stooped to examine them more
 closely. Myriad tracks made by dainty hooves crisscrossed the area -- 
deer tracks. A small herd had been feeding here, but something -- almost
 certainly a predator -- had scattered the deer. Nothing unusual in 
that. The animals had fled in a body, bounding through the underbrush in
 graceful leaps. Nothing unusual in that, either. But the beast pursuing
 them -- now that was another matter. Its tracks were difficult to spot,
 but the hunter's trained eye found them with only a bit of effort. The 
creature seemed to move on two legs, leaving deep prints similar to 
those of a rabbit, though it obviously outsized the fleeing deer. Its 
tracks plunged deep into the snow and appeared nearly side-by-side, as 
though the creature had moved by crouching and leaping. Here and there, 
blurry marks paralleled the trail. To the hunter's experienced eye, they
 seemed reminiscent of a fox trail, since the fox's tail leaves shallow 
brush marks from time to time in deep snow. These marks, however, looked
 much deeper and quite crisp, as though they had been produced by a long
 and snaky appendage.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Intrigued, the hunter followed the tracks, intent on 
discovering just what sort of creature might have left such a trail. A 
short time later, he had his answer. The leaping predator had overtaken a
 doe in less than three dozen leaps, and there it stood, feeding on the 
carcass. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The predator was as white as the surrounding snow, 
except for small black spots randomly dotting its hide. Its body was 
long and lean, something like that of a great rat. The creature stood 
upright on massive hind feet and had a long, furred tail. And as if the 
oddly shaped body, feet, and tail weren't bizarre enough, the creature 
had a bony head shaped like that of a flesh-eating insect. Its powerful 
mandibles tore great chunks from the carcass, cutting though flesh and 
bone as cleanly as an axe. </p>
<p align="LEFT">But the hunter had only a moment to note these details. 
Suddenly, the feeding creature raised its head and loosed an angry hiss 
that sounded like a regiment of scalded cats. The hunter had never heard
 such a sound, but he recognized the action as a predator warning rivals
 to stay away from its kill. The hunter considered his few weapons and 
his thin armor and wisely decided to withdraw without annoying the 
strange creature any further.</p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Hoardevil</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>This bizarre creature is the size of a riding horse, 
with small forelegs, overdeveloped rear legs, and haunches like a 
rabbit's. It has a smooth, pale hide spotted with black, and a long, 
thick tail covered with short fur. A bony plate covers its chest like a 
discarded remnant of plate mail. Its head and neck resemble those of an 
insect, and its mouth is framed by deadly looking mandibles.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT">The kangaroolike hoardevil is an ill-tempered omnivore 
that can and will eat almost anything. Though it lives mostly on berries
 and leaves, it also scavenges and takes live prey when it can. Most 
hoardevils are solitary, though younger ones often form small companies.
 The creature's name derives from its predilection for cold environments
 and its nasty temperament. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The hoardevil is sexually dimorphic -- that is, the male and female have different appearances and abilities. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">A hoardevil usually attacks with a vicious bite. It also
 can make a slam attack with its chestplate, but it cannot deliver both 
attacks during the same round. </p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Male Hoardevil</b></p>

<p align="LEFT">An adult male hoardevil stands about 6 feet tall and 
weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. Its tail adds another 6 feet to its 
total length. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Usually, a male hoardevil begins a battle by using his 
powerful charge ability, slamming the opponent with his bony chestplate.
 Thereafter, he engages his foes in melee, attacking with his bite. The 
creature's rage ability usually ensures that he fights to the death. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Powerful Charge (Ex): </b>A male hoardevil typically 
begins a battle by charging at an opponent and making a slam attack with
 his bony chest. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a 
charge, this tactic allows him to make a single slam attack that deals 
2d8+7 points of damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rage (Ex):</b> A male hoardevil that takes damage in 
combat flies into a berserk rage on his next turn, biting madly until 
either he or his opponent is dead. He gains +4 to Strength, +4 to 
Constitution, and -2 to Armor Class. He cannot end his rage prematurely.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While the male hoardevil rages, the following changes to
 the above statistics are in effect: HD 5d10+20; hp 47; AC 15, touch 9, 
flat-footed 13; Grp +16; Atk +11 melee (1d8+10, bite); Full Atk +11 
melee (1d8+10, bite); SA powerful charge 2d8+10; Fort +8, Str 25, Con 
18; Jump +17.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> A hoardevil has a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Listen checks.</p>

<p align="LEFT">The female hoardevil looks like a slightly smaller and 
lighter version of the male, except that a pair of gossamer wings 
sprouts from her back. Furthermore, the female's bony chestplate hides 
the opening of a pouch in her abdomen, which she uses to carry her 
young.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Like a male hoardevil, a female usually begins a battle 
by using her powerful charge ability to slam the opponent with her bony 
chestplate. Since the female can fly, however, she often uses the 
withdraw action to fly away, then swoop down to make another powerful 
charge.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Powerful Charge (Ex): </b>A female hoardevil 
typically begins a battle by charging at an opponent and making a slam 
attack with her bony chest. In addition to the normal benefits and 
hazards of a charge, this tactic allows her to make a single slam attack
 that deals 2d8+7 points of damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills:</b> A hoardevil has a +4 racial bonus on Jump and Listen checks.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>About the Author</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The hoardevil was created at Uncon '03 -- a live chat 
gaming convention on the Wizards of the Coast website. Penny Williams, 
formerly a managing editor in Wizards of the Coast's RPG R&amp;D 
department, led a workshop-style seminar in which patrons built a 
monster, as a group, step-by-step. The finished product was playtested 
at the convention and featured in Knowledge Arcana, the website's 
newsletter. Skip Williams then took over, making a few changes with his 
developer's eye and adding a bit of history for the <i>Monster Mayhem</i> column. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Skip Williams keeps busy with freelance projects for several different game companies and has been <i>Dragon Magazine</i>'s Sage since 1986. Skip is a codesigner of the <b>D&amp;D</b> 3rd edition game and the chief architect of the <i>Monster Manual.</i>
 When not devising swift and cruel deaths for player characters, Skip 
putters in his kitchen or garden. (His borscht gets rave reviews.)</p>
