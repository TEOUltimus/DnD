<p class="size2">Classical mythology holds numerous examples of 
multiheaded monsters, from the Hydra to the Chimera to Cerberus, the 
three-headed hound that guards the gates of Hades. The chimera and hydra
 are well represented in the <b>D&amp;D</b><i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?TSR11552">Monster Manual</a>,</i> but there's no sign of Cerberus. Of course, Cerberus is a unique creature that more appropriately belongs in <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?88165">Deities and Demigods</a>,</i> but what if you want something similar as a whole race in your games?</p>
<p class="size2">Considering such creatures hell hounds at the top of 
their advancement range (8d8) comes close to defining the monster -- 
except for those extra heads. Just adding an extra bite attack to make a
 creature two-headed does not seem in keeping with the unique mythic 
nature of many multiheaded creatures. They should instead stand as 
paragons of their base species, possessing additional hit dice and all 
the improvements that go with them, in addition to multiple bites, gore 
attacks, and even breath weapons. To help Dungeon Masters create their 
own multiheaded creatures, I present the "multiheaded" template.</p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Multiheaded Creatures</b></i></p>
<p class="size2">Be they freaks of nature, the results of arcane 
experimentation, or simply a new race, some creatures have more heads 
than do common examples of their kind. Many multiheaded creatures are 
actually crossbreeds with some amount of hydra blood magically infused 
into them. All multiheaded creatures are more powerful and dangerous 
than similar creatures with fewer heads, and many become local legends.</p>
<p class="size2">It is not unusual for multiheaded creatures to be 
trained as guards and watchmen, as their increased number of eyes and 
noses equips them well for such tasks. However, a creature's heads don't
 always get along with each other, and this characteristic can make 
multiheaded guardians extremely unpredictable. In many cases, such 
creatures are simply forced into lairs nearby a stronghold, perhaps 
covering one of its secret entrances.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Creating a Multiheaded Creature</b></p>
<p class="size2">"Multiheaded" is a template that can be added to any 
corporeal creature with a discernable head. Animals with this template 
become beasts, but otherwise their type remains unchanged. If the base 
creature has different types of heads (such as a chimera), determine a 
specific type for each head. (Special Attacks are determined by head 
type in these cases.) Up to seven heads may be added to a base creature.
 Multiheaded creatures use all the base creature's statistics and 
special abilities except as noted below.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Hit Dice:</b> Each additional head adds 2 HD to the base creature.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>AC:</b> Increase natural armor by +1 per additional head.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Attack:</b> Creatures with bite or gore attacks gain one additional bite or gore attack per additional head.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special Attacks:</b> Base creatures who use weapons 
gain superior Two-Weapon Fighting. This feat allows them to use two 
weapons without any penalty to attack or damage. Base creatures with 
breath weapons or gaze attacks, or who can swallow whole, gain the 
ability to use that power with each head simultaneously. Special attacks
 (improved grab, poison, sonic attacks) related to a creature's head can
 be used with all heads at once.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Special Qualities:</b> Multiheaded creatures have darkvision to 90 ft.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Saves:</b> Same as base creature.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Abilities:</b> Base creature's Constitution is increased by +2 per additional head.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Skills:</b> Each additional head grants the creature
 a +2 racial bonus to Listen, Search and Spot checks. The creature also 
gains any additional skill points to which its additional Hit Dice would
 entitle it, according to its type.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Feats:</b> Base creatures with a bite attack gain 
Weapon Focus (bite) as a bonus feat. The creature also gains any 
additional feat slots to which its additional Hit Dice would entitle it,
 according to its type.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Climate/Terrain:</b> Same as base creature</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Organization:</b> Solitary</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Challenge Rating:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="size2">1 additional head, +2 <br> 2-4 additional heads, +3<br> 5-7 additional heads, +4<br> +1 additional per head-based special attack of base creature</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="size2"><b>Treasure:</b> As base creature</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Alignment:</b> Always chaotic</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Advancement:</b> Same as base creature</p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2006-21%20-%20Two%20Heads%20Are%20Better%20Than%20One...and%20Three%20Are%20Better%20Than%20Two_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Lernaean, Pyro- and Cryo- Creatures</b></i></p>
<p class="size2">Some multiheaded creatures have abilities similar to 
those possessed by the magic forms of hydras. Each type has a different 
ability.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Lernaean Creatures</b></p>
<p class="size2">These multiheaded creatures have bodies that are immune
 to attack (but see below). The only way to slay a Lernaean creature is 
to sever all its heads. However, each time a head is severed, two new 
heads spring from the stump in 1d4 rounds. A Lernaean creature may never
 have more than twice its original number of heads, and any heads it 
gains beyond that number wither and die within a day.</p>
<p class="size2">To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, 
at least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the stump (AC 
19) before the new heads appear.</p>
<p class="size2">Spells such as <i>disintegrate</i>, <i>finger of death</i>, and <i>slay living</i>
 kill a Lernaean creature outright if they succeed. If the spell deals 
damage on a successful save, that damage is directed against one of the 
creature's heads.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Pyro Creatures</b></p>
<p class="size2">These reddish creatures can breathe jets of fire 10 
feet high, 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. All heads breath once every 
1d4 rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 points of damage per head. A successful 
Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the creature's 
number of heads + the creature's Con modifier. The creature also gains 
the fire subtype.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Fire Subtype (Ex):</b> Fire immunity; double damage from cold except on a successful save.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Cryo Creatures</b></p>
<p class="size2">These purplish creatures can breath jets of frost 10 
feet high, 10 feet wide and 20 feet long. All heads breath once every 
1d4 rounds. Each jet deals 3d6 damage per head. A successful Reflex save
 halves the damage. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the creature's number of 
heads + the creature's Con modifier. The creature also gains the cold 
subtype.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Cold Subtype (Ex):</b> Cold immunity; double damage from fire except on a successful save.</p>
<p class="size2"><b><img src="2002%20-%2006-21%20-%20Two%20Heads%20Are%20Better%20Than%20One...and%20Three%20Are%20Better%20Than%20Two_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size2"><i><b>Sample Multiheaded Creatures</b></i></p>
<p class="size2">The first sample uses an 8-HD hell hound to create a 
Cerberus knock-off. The second is a horrifying combination of hydra and 
gorgon using the gorgon as the base creature and adding seven heads.</p>
