 there it sat -- the biggest, ugliest, nastiest, stankiest humanoid I 
had ever seen. Its enormous rump had bent and broken a sapling. 
Thoughtless, that. </p>
<p class="size2">A harem of flies danced around it in an orgy of filth. 
It ate a few of them, just grabbed them out of the air and popped them 
into its mouths. How convenient to have your snacks circling in the air 
about your head. The sight turned my stomach, and I, Cuthbert the 
Curious, sorcerer, hero, explorer extraordinaire, have seen some 
excruciatingly disgusting things in my life.</p>
<p class="size2">Yes, I had stumbled upon an ettin. Ettins stand rather 
tall and have brawny bodies, unlike my own compact, lean, and toned 
self. I presume many would classify them as giants. They have two heads 
and half a brain between them. Not half in each -- one half split 
between two heads. This ettin scolded and whined to itself in some 
twisted language of grunts and growls and throat clearings.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Brains vs. Brawn</b></p>
<p class="size2">Well, I had never dealt with an ettin before, and being
 the curious, cavalier gentleman that I am, I determined I would test 
this fellow's mettle. I stood from behind my rock, renouncing any chance
 of sneaking away or taking it by surprise, and bravely shouted, "Hey, 
you!" When one head looked up at me, I pointed at the other and shouted,
 "Not you! Him!"</p>
<p class="size2">I barely managed to duck the longspear! I dropped back 
down behind my rock and covered my head. So much for confounding the 
enemy with my superior wit. In the next moment, my heart seized with 
complete and utter horror. I heard it running. No. I both heard and <i>felt</i>
 it running -- running fast with those big, heavy, thunderous, giant 
footsteps -- toward my hiding place. Can you imagine my terror when 
faced with those far too quick, far too earth-shaking footfalls? I had 
to act without hesitation.</p>
<p class="size2">I rolled to one side, out into the open, and, by luck 
alone, avoided the slam of a greatclub over the top of that rock. I 
breathed the words of command and waved my hands, casting the spell that
 rose foremost to my mind. A layer of slippery grease spread across the 
ground at the giant's feet. I suppose I could have chosen a more 
offensive effect, but I was under pressure.</p>
<p class="size2">The ettin roared and fell backward. The earth shuddered under the crash of its weight. And then . . . silence.</p>
<p class="size2">I waited and watched. I got to my feet. </p>
<p class="size2">A soft tumble of pebbles sounded just moments before 
the ettin looked over the top of the rock with its four eyes -- its four
 enraged eyes. </p>
<p class="size2">I saw my life pass before me. </p>
<p class="size2"><b>Magic and Muscle</b></p>
<p class="size2">The silhouette of a greatclub eclipsed the sun. The 
weapon came down into my shoulder. I heard bone crack. That hurt. Badly.
 The ettin wasn't done. It had another greatclub that it slammed into my
 head. My ears rang. </p>
<p class="size2">I struggled to focus, drew a pouch from my belt and 
clapped it between my hands. I sent my magical energies to attack the 
ettin. The spell, <i>Melf's acid arrow</i>, caused the ettin to cry out in pain. I had scored a successful attack on him.</p>
<p class="size2">The greatclub rose and came down again, this time smack
 in the middle of my chest. It knocked the breath out of me. I fell 
back. The ettin's second club missed me, though the disturbed air poofed
 the hair at my forehead. </p>
<p class="size2">Holding my ribs, I scrambled to my feet and ran. I ran 
because my life depended upon it. Behind me, those ominous footfalls 
took up a giant's pounding pursuit. I began to think I had taunted my 
last giant, when ahead I noticed a rock formation. In that rock 
formation lay a small cave entrance. I wasn't sure whether I could fit 
through it, but I calculated with certainty that the ettin couldn't. I 
determined to give it a try, knowing that I had little other choice. I 
ducked and weaved, and dodged and bobbed.</p>
<p class="size2">When the cave entrance came within reach, I threw 
myself toward it and shimmied inside. The giant snatched at me, but I 
wriggled out of its grasp just in the nick of time. I barely squeezed 
through that slash in the rock. I crawled to the rear of the cave and 
sheltered in an alcove.</p>
<p class="size2">The ettin poked a longspear through the cave entrance, but it couldn't reach me. </p>
<p class="size2">I sat down to rest, and to wait, until the stupid ettin gave up and went away. I waited three long, unhappy days.</p>
<p class="size2"><b>Monster Tactics</b></p>
<p class="size2">If I were to give you one piece of advice relative to 
battling an ettin, I'd have to say, "Don't do what I did." I made it 
through my encounter with little intact, not even my dignity.</p>
<p class="size2">I did, however, learn a great deal about ettins. You'll
 note, in studying my memoir of the event, that the ettin doesn't have a
 friendly bone in its body. Do not approach the monster thinking you can
 speak to it. Bad adventurer. It will eat your head.</p>
<p class="size2">I also learned that ettins, while they carry on 
conversations with themselves, do not have any trouble getting both 
heads to work together when necessary. If anything, two pairs of eyes 
and ears give it a significant advantage. Don't underestimate them 
simply because they're stupid. Ettins know how to stay alive and protect
 their territory, and they have a healthy dose of moral turpitude 
spicing their methods.</p>
<p class="size2">Further, you'll have much better luck coping with an 
ettin if you stay out of its close range. The ettin I met didn't fight 
nearly as well at longer ranges. I never again, however, want to find 
myself up close and personal with an ettin and his greatclubs. I'm still
 smarting from that pounding. Ettins have long arms, despite their short
 attention spans. So keep your distance and use your long-range attacks,
 if you must engage the giant at all. A spell like <i>levitate</i> would have come in handy.</p>
<p class="size2">I wish my companions had been present to aid me. I've 
given some thought to what I would have done, had they been there. 
First, I would have sent our most agile and swift-footed to keep the 
ettin busy. While she drew the giant's attention, the rest of us could 
have bombarded it with long-range attacks that put none of us at 
unreasonable risk. Those of us who fling magic could have had more of an
 impact than I had in the thick of things. I found myself fighting for 
my life. I would have presented the ettin with a more intimidating 
challenge had I managed to stay away from those double greatclubs.</p>
<p class="size2">I should mention that later, during my cavernous 
incarceration, I discovered that ettins don't always travel alone. This 
one had a gang. You can't imagine how long that last night stretched, 
listening to them argue with each other and with their other heads over 
what I can only presume were their plans for my fate. Be very certain 
that you're prepared before you take on a group of these giants. If 
their gestures were any indication, they play for keeps.</p>
<p class="size2">My last bit of advice to you applies to all situations.
 More important even than the abilities to fight, to take your wounds 
like a warrior, and to cast magic that knocks the proverbial socks off 
your opponents, is the ability to maneuver better in battle than your 
foes. By this, I mean, you want to get out of the way of their attacks. 
Now, I don't recommend fleeing, per se, though sometimes it's better to 
live to fight another day. </p>
<p class="size2">Flying would have worked nicely. I wish I knew that 
spell. I would have lifted into the sky and shot crossbow bolts at that 
ettin. I would have deftly dodged his lame longspears! I would have 
rained a shower of pain upon him!! I would have spit in his four eyes!!!
 I would have. . . .</p>
