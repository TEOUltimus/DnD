        I think of my experience with roleplaying games, the phrase "old 
        campaigner" comes to mind. Ever since I learned how to play <b>Dungeons 
        &amp; Dragons</b> from a friend of mine (using the little brown books 
        some of us remember so fondly and upgrading to the hardbacks as they were 
        originally released), I've thought of nearly every game as long-term. 
        I expected my very first character to survive to high level and become 
        a great hero (he died at 5th level, fighting orcs). As a Dungeon Master, 
        I created worlds from whole cloth, expecting my players to explore every 
        inch of them (on, below, and above the surface) before we'd move on. I 
        ran campaigns that lasted for years and those that lasted only a few weeks 
        -- but the intention was always, "start strong, stay long."</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
        ethic, however, doesn't always lend itself to a campaign that has to revolve 
        around unusual work schedules or crushing deadlines. Not every player 
        who wants to participate in a game can make it every week, and even the 
        DM might fall behind schedule, unable to plan ahead for a night's gaming. 
        Nothing crushes a campaign more readily than having to cancel sessions, 
        for whatever reason. Knowing this, I hesitated before starting a recent 
        campaign.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until 
        I had an <i>idea.</i></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        Background</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several 
        months ago, I got involved in a regular Monday-night <b>D&amp;D</b> campaign. 
        While we did incorporate some playtesting into the game, and most of the 
        players were people I worked with in the Wizards RPG department, the focus 
        was on fun. I didn't even have to DM -- I got to play a monk named Tarian 
        and tumbled around kicking humanoid butt.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We had 
        a lot of fun playing. The group expanded and contracted (as many gaming 
        groups do), with <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/ps/ps20001206a#bio1%20">David 
        Noonan</a> (editor/designer for the <b>D&amp;D</b> team), <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/catalog/product.asp?wtc11840%20">James 
        Wyatt</a> (<b>D&amp;D</b> Worlds designer), Daneen McDermott (then <b>Magic</b> 
        continuity editor), and Tim Rhodes (no Wizards affiliation at all!) forming 
        the nucleus. We foiled bandits, fought dire animals, and suffered through 
        the rain-soaked days and nights of Sumberton for about five levels' worth 
        of play. Some of the things I'd worried about with starting my own campaign 
        (people not being able to show up regularly, games being canceled on short 
        notice, etc.) did happen, but not nearly as often as I'd feared. The core 
        group stuck with the game, and we had fun.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eventually, 
        though, David (the DM) wanted to take a little break. We'd finished the 
        latest campaign storyline and he, I think, wanted to try playing again. 
        Whatever the reason, I had the excuse I'd needed to try out what I thought 
        was an interesting idea.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        One-Shot </b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I suggested 
        that the group allow me to run a one-shot adventure with some campaign 
        elements built in. I told them flat out that I wasn't ready to run a campaign, 
        but that I did want to try a little DMing (my Dungeon Master muscles needed 
        a workout), and that I had an idea that I hoped would interest them. I 
        might run follow-up adventures, but I wanted to stress the idea that this 
        was one game and it would have all the plusses and minuses associated 
        with playing for a single night with one set of characters. They kindly 
        agreed to give it a try.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        Characters</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think 
        one of the reasons the idea was such an easy sell was that I let each 
        of the players construct a 6th-level character with a set amount of magical 
        treasure to be chosen ahead of time by the players themselves. I don't 
        know how many people have tried this, but the new rules for<b> D&amp;D</b> 
        -- particularly those in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide </i>concerning 
        the creation of higher-level PCs -- make this really very easy and attractive. 
        I asked each person to conform to a few minor house rules (such as, "don't 
        spend more than half your gold on any one item") but other than that, 
        I let the players use their imaginations. Being imaginative people, they 
        dug in and came back with an assortment of interesting PCs.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James 
        Wyatt created a cleric of Wee Jas named Sanaril with a rather unique outlook 
        on undead: "They're just misunderstood! They can be our friends!" 
        The rest of the party: "What do you <i>mean</i>, no spontaneous healing?"</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">David 
        Noonan shrugged off the mantle of DM (no, we don't really wear mantles 
        or funny hats when we play -- that's just something that happens on bad 
        sitcoms . . . or on <i>really</i> special occasions) and slid into the 
        role of Kawika the barbarian (with a little bit of rogue sprinkled in). 
        Lots of grunting and gravely rumblings came from that end of the table, 
        and I could tell he'd get into character easily. I just had to get him 
        out of character again before the next day's work.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dexter 
        the halfling came next, played by Daneen McDermott. Dexter looks like 
        a thief, moves like a thief, and even acts like a thief … but he's 
        a wizard. Eschewing spells like <i>fireball</i> and <i>lightning bolt</i>, 
        Dexter gives lessons on how to move around quickly and quietly and how 
        "not to be seen." Yes, cries of, "What? No <i>lighting 
        bolt</i>?" were heard at various times, but a fun character nonetheless.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tim Rhodes 
        tried out the multiclassing rules and played a character whose combination 
        of classes I still hesitate to guess. I know there's some rogue in there, 
        and some cleric, but there's at least one other class poking around and 
        maybe two. I try not to think too hard about him, 'cause it makes my head 
        hurt.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We all 
        got to bend our perceptions of what <b>D&amp;D</b> characters "ought 
        to be." I was pleased to see so many unusual characters because that 
        meant everyone wanted to try something different -- the DM included. We 
        got down to business right away.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A 
        Little Backstory</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
        this was to be a one-shot game, I did want to provide enough background 
        for it to be a roleplaying session and not just a hack-and-slash dungeon 
        crawl. I have nothing against some hacking and slashing (indeed, the bulk 
        of this adventure involved a lot of die-rolling and bloodlust-venting), 
        but I wanted it to satisfy the roleplaying need as well. So here's the 
        background I gave to the players.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each 
        of the characters had ties to a city-state called Forghul. A northern 
        city on the edge of the frontier, Forghul's founders were pirates and 
        raiders, not unlike Earth's own Vikings. Over a few centuries, Forghul's 
        people progressed beyond raiding and pillaging, however, and became more 
        civilized. At the time of our adventure they still prized a strong warrior 
        over a wise loremaster, but they could see some value in both.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governed 
        by ruling clans, the Forghul followed a Great Thane. Great Thanes ruled 
        the Clan Council but not as dictators -- their decisions had to be ratified 
        by the council, but a Great Thane that couldn't get his way wasn't really 
        a Great Thane. It would be most unusual for a Great Thane's wishes to 
        be discarded or ignored.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adventures 
        are about the unusual.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heredity 
        played a great part in the government of Forghul. Leadership in the clans 
        mainly followed the rules of primogenitor. A clan leader could appoint 
        someone else as his or her successor, but usually the firstborn son or 
        daughter of a clan leader became the new leader (and a member of the Thane's 
        Council) upon the parent's death or retirement. The same went for the 
        position of Great Thane, though the Council had to ratify the succession. 
        It would be most unusual for a Great Thane's chosen successor not to achieve 
        ratification on the first vote. Three votes were allowed, and it would 
        be almost unheard-of for a chosen successor to fail to get enough votes 
        by the third try.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adventurers 
        are also about the unheard-of.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Great 
        Thane of Forghul, Aelric, died suddenly. His two eldest children, a son 
        and a daughter, had died fighting frost giants in the northern wars only 
        a few months before. His youngest child, a daughter, was only six years 
        old. But Aelric left one other child -- a son named Malcolm, sometimes 
        called the Dancer. Aelric had indicated that he would like Malcolm to 
        succeed him, but had not officially declared him heir.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
        Malcolm was "away south" at the time of Aelric's sickness and 
        death. Many thought Aelric had sent Malcolm south because he disliked 
        the boy, or thought him weak. In truth, Aelric considered Malcolm the 
        wisest of his children and while he had not considered him as a candidate 
        for Thanedom before Malcolm's older siblings' deaths, he had believed 
        him the best possible ambassador to more civilized lands that Forghul 
        could have. But many of the clan leaders didn't know this, and others 
        saw a chance to increase their own power. They delayed calling for Malcolm 
        until Aelric was already dead, and they buried the Great Thane -- along 
        with his sword of office, traditionally passed along to the heir of the 
        Thaneship -- in the tombs built in the mountains around the city. Many 
        hoped that this would show Malcolm he was not wanted. A few hoped to dispense 
        with the office of Great Thane and leave the rule of Forghul to the unchecked 
        Council.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PCs 
        enter the picture as friends of Malcolm the Dancer -- they have either 
        met and served him, or met and served his allies on the Council. They 
        agreed to venture into the tomb and retrieve the sword in exchange for 
        a large reward.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        Tomb</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
        the help of my wife, Jill, I set up a large diorama to represent the Tomb 
        of the Great Thane. We used Dwarven Forge's MasterMaze terrain set. (If 
        you haven't seen this stuff, check it out. It's all 3D painted dungeon 
        and cavern pieces that you can arrange in a variety of shapes and sizes 
        -- and it's 25mm scale, perfect for miniatures. When players see it all 
        laid out on a table, somebody's going to go, "Ooh, ahh," even 
        if you have a group of die-hard gamers like the ones I was playing with. 
        Anyway, back to the story. . . .) I explained that they were getting to 
        see the dungeon ahead of time because the tomb had been built for the 
        Great Thane by the people of Forghul -- someone among them would have 
        kept a map record. The diorama represented the map.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The preview 
        also helped me with another aspect of the game: When running a one-shot 
        event, it's important to get things moving quickly and keep them moving. 
        Otherwise, the game will likely take longer than you planned and your 
        players won't get to the climax of the adventure when you want them to. 
        Unlike a typical campaign, where you can break and pick up again as needed, 
        a one-shot is just that. You get one chance for fun and if you blow it, 
        you're done.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I figure 
        most games revolve around three unknowns: "Where are we going?", 
        "What are we doing?" and "Why are we going there and doing 
        that?" The backstory I supplied the players (using both handouts 
        and roleplaying) and the revealed map covered the first and last questions. 
        The adventure would be about the second. "What are we doing?" 
        expanded to "What challenges will we face?", "How will 
        we survive?", etc. We looked forward to answering those questions.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The answers 
        actually came in a hurry. Rather than encountering what you would expect 
        in a tomb (nasty undead, vicious traps, and a sprinkling of underground 
        monsters), the PCs ran into mystic puzzles and challenges that represented 
        trials the Great Thane had overcome himself on his way to becoming a hero 
        of Forghul. When the PCs entered a room, they saw their surroundings change 
        and their assumptions challenged while they struggled to survive.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
        I won't go into too much detail (this story is, if you hadn't noticed, 
        about the game play <i>experience</i> rather than the game itself), I 
        will say this approach allowed me to work in sharks, frost elementals, 
        shocker lizards, and other unexpected surprises for the PCs to face. Watching 
        a dungeoneering party deal with the sudden lack of dungeon surrounding 
        them was rather interesting. Seeing how cleverly they overcame each obstacle 
        was even more rewarding.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        Campaign Begins . . .</b></font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only 
        one player character died (Kawika, and he came back to complete the adventure 
        as a ghost) and the party did reach Aelric's resting place, where they 
        found the Great Thane's shade imprisoned by foul magic. After talking 
        to him they became convinced that someone on the Thane's Council (or someone 
        hoping to influence it) had killed him and was working to keep Malcolm 
        off the throne. Aelric agreed to give the PCs his sword of office, but 
        only if they'd perform a few tasks for him (for which they would be rewarded). 
        The night ended with them receiving some reward (Kawika given a semblance 
        of life and each of them gaining some magical treasure) and being told 
        what they could do to complete their quest.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this 
        point, we had two options. The group had gotten a chance to play some 
        unusual characters and I'd had my chance to run an unusual game. We could 
        return to other gaming the following week, using a more traditional campaign 
        basis, but I had left the door open for more adventuring. The Great Thane 
        could transport any or all of them to various places to complete quests 
        for him (and for them), and he could reward them out of his and his ancestors' 
        treasure hoard. Either way, the one-shot was a success.</font></p>
      <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
        the players rewarded me with enthusiasm for the game. Even though I'd 
        set up Forghul and the Thane's Quest as only a one-shot, with a few possible 
        "to be continued" elements, the players wanted more. They went 
        on to complete several quests for the Great Thane and ended up gaining 
        the sword of Forghul. They restored Kawika to full life (a mixed blessing—I 
        think David liked playing a ghost) and they had adventures and gained 
        renown throughout the land. They even gained a few more comrades . . . 
        but that's a separate story. The "Campaign Kick-Off" worked, 
        and it kicked me back into the DM's chair. Now I just have to follow it 
        up with something. . . .</font></p>
