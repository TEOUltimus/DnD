<p align="LEFT">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes. Check out this column every month for a new batch of 
formidable enemies built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>The Scorpion: A Toxic Challenge</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2007-09%20-%20Scorpions_files/eo_scorpion_sm.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="237" width="283">This
 month, our base creature is the monstrous scorpion -- a terrifying 
version of the traditional desert-dwelling vermin. A monstrous scorpion 
ranges in length from 18 inches to more than 60 feet, and thanks to its 
Constitution-damaging poison, it is quite capable of sending adventurers
 of all kinds to their doom. In fact, a single sting from a Gargantuan 
or Colossal monstrous scorpion can easily kill a character, particularly
 one already injured by its other attacks.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A monstrous scorpion is likely to attack any creature 
that approaches it, and it usually couples such an attack with a charge.
 As a nonintelligent creature, it has no capacity to learn or adapt to 
changing situations, so it must rely on its claws and sting to defeat 
its victims. Those rare monstrous scorpions that gain intelligence from a
 template or other effect need not adhere to these restrictions.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The four monstrous scorpion variants presented in this 
article range from CR 2 to CR 9. The first two incorporate relatively 
simple changes to the basic monstrous scorpion and thus can easily be 
inserted into any campaign, either individually or in numbers. The third
 variant makes a good NPC opponent for mid-level PCs, and in numbers it 
could challenge characters of up to 10th level. The fourth version is 
best used as a unique encounter.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2007-09%20-%20Scorpions_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Shadow Scorpion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Shadow scorpions lurk in ruined desert temples, hidden 
caves, and other dark places, and occasionally some master villain 
brings a few to other locations to serve as guardians. These creatures 
use their speed and shadow blend ability to approach prey unseen, 
grappling with their claws and striking victims with their deadly poison
 stingers. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A typical shadow scorpion looks like a pure black 
scorpion with silver eyes and claw tips. Though its CR is only 2, a 
colony of 2-5 shadow scorpions has an Encounter Level between 4 and 7, 
so it can give even mid-level characters a scary surprise.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shadow Monstrous Scorpion:</b> CR 2; Medium magical

<p align="LEFT"><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A shadow scorpion deals 1d4+1 points of damage on a successful grapple check.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d3 Con, secondary damage 1d3 Con.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Shadow Blend (Su):</b> In any conditions other than 
full daylight, a shadow scorpion can disappear into the shadows, giving 
it total concealment. Artificial illumination -- even a <i>light</i> or <i>continual flame</i> spell -- does not negate this ability. A <i>daylight</i> spell, however, will.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2007-09%20-%20Scorpions_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Fire Scorpion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Fire scorpions hail from the Elemental Plane of Fire. As
 desert denizens, scorpions have a natural affinity for heat, so this 
combination is a natural one. </p>
<p align="LEFT">A fire scorpion has a deep red carapace and orange 
claws. Its natural heat makes its constricting attack all the more 
dangerous, and victims that cannot escape quickly may literally burn to 
death. Fire laces the creature's poison as well, and victims of its 
sting often feel as though their bodies are burning up from the inside.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fire Monstrous Scorpion:</b> CR 4; Large elemental

<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Climb +8, Hide +0, Jump +12, Spot +4.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Burn (Ex):</b> Any creature hit by the natural 
weapons of a fire scorpion must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex save or catch 
fire. The fire burns for 1d4 rounds (see Catching on Fire in <i>the Dungeon Master's Guide</i>). A grappled character who is on fire can't put himself out until after he escapes the grapple.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> A fire scorpion deals 1d6+4 points of damage on a successful grapple check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Heat (Ex):</b> A fire scorpion deals 1d4 points of additional fire damage with its natural weapons.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a fire scorpion must hit with a claw attack. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d4 Con, secondary damage 1d4 Con.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Elemental Traits:</b> A fire scorpion has immunity to
 poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. It is not subject to 
critical hits or flanking. It cannot be raised, reincarnated or 
resurrected (though a <i>limited wish, wish, miracle, </i>or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore life). </p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Elite Tauric Drow/Scorpion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">In the traditional settings of the <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</b> game, the drow are closely associated with spiders. The <b>Eberron</b> campaign setting, however, associates dark elves with scorpions instead. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The tauric drow/scorpion presented below makes an 
excellent temple guard or elite killer, and it can easily be advanced in
 power by adding more class levels. If you're not using the <b>Eberron</b>
 setting, this NPC can be a rogue outcast from the drow without the 
religious symbolism of the drider, or perhaps even part of a growing 
splinter cult within the drow kingdom. </p>
<p align="LEFT">This tauric drow/scorpion was built from a Large 
monstrous scorpion advanced to 8 HD and a drow with two fighter levels. 
The tauric template appears in <i>Savage Species</i> and in <i>Monster Manual II, </i>but
 two modifications to the template have been applied here. First, the 
creature has the good and poor base saving throws of the base creature, 
calculated for the number of monstrous humanoid Hit Dice it possesses. 
Second, it keeps the racial skill bonuses for both the base creature and
 the base humanoid.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Drow/Scorpion Fighter:</b> Male tauric drow/scorpion

<p align="LEFT"><b>Locate Secret Doors:</b> The tauric drow/scorpion is 
entitled to a Search check when within 5 feet of a secret or concealed 
door as though actively looking for it.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Light Blindness:</b> Abrupt exposure to bright light 
blinds the tauric drow/scorpion for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, it is
 dazzled as long as it remains in the affected area.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Possessions:</b><i>+1 composite longbow</i> (+6 Str bonus), 10 arrows, 10 adamantine arrows, <i>bracers of armor +3, ring of protection +1,</i> gold scorpion medallion (1,000 gp), 25 pp.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Chimeric Scorpion</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Long ago, an unknown wizard used foul magics to combine 
two of the desert's deadliest denizens -- the blue dragon and the Huge 
monstrous scorpion. Sadly, this chimeric scorpion's offspring have 
spread to the point that they can now be found in warm deserts 
everywhere. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The chimeric scorpion makes a terrifying foe and has a 
variety of powerful attacks at its disposal. Since it retains the 
scorpion's mindless nature, however, it is incapable of employing any 
strategy or tactics.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Chimeric Monstrous Scorpion:</b> CR 9; Huge magical 
beast (augmented vermin); HD 10d10+50; hp 105; Init +0; Spd 50 ft., fly
