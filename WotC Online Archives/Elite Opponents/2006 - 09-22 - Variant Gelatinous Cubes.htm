<p align="left">Welcome to <i>Creature Incarnations,</i> a column all about monsters -- and strange, variant monsters at that! The <i><b>D&amp;D</b> Fight Club</i>
 column presents one monster at three different power levels, so that 
you can insert the appropriate version into your campaign. This column, 
on the other hand, examines different versions of a given creature for 
use in different types of campaigns. Though most versions fit best into <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns, one version in this installment is for the <b>d20 Modern</b> game, so you can use the creature in your modern-day or future campaigns too.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Design Notes</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-22%20-%20Variant%20Gelatinous%20Cubes_files/dx0922eoci_cube.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="183" width="240">Welcome
 back! Today we embark on a journey into the depths of the dungeon to 
meet some of the strangest monsters known -- gelatinous cubes.</p>
<p align="left">The gelatinous cube doesn't see (no pun intended) many 
adventurers beyond 3rd or 4th level because it is traditionally a wimpy 
monster. All you have to do is avoid it, and it doesn't really bother 
you. Traditionally, gelatinous cubes are just lonely dungeon cleaners 
whose function is to reset the dungeon by eating the bodies (both 
character and monster) that adventuring parties leave behind.</p>
<p align="left">Some of the better trap designers, however, have made 
ingenious use of these creatures. My personal favorite is the pit filled
 with a gelatinous cube, with a sliding door that closes over it as soon
 as someone falls in. If you don't have friends, you aren't getting out 
of that trap without magic. Another good trap drops the cube from above,
 so that it automatically engulfs the character who set it off. </p>
<p align="left">The three gelatinous cubes I've presented here are not 
necessarily for higher party levels. In truth, modifying a gelatinous 
cube to reach or exceed CR 10 can be a difficult trick. One of this set 
-- the monk cube -- is relatively powerful, but be sure that it uses all
 its abilities to evade damage, slow falls, or deflect arrows in front 
of the PCs, or they won't get the full effect. The rest of the cubes 
here are pretty strange, but still suitable for lower-level groups.</p>
<p align="left">Let's admit it. As far as monsters go, gelatinous cubes 
can be pretty amusing. Every one of these versions has some humorous 
element to it -- so enjoy!</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2006%20-%2009-22%20-%20Variant%20Gelatinous%20Cubes_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>d20 Modern: Lab Experiment Gone Awry</b></p>
<p align="left">The mysterious aliens called fraal (also known as grays)
 have been meddling with life on Earth for millennia. They are primarily
 interested in humans, but they also like to study how visits by other 
species have affected human development through the centuries. One 
aspect of their research involves taking specimens of living beings and 
performing experiments on them to determine which creatures are 
compatible with fraal genes. Occasionally, they even find a species that
 could be improved by such an addition. Over the centuries, they have 
examined just about every creature that humans have ever encountered.</p>
<p align="left">As a result of their genetic experiments, this odd 
creature -- a half-fraal/half-gelatinous cube -- resides in a lab hidden
 somewhere on Earth. The fraal were fascinated by the cube's totally 
alien form and its lack of complex physiology. So they collected a few 
of the creatures and took them back to their city-ships, where they 
proceeded to poke and prod them -- a process that the cubes hardly 
seemed to notice -- and take tissue samples. Eventually, they managed to
 isolate the cube's genetic code and began splicing its genes with their
 own, as well as the genes of humans and other life forms. Most of their
 experiments died, but this one survived. The fraal genes didn't change 
the creature's appearance much, though it looks grayer and slightly less
 transparent than a normal gelatinous cube. However, the cube did grow 
much bigger than a normal specimen, and eventually it started consuming 
the fraal's laboratories.</p>
<p align="left">The fraal deposited it back on Earth in a secret 
laboratory that they no longer used and surrounded the place with metal 
and stone. Unless it gets out, it will be waiting there when a band of 
intrepid heroes eventually finds it. The fraal did arrange for it to be 
fed periodically, so it is not exactly suffering, but it is hungry.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">This creature's psionics provide it with a significant advantage. It uses <i>suggestion</i> primarily to get its victims to stand still while it engulfs them.</p>

 Acid (Ex) The cube's body produces a corrosive substance. Any creature 
that strikes or touches the cube with its body, or that grapples it, 
automatically takes 1d6 points of acid damage. A creature takes damage 
from this ability only once per turn. This cube's acid does not harm 
metal or stone.</p>
<p align="left"> Engulf (Ex) Although it moves slowly, this cube can 
simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It 
cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it engulfs. The cube 
merely moves over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. 
Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the cube, but any 
creature that does so is not entitled to a saving throw. A creature that
 does not attempt an attack of opportunity must succeed on a DC 24 
Reflex save or be engulfed. On a success, it is pushed back or aside 
(opponent's choice) as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are 
subject to the cube's paralysis and acid and are considered to be 
grappled and trapped within its body. The save DC is Strength-based and 
includes a +1 racial bonus.</p>
<p align="left"> Paralysis (Ex) Anyone hit by the 
half-fraal/half-gelatinous cube's slam or engulf attack must succeed on a
 DC 29 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can 
automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"> Transparent (Ex) A half-fraal/half-gelatinous cube is 
hard to see, even under ideal conditions, but not as hard to see as an 
unmodified gelatinous cube. It takes a DC 13 Spot check to notice one.

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Alien Gelatinous Cube</b></p>
<p align="left">This creature is not all that different from the 
standard gelatinous cube, even though it has an inherited template. But a
 gelatinous cube with tentacles is still kind of freaky, don't you 
think? The pseudonatural template creates a similar creature, though 
that one has an Intelligence score, just as the next entry does.</p>
<p align="left">A half-farspawn (see <i>Lords of Madness</i>) results 
when a being from the Far Realm comes to the known planes and mates with
 a native creature. The creatures of the Far Realm are barely 
imaginable, and their offspring are only slightly more believable. 
Certain creatures, such as cloakers and chuuls, were once native to the 
Far Realm but came to Material Plane long ago and took up permanent 
residence here. Beyond the Far Realm are beings so inconceivable that 
they cannot be brought into existence in the known planes at all. Thus, 
this gelatinous cube is about as alien as it can get.</p>

 Acid (Ex) The half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube's body produces a 
corrosive substance. Any creature that strikes or touches the cube with 
its body, or that grapples it, automatically takes 1d6 points of acid 
damage. A creature takes damage from this ability only once per turn. 
This cube's acid does not harm metal or stone.</p>
<p align="left"> Change Shape (Su) A half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube 
can assume the form of a grotesque, tentacled mass. as a standard 
action. This ability functions as a polymorph spell cast on itself as a 
4th-level caster, except a half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube does not 
regain hit points for changing form, and its movement modes do not 
change. Furthermore, it retains the tentacle attacks granted by this 
template and gains two additional tentacle attacks when using a full 
attack action. In addition, any creature native to the Material Plane 
takes a -1 morale penalty on attacks against it. A 
half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube remains in one form until it chooses 
to assume a new one. The cube reverts to its natural form when killed. A
 true seeing spell reveals its natural form.</p>
<p align="left"> Engulf (Ex) Although it moves slowly, a 
half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube can simply mow down Large or smaller 
creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a 
round in which it engulfs. The cube merely moves over the opponents, 
affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of 
opportunity against the cube, but any creature that does so is not 
entitled to a saving throw. A creature that does not attempt an attack 
of opportunity must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be engulfed. On a 
success, it is pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the cube 
moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube's paralysis 
and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body.
 The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p>
<p align="left"> Paralysis (Ex) Anyone hit by a 
half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube's slam or engulf attack must succeed 
on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can 
automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save DC is 
Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"> Transparent (Ex) Half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cubes 
are hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it takes a DC 15 Spot 
check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice the cube and walk into
 it are automatically engulfed.</p>
<p align="left"> True Strike (Su) Once per day, the 
half-farspawn/half-gelatinous cube can make a normal attack with a +20 
insight bonus on a single attack roll. It ignores the miss chance that 
applies to concealed targets.<br><img src="2006%20-%2009-22%20-%20Variant%20Gelatinous%20Cubes_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="300"><br> Hook "The ooze over there with the tentacles looks weird, like some cubic displacer beast. It can't be real, can it?"</p>

 highly improbable creature is the result of taking the rules to the 
very limit. Giving an ooze class levels is usually impossible because 
these creatures don't have Intelligence scores. However, the fiendish 
template provides this cube with a 3 Intelligence, and off we go. </p>
<p align="left">Monk levels seem to fit very well with the gelatinous 
cube's other abilities, and the monk class gives the creature some 
really humorous powers, such as deflecting arrows. Barbarian or fighter 
levels would work too, but a gelatinous cube is limited in its use of 
feats became of its generally low attribute scores. </p>
<p align="left">The real question with this creature is where it could 
learn any monk skills. Ooze monasteries aren't exactly plentiful, after 
all. It must have studied on its own, just like Miyamoto Musashi did.</p>
<p align="left">This cube looks like its brethren, except that it has a 
slight red tinge. It doesn't fly, but it sure moves quickly compared to 
normal gelatinous cubes. It should provide quite a surprise to 
adventuring parties, though perhaps it's not as much of a challenge as 
its CR would indicate. Its AC is still only 6, after all.<br></p>

over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can 
make attacks of opportunity against the cube, but any creature that does
 so is not entitled to a saving throw. A creature that does not attempt 
an attack of opportunity must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or be 
engulfed. On a success, it is pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) 
as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube's 
paralysis and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within
 its body. The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.</p>
<p align="left"> Paralysis (Ex) Anyone hit by the cube's slam or engulf 
attack must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 
rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. The save
 DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"> Transparent (Ex) Fiendish gelatinous cubes are hard to

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Bonus: Amphibious Gelatinous Cube</b></p>
<p align="left">This month you get an extra cube, because everyone can 
use extra gelatinous cubes. If this little gift doesn't reflect what I 
think (or should think) about you, you can always set Meepo on it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Warning: </b>This creature breaks the rules. There, 
you've been told. The amphibious template cannot be added to any 
creature other than humanoids and monstrous humanoids. And in most 
cases, that restriction makes sense. After all, you don't want a 
water-breathing dog -- such a creature would really do poorly living 
underwater, dog-paddling at a speed of only 5 feet. And most other 
creatures that you might put underwater don't need to breathe, or 
already have an aquatic variant somewhere in the rules, or can survive 
underwater with some magical aid. However, now and then it makes perfect
 sense for some creature other than the usual humanoid and monstrous 
humanoid types to live underwater in its own state.</p>
<p align="left">An amphibious gelatinous cube looks sort of like an 
immense jellyfish, floating slowly through the water and eating whatever
 comes within range. This cube can live at 400 feet below sea level or 
float serenely on the surface waiting for small boats to come along. 
(Boats are like nuts; the shell is tough, but the inside is usually good
 to eat.) And since it's transparent, this cube is quite difficult to 
see in the water.</p>

 Acid (Ex) The amphibious gelatinous cube's body produces a corrosive 
substance. Any creature that strikes or touches the cube with its body, 
or that grapples it, automatically takes 1d6 points of acid damage. A 
creature takes damage from this ability only once per turn. This cube's 
acid does not harm metal or stone.</p>
<p align="left"> Amphibious (Ex) An amphibious gelatinous cube can breathe air and water equally well.</p>
<p align="left"> Engulf (Ex) Although it moves slowly, the amphibious 
gelatinous cube can simply mow down Large or smaller creatures as a 
standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round in which it
 engulfs. The cube merely moves over the opponents, affecting as many as
 it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against the 
cube, but any creature that does so is not entitled to a saving throw. A
 creature that does not attempt an attack of opportunity must succeed on
 a DC 13 Reflex save or be engulfed. On a success, it is pushed back or

are subject to the cube's paralysis and acid, and are considered to be

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Additional Feats</b></p>
<p align="left">The following feats are from sources other than the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Toughness (from <i>Complete Warrior</i>):</b>
 You gain a number of hit points equal to your current Hit Dice. Each 
time you gain a Hit Die (such as by gaining a level), you gain 1 
additional hit point. If you lose a Hit Die (such as by losing a level),
 you lose 1 hit point permanently.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Inured to Energy (from <i>Savage Species</i>): </b>Your
 existing resistance to one type of energy increases by 10. You can use 
this feat only to enhance existing resistances, not to gain resistance 
to a new type of energy. For example, a demon can increase its 
resistance to acid, cold, or fire, but it cannot gain sonic resistance 
with this feat. You can gain this feat multiple times, and its effects 
stack. Each time you take the feat, you can either apply it to another 
type of energy to which you already have resistance, or increase an 
existing resistance.</p>
