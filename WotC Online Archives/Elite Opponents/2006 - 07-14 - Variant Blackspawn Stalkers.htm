 came out recently, and it has some interesting new creatures. Chief 
among these are the spawn of Tiamat, evil creatures that are either 
monstrous humanoids or magical beasts but imbued with some of Tiamat's 
own power. Thus, they combine some draconic aspect with another type of 
creature. The spawn of Tiamat have spread throughout the planes and bred
 on their own, and so variants are bound to appear as the creatures 
undertake transformations, become undead, or are forced into becoming 
the subjects of magical experimentation.</p>
<p align="LEFT">One type of spawn of Tiamat is the blackspawn stalker, a
 large creature that looks like a cross between a spider and a black 
dragon, and variants on this theme are what this month's column is all 
about. As magical beasts, they can work with a very large number of 
templates. Of course, a chimeric one of these creatures would be way 
cool, but unfortunately that template is not applicable. I trust you'll 
be inspired enough by the selection that we did find (via Rent-a-Scout) 
that you will explore your own variants for your game.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2007-14%20-%20Variant%20Blackspawn%20Stalkers_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b> d20 Modern: Half-Fiend Spawn of Tiamat</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Given that the spawn of Tiamat have some of her essence 
and evil power within them, they already have a fiendish nature without 
the specific template. If they are great servants as they are, how much 
better are they when you breed them with fiends? Having a fiend as a 
parent infuses the spawn with even more evil, and since Tiamat lives in 
Hell anyway she is used to dealing with fiends. The blackspawn stalker 
here has been modified with the half-fiend template from the <i>d20 Menace Manual</i>.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A half-fiend blackspawn stalker has more tones of black 
than blue or gray in its hide, and it possesses large batlike wings on 
its back that are covered in fine scales. Overall, the creature's body 
is scalier than one normally sees in a blackspawn stalker. Its fiendish 
blood lends its visage more hideousness than that of its less fiendish 
cousin, and its cruel streak is stronger.</p>

 A half-fiend blackspawn stalker typically begins a battle by charging 
at an opponent. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a 
charge, this allows the half-fiend blackspawn stalker to make a single 
gore attack with a +15 attack bonus that deals 4d6+9 points of damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spit Acid (Su)</b> A half-fiend blackspawn stalker 
can spit its acidic saliva up to 60 feet as a standard action. This is a
 ranged touch attack with no range increment that deals 5d6 points of 
acid damage. This acid damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 additional 
HD.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tiamat's Blessing (Acid) (Su)</b> All spawn of Tiamat within 5 feet of a half-fiend blackspawn stalker gain immunity to acid.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Web (Ex)</b> A half-fiend blackspawn stalker can 
throw two webs per round, up to eight times per day. Each of these 
attacks is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against 
targets up to Huge size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing 
no movement. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if 
the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling 
free. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 21 Escape Artist check 
or burst it with a DC 21 Strength check. The check DCs are 
Constitution-based. The web has 12 hit points, hardness 0, and takes 
double damage from fire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A half-fiend blackspawn stalker can create sheets of 
sticky webbing up to 20 feet square. It usually positions these sheets 
to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. 
Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a 
web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a 
successful web attack. Each 5-foot section of webbing has 12 hit points 
and damage reduction 5/--. A half-fiend blackspawn stalker can move 
across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact 
location of any creature touching the web.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Stony Woodling Blackspawn Stalker</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature comes from using two templates that 
probably should not work together, but according to the rules they do. 
The woodling template from <i>Monster Manual III</i> grants a creature plant traits and a plantlike exterior without changing its type. The mineral warrior template in <i>Underdark</i>
 is an acquired template that creates creatures made of living stone. 
They get that way because of experimentation by wizards, but then can 
breed true. The origin of this creature is a mystery, but probably 
someone created woodling blackspawn stalkers to attack woody 
communities, and some drow sorcerer got his hands on one of them and 
modified it forcefully for use in the Underdark. Since the blackspawn 
stalker is part spider, some drow think they are servants of Lolth sent 
to aid them against the surface world.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A stony woodling blackspawn stalker looks like a 
blackspawn stalker with woody skin and brushy hair, except that the 
woody skin has a stony look to it, like petrified wood. It otherwise 
acts the same as a standard blackspawn stalker, setting traps with its 
webs and charging foes to make its deadly charge attack. It relies on 
its nearly impenetrable skin to protect it from the dangers of charging.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Spiderswarm Blackspawn Stalker</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Taking the spidery theme of the blackspawn stalker to an
 extreme results in this strange creature. The swarm-shifter template is
 presented in <i>Libris Mortis</i> and is quite fun for making a surprising creature with little CR cost. Just picture Imhotep from <i>The Mummy</i>
 turning into a cloud of dust and you'll get a good idea. If only he had
 turned into a swarm of scarab beetles. . . . To use the swarm-shifter 
template, the creature has to be undead. Making a magical beast undead 
is not that easy, but the mumia template from <i>Ghostwalk</i> comes to 
the rescue. Undoubtedly some splinter group devoted to Nerull or Lolth 
or even Tiamat made a blackspawn stalker into a mumia so it could 
continue the fight, and the patron deity gave it swarm powers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature looks like a cross between a dessicated 
black dragon and a spider wrapped in leather and strips of cloth. 
Whenever it wants to, it sort of dissolves into a pile of undead spiders
 that scurry creepily along the ground.</p>

 A s blackspawn stalker mumia swarm-shifter typically begins a battle by
 charging at an opponent. In addition to the normal benefits and hazards
 of a charge, this allows the stony woodling blackspawn stalker to make a
 single gore attack with a +15 attack bonus that deals 4d6+9 points of 
damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Distraction (Ex) </b>Fortitude DC 15, nauseated 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Hive Mind (Ex)</b> All blackspawn stalker mumia 
swarm-shifters within 2 miles of each other are in constant 
communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If 
one in a group is not flat-footed, none of them are. No blackspawn 
stalker mumia swarm-shifter in a group is considered flanked unless all 
of them are.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Poison (Ex)</b> Swarm attack, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d3 Str.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spit Acid (Su)</b> A blackspawn stalker mumia 
swarm-shifter can spit its acidic saliva up to 60 feet as a standard 
action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment that deals
 5d6 points of acid damage. This acid damage increases by 1d6 for every 2
 additional HD.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Swarm Form (Su)</b> A blackspawn stalker mumia 
swarm-shifter in normal form can assume the form of a swarm of 
Diminutive undead spiders at will. Changing shape to or from swarm form 
is a standard action that infuses the undead with negative energy and 
heals 10 hit points of damage. The undead cannot change from swarm form 
to its normal form in an area where its body could not normally fit. 
When it would normally be dispersed due to damage taken, the swarm 
reverts to the base creature's form and is destroyed (except in the case
 of undead with special destruction rules). Although the use of this 
ability is a supernatural effect, remaining in one form or another is 
not supernatural, and the base creature in swarm form does not change 
into its normal shape in an <i>antimagic field</i>. <i>True seeing</i> and similar magic reveals both forms.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Tiamat's Blessing (Acid) (Su)</b> All spawn of Tiamat within 5 feet of a blackspawn stalker mumia swarm-shifter gain immunity to acid.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Web (Ex)</b> A blackspawn stalker mumia swarm-shifter
 can throw two webs per round, up to eight times per day. Each of these 
attacks is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50
 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against 
targets up to Huge size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing 
no movement. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if 
the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling 
free. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 22 Escape Artist check 
or burst it with a DC 22 Strength check. The check DCs are 
Constitution-based. The web has 12 hit points, hardness 0, and takes 
double damage from fire.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A blackspawn stalker mumia swarm-shifter can create 
sheets of sticky webbing up to 20 feet square. It usually positions 
these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on 
the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to 
notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as 
though by a successful web attack. Each 5-foot section of webbing has 12
 hit points and damage reduction 5/--. A blackspawn stalker mumia 
swarm-shifter can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and 
can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Withering Touch (Su)</b> A creature hit by one of a 
blackspawn stalker mumia's natural attack (in normal form) must attempt a
 Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 2 points of Constitution as the attacker
 absorbs moisture and energy from its target.</p>
