<p align="left">Welcome to <i>Elite Opponents: Creature Incarnations, </i>a column all about monsters -- and strange, variant monsters at that!<i></i>The <b>D&amp;D</b><i>Fight Club</i>
 column presents one monster at three different power levels, so that 
you can insert the appropriate version into your campaign. This column, 
on the other hand, examines different versions of a given creature for 
use in different types of campaigns. Though most versions fit best into <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns, one version in this installment is for the <b>d20 Modern</b> game, so you can use the creature in your modern-day or future campaigns too.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-09%20-%20The%20Tarrasque_files/dx1109eo_elite_tarrasque.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="354" width="250">This installment begins by looking at the biggest (and some say the baddest) creature in the whole <b>D&amp;D</b>
 game -- the tarrasque. While other monsters may have higher challenge 
ratings, none is as difficult to kill as the tarrasque. But, you may 
wonder, if the tarrasque is unique, how can any variants exist? Well, 
it's true that only one tarrasque exists -- one in the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting,</i> one in the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting,</i>
 one in the World of Greyhawk, and one in your campaign world. Thus, the
 one in your campaign may well be different than the standard version, 
especially if you have an unusual campaign world.</p>
<p align="left">So this month, we consider some variant tarrasques -- 
one of which you might find interesting enough to place in your campaign
 world. Actually trying to kill the tarrasque constitutes an epic 
adventure (or series of adventures), but legends of this creature 
permeate the world, and your NPCs should know something about the 
tarrasque even if they have never seen it.</p>
<p class="size4" align="left"><b>Variant Tarrasques</b></p>
<p align="left">Each of the following tarrasques is 70 feet long and 50 
feet tall, and it weighs about 130 tons, just like the standard one. 
None of the templates used here increase its size, and indeed, the 
tarrasque doesn't need to be any bigger to pack a mean punch.</p>
<p align="left">You might wonder how the tarrasque got an inherited 
template when only one has ever existed, and it never dies. Well, who 
says it never dies? No one has ever seen it reproduce, but perhaps it 
goes dormant and reproduces asexually -- maybe even dying and being 
reborn anew, like the legendary phoenix. In fact, the hollowed-out body 
of a long-dead tarrasque could be an interesting adventure site in its 
own right. But I'll leave the design of that location to you.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-09%20-%20The%20Tarrasque_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Tarrasque of Legend (d20 Modern Game)</b></p>
<p align="left">I'd like to call this version Godzilla, but any breath 
weapon it could have according to the rules is pretty short-range 
compared to the 100-foot radioactive fire breath that the monster used 
in the movies. But when the tarrasque of legend is standing over Tokyo, 
I'll bet your players won't quibble much about the length of its breath 
weapon. </p>
<p align="left">Assigning the monster of legend template from <i>Monster Manual II</i>
 to a unique and legendary creature may seem strange to you -- 
especially since the template says that the creature has special powers 
because it was selected by the gods, and the <b>d20 Modern</b> game doesn't have gods in the same way that <b>D&amp;D</b>
 does. If you can get past the logistics, however, you'll find that this
 template still produces an interesting variant with a little extra 
punch.</p>

Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Enlarge Breath, Great Cleave, Improved 
Bull Rush, Improved InitiativeB, Iron Will, MultiattackB, Power Attack, 
Toughness (6).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Augmented Critical (Ex): </b>The tarrasque of 
legend's bite threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 18-20
 and deals triple damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Every 1d4+1 rounds, the 
tarrasque of legend can breathe a 22-foot-long cone of fire that deals 
3d6 points of fire damage. A successful DC 51 Reflex save halves the 
damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Carapace (Ex):</b> The tarrasque's armorlike carapace is so tough and reflective that it can deflect all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i>
 spells. Any such effect has a 30% chance of reflecting back at the 
caster; otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before 
rolling to overcome the creature's spell resistance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> The tarrasque can 
inspire terror by charging or attacking. Each affected creature must 
succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, and that condition lasts 
as long as it remains within 60 feet of the tarrasque. The save DC is 
Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Greater Damage (Ex):</b> The damage dice for each of the tarrasque of legend's natural attacks increase by one die type.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Haste (Su):</b> The tarrasque of legend always acts as if affected by a <i>haste</i> spell (+1 bonus to AC and on attack rolls, +20 feet of movement, and one extra attack during a full attack sequence).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the 
tarrasque of legend must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite 
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it 
establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> No form of attack deals lethal damage to the tarrasque of legend. It regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i>
 spell or a death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a 
spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned 
above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the 
creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 1,098 hp). The tarrasque of 
legend is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, 
such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay 
golem's cursed wound ability. The tarrasque of legend can be slain only 
by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 
(or 1,098 hit points) and using a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to keep it dead.</p>
<p align="left">If the tarrasque of legend loses a limb or body part, 
the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes. (The detached piece dies and 
decays normally.) The creature can reattach the severed member instantly
 by holding it to the stump.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rush (Ex):</b> Once per minute, the tarrasque of legend can move at a speed of 180 feet. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> The tarrasque of legend can 
try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a 
successful grapple check. Once inside the tarrasque, the opponent takes 
2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per 
round from the creature's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut
 its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque's digestive
 tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the 
hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque
 of legend's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 
512 Tiny or smaller creatures. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills:</b> The tarrasque of legend has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="2005%20-%2011-09%20-%20The%20Tarrasque_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Five-Headed Pyrotarrasque (D&amp;D Game)</b></p>
<p align="left">Imagine a tarrasque with five heads! Not only would it 
have five times the biting power, but it could also bring five fiery 
breath weapons to bear on its opponents! I first tinkered with a 
thirty-headed version (which the template does allow), but such a 
creature is really too nasty for its challenge rating, so I don't 
recommend you make one. Five heads are plenty.</p>
<p align="left">The five-headed pyrotarrasque uses the multiheaded template (pyro version) from <i>Savage Species.</i>
 The end product fits especially well into a campaign world based on 
Greek mythology, or any one in which hydras are common. It's also 
logical for a campaign in which wizards frequently create monstrous 
abominations and leave dangerous magic substances lying around in the 
woods.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Every 1d4 rounds, each of the
 five-headed pyrotarrasque's heads can breathe a jet of fire 10 feet 
high, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet long that deals 3d6 points of fire 
damage. All heads breathe on the same round. A successful DC 28 Reflex 
save halves the damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Carapace (Ex):</b> The five-headed pyrotarrasque's

<p align="left"><b>Multiheaded (Ex):</b> Cutting off one of the 
five-headed pyrotarrasque's heads does not kill it; all heads must be 
severed to disable it. The five-headed pyrotarrasque functions normally 
as long as at least one head remains.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> No form of attack deals lethal
 damage to the five-headed pyrotarrasque. It regenerates even if it 
fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or a death

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spellwarped Woodling Tarrasque (D&amp;D Game)</b></p>
<p align="left">Our last tarrasque uses the spellwarped and woodling templates from <i>Monster Manual III.</i>
 This version is ideally suited for a forested world, since it is 
actually part plant. Because of its plantlike nature and appearance, 
this tarrasque could live deep in the woods, perhaps resembling an 
ancient tree when dormant. Treants and similar intelligent plant 
creatures within the forest might even consider it a godlike being. The 
spellwarped template indicates that it probably lives near some sinkhole
 of magic, such as a nexus, or any similar concentration of magical 
energy in your campaign world.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Augmented Critical (Ex): </b>The spellwarped woodling
 tarrasque's bite threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 
18-20 and deals triple damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Carapace (Ex):</b> The spellwarped woodling 
tarrasque's armorlike carapace is so tough and reflective that it can 
deflect all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i> spells. 
Any such effect has a 30% chance of reflecting back at the caster; 
otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before rolling to 
overcome the creature's spell resistance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Su):</b> The spellwarped woodling
 tarrasque can inspire terror by charging or attacking. Each affected 
creature must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or become shaken, and that 
condition lasts as long as it remains within 60 feet of the tarrasque. 
The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the 
spellwarped woodling tarrasque must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with 
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
 without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple 
check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the 
following round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Plant Traits:</b> The spellwarped woodling tarrasque 
is immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. It is 
not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature has
 low-light vision.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> No form of attack deals lethal
 damage to the spellwarped woodling tarrasque. It regenerates even if it
 fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or a death 
effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect that 
would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or 
effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full 
normal hit points +10 (or 954 hp). The spellwarped woodling tarrasque is
 immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as 
mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's 
cursed wound ability. The spellwarped woodling tarrasque can be slain 
only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points
 +10 (or 954 hit points) and using a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell to keep it dead.</p>
<p align="left">If the spellwarped woodling tarrasque loses a limb or 
body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes. (The detached piece 
dies and decays normally.) The creature can reattach the severed member 
instantly by holding it to the stump.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rush (Ex):</b> Once per minute, the spellwarped woodling tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Swallow Whole (Ex):</b> The spellwarped woodling 
tarrasque can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size 
by making a successful grapple check. Once inside the tarrasque, the 
opponent takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid
 damage per round from the creature's digestive juices. A swallowed 
creature can cut its way out by dealing 50 points of damage to the 
tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular 
action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way 
out. The spellwarped woodling tarrasque's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 
Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Skills:</b> The spellwarped woodling tarrasque has a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.</p>

<p align="left">Next month, we'll take a look at golem variants and see 
what you can do when you stretch the rules a bit -- all in the name of 
fun for your players, of course. Y'all come back now, hear?</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Additional Feats</b></p>
<p align="left">The following feats are from books other than the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Enlarge Breath (from <i>Draconomicon</i>):</b> The 
length of your breath weapon increases by 50% (rounded down to the 
nearest multiple of 5). For example, an old silver dragon breathing an 
enlarged cone of cold produces a 75-foot cone instead of a 50-foot cone.
 Cone-shaped breath weapons get wider when they get longer, but 
line-shaped breath weapons do not. When you use this feat, add +1 to the
 number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Multigrab (from <i>Savage Species</i>):</b> When 
grappling an opponent with the part of your body that made the attack, 
you take only a -10 penalty on grapple checks made to maintain the hold.</p>
