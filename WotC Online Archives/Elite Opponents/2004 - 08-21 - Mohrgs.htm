<p align="left">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes. Check out this column every month for a new batch of 
formidable enemies built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="left"><b>The Mohrg: Death That Walks</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2008-21%20-%20Mohrgs_files/eo_mohrg_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="343" width="215">This
 month, our base creature is the mohrg -- a particularly vicious undead 
being. A mohrg is the animated corpse of a mass murderer or some 
similarly horrific (and unatoned) villain whose inherent evil enables it
 to continue its depredations well beyond the grave. Indeed, the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 describes it as a creature "tortured by an all-consuming hatred of 
living things," which serves as an excellent motivation for any foe of 
the PCs. Any way you look at it, the mohrg is just about as evil as evil
 gets.</p>
<p align="left">Each of the four enhanced mohrgs described in this 
article draws additional powers from a different source. Their challenge
 ratings range from 9 to 13, but if your campaign needs even tougher 
foes, increasing their Hit Dice can further augment their killing power.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Shadow Mohrg</b></p>
<p align="left">The shadow mohrg is an exceptionally stealthy undead 
denizen of the Plane of Shadow. It favors hit-and-run techniques, often 
choosing to paralyze a foe and then retreat into the shadows before 
striking again. If reduced below one-half its normal hit points, the 
shadow mohrg uses its shadow blend ability to escape into darkness, so 
that it can heal quickly and then strike again. </p>
<p align="left">Unlike most creatures, a mohrg keeps its original type 
(undead) and does not become a magical beast with the application of 
this template.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shadow Mohrg:</b> CR 9; Medium undead; HD 14d12; hp 
91; Init +8; Spd 45 ft.; AC 23, touch 14, flat-footed 19; Base Atk +7;

tongue); Full Atk +12 melee (1d6+5, slam) and +7 melee touch (paralysis,

improved grab, paralyzing touch; SQ darkvision 60 ft., evasion, fast 
healing 2, low-light vision, lucky, resistance (cold 19), shadow blend, 
undead traits; AL CE; SV Fort +6, Ref +12, Will +11; Str 21, Dex 19, Con
 --, Int 11, Wis 10, Cha 10. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Climb +13, Hide +21, Jump +11, 
Listen +11, Move Silently +27, Spot +15, Swim +9; Alertness, Dodge, 
Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Creatures killed by a shadow 
mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under its control. They do not 
possess any of the abilities they had in life.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the 
shadow mohrg must hit a Medium or smaller creature with its slam attack.
 It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</b> An opponent touched by the shadow mohrg's tongue must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b> If a shadow mohrg makes a 
successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals 
half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> The shadow mohrg regains hit 
points at the rate of 2 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit 
points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not 
allow the shadow mohrg to regrow or reattach lost body parts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lucky:</b> The shadow mohrg gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws (already figured into the statistics above).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shadow Blend (Su):</b> In any conditions other than 
daylight, a shadow mohrg can disappear into the shadows, gaining total 
concealment. Artificial illumination, even a <i>light</i> or <i>continual flame</i> spell, does not negate this ability. A <i>daylight</i> spell, however, will.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> A shadow mohrg is immune to 
mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability 
scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from 
massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it 
is willing. </p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2004%20-%2008-21%20-%20Mohrgs_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="590"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spellstitched Mohrg</b></p>
<p align="left">The spellstitched mohrg appears as a normal mohrg with 
runes carved into its skeletal form. Fortified by arcane rituals, this 
creature can bring considerable magical prowess to bear against its 
foes. Powerful necromancers often create these creatures to serve as 
elite guardians for their lairs.</p>
<p align="left">This particular spellstitched mohrg opens combat by employing one or more <i>rays of enfeeblement</i>
 (preferably from hiding) to weaken its foes. For each ray that hits, 
the target takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+5. The spellstitched
 mohrg also makes frequent use of its <i>scorching ray. </i>With each 
use of this ability, it can create three rays (each dealing 4d6 points 
of fire damage) that it can use against separate targets or a single 
foe. If possible, it uses its <i>false life</i> and <i>mage armor</i> 
abilities before combat begins. While these effects are active, it the 
following adjustments to its statistics are in effect: hp 106; AC 27, 
touch 14, flat-footed 18.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> A spellstitched mohrg is immune to
 mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Elite Fiendgrafted Mohrg</b></p>
<p align="left">Like other sentient undead, the mohrg earns a high 
degree of respect from fiends, particularly demons. Such creatures 
appreciate the evil that the mohrg spread in life, as well as its 
continuing hatred of the living. In some cases, the fiends' respect 
leads them to make physical "improvements" -- most notably fiendish 
grafts -- upon the mohrg's form.</p>
<p align="left">The following elite mohrg has received two fiendish grafts: fiendish skin and membranous wings (see <i>Fiend Folio</i> for details). The improvements granted by these grafts are included in the statistics below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elite Fiendgrafted Mohrg:</b> CR 10; Medium undead; 
HD 14d12; hp 91; Init +11; Spd 30 ft., fly 60 ft. (average); AC 27,

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</b> An opponent touched by the
 fiendgrafted mohrg's tongue must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or 
become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Sp):</b> 1/day; Fort DC 19 negates. Caster level 16th.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> A fiendgrafted mohrg is immune to 
mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Kurge: The Mohrg Assassin</b></p>
<p align="left">Few undead beings are more suited to the life of an 
assassin than mohrgs, especially since they may well have pursued such a
 profession in life. Though most mohrgs don't advance as characters, the
 rare exception can be a truly deadly enemy. </p>
<p align="left">Kurge the Executioner is such an exception. This 
literally cold-hearted killer keeps to the shadows, relying on his 
extraordinary powers of stealth to assess his targets before striking. 
Kurge is even capable of passing as a humanoid creature (thanks to his <i>disguise self</i>
 spells), though he takes a -5 penalty on Disguise checks when 
attempting to appear as a living being. (He can do only so much to 
disguise his skeletal nature, after all.) Kurge sometimes assumes the 
persona of a necromancer or a cleric of some death god, since such 
beings often appear particularly emaciated. In such cases, he brings 
along a few zombie victims to reinforce the disguise.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Kurge the Executioner:</b> Male mohrg assassin 5; CR 
13; Medium undead; HD 14d12 plus 5d6; hp 108; Init +11; Spd 30 ft.; AC 
27, touch 18, flat-footed 20; Base Atk +10; Grp +17; Atk +18 melee 
(1d6+7, slam) or +17 melee touch (paralysis, tongue); Full Atk +18 melee
 (1d6+7, slam) and +12 melee touch (paralysis, tongue) or +17 melee 
touch (paralysis, tongue); SA create spawn, death attack, improved grab,
 paralyzing touch, sneak attack +3d6; SQ darkvision 60 ft., improved 
uncanny dodge, (poison resistance +2), (poison use), uncanny dodge, 
undead traits; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref +17, Will +14; Str 24, Dex 24, Con
 --, Int 14, Wis 18, Cha 13. </p>
<p align="left"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Climb +24, Disguise +12, Hide 
+29, Listen +28, Move Silently +29, Spot +28, Swim +17; Alertness, 
Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Spring Attack,
 Weapon Focus (slam).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> Creatures killed by Kurge rise
 after 1d4 days as zombies under his control. They do not possess any of
 the abilities they had in life.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Death Attack (Ex):</b> If Kurge studies his victim 
for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that 
successfully deals damage, the sneak attack may also either paralyze or 
kill the target (Kurge's choice). The Fortitude save to survive this 
effect has a DC of 17.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, Kurge 
must hit a Medium or smaller creature with his slam attack. He can then 
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack 
of opportunity.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Paralyzing Touch (Su):</b> An opponent touched by Kurge's tongue must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4 minutes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sneak Attack (Ex):</b> Kurge deals 3d6 extra points 
of damage on any successful attack against flat-footed or flanked 
targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus 
for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against 
targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures 
without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from
 critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Kurge may choose to 
deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using a 
weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Kurge cannot be flanked and can be sneak attacked only by a character with at least 9 levels of rogue.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison Resistance:</b> As an assassin, Kurge gains a 
+2 bonus on saves against poison, but this ability is superfluous, since
 as an undead he is immune to poison.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison Use:</b> Kurge is trained in the use of poison
 and never risks accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison to a
 blade. This ability is superfluous, however, since as an undead he is 
immune to poison.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Kurge retains his Dexterity 
bonus to AC even when flat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe. (He 
still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> Kurge is immune to mind-affecting 
effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death 
effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also 
works on objects or is harmless. He is not subject to critical hits, 
nonlethal damage, ability damage to his physical ability scores, ability
 drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage.
 He cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if he is willing. </p>
