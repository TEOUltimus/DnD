<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 column aims to provide DMs with interesting opponents to pit against 
the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a simple base -- typically a
 standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i> -- each column uses the
 building blocks provided in the rulebooks to craft a variety of foes. 
Through the addition of class levels or templates, or even via simple HD
 advancement, the creatures presented in this column are transformed 
from run-of-the-mill opponents into memorable foes. Check out this 
column every month for formidable enemies built from a different 
monster!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:19px;">The Kobold: More Than It Seems</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><img src="2003%20-%2011-09%20-%20Kobolds_files/eo_kobold_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="284" width="209">This
 month, our base creature is the kobold. From the earliest days when 
brave adventurers entered dungeons in search of dragons to slay, the 
kobold has been regarded as the lowest of the low, the weakest of the 
weak, and the butt of every fantasy joke. But a closer look at these 
small reptilian humanoids reveals a different truth. Sure, they're 
physically weak, but that just means they don't make good fighters (at 
least in the traditional sense). Yes, their sensitivity to light renders
 them less capable in daylight combat, but cunning kobolds try to avoid 
such situations, thus rendering that weakness moot.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On
 the other hand, a kobold moves as fast as a Medium character, and its 
size, Dexterity, and innate natural armor grant it a higher-than-average
 AC. With a crossbow in hand, the kobold can happily ignore its Strength
 penalty while making exceptionally accurate ranged attacks. And rare is
 the kobold that simply attacks its foes outright. The ambush is its 
preferred combat tactic -- preferably one based around a nasty trap it 
has constructed for just such an occasion. With the addition of levels 
in a class that can take advantage of these benefits (such as rogue, 
ranger, or even monk), the lowly kobold suddenly becomes a very deadly 
opponent.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 three kobolds presented in this column offer three different approaches
 to creating challenging kobold opponents for your PCs. Their Challenge 
Ratings (4, 7, and 11) prove them appropriate opponents even at levels 
when most characters have long since stopped encountering kobolds. The 
challenge ratings can be adjusted up or down by adding or subtracting 
class levels, applying additional templates, and so forth.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">According to the kobold entry in the <i>Monster Manual, </i>a
 kobold with levels in an NPC class has a CR equal to its character 
level minus 3. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that a kobold with 
standard (non-NPC) class levels has a CR equal to its character level 
minus 2. However, each kobold featured in this article has above-average
 ability scores (usually the elite array given in the <i>Monster Manual</i>), and thus has a CR equal to its character level minus 1 (plus adjustment for its template, if any).</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;"><b>Hupo the Human-Slayer: Kobold Rogue</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">More
 than anything, Hupo desires respect, but he can't seem to get as much 
as he thinks he deserves. Even taking the nickname "Human-Slayer" hasn't
 done the trick. Maybe it's time to make a daring midnight raid into the
 local human village and bring back some heads or -- better yet -- some 
tasty human babies.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hupo
 makes a good foe for low-level PCs, though he poses little threat 
unless he can make optimum use of his talents for stealth. He prefers to
 snipe from the safety of darkness, firing a single shot with his 
crossbow and then retreating, only to come back later for a potentially 
deadly sneak attack. He avoids a fair fight at all costs.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b>
 If exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a 
Reflex saving throw for half damage, Hupo takes no damage with a 
successful saving throw.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</b> Hupo is dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a <i>daylight</i> spell.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Trap Sense (Ex):</b> Hupo gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +2 bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Trapfinding:</b> Hupo can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a DC higher than 20.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b>
 Hupo can react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to 
even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) 
regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible 
attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.) </span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Thanks
 to her draconic heritage, Mokodo displays little of the cowardice 
common to most other kobolds. Spawn of a union between the tribe's 
leader and a green dragon, Mokodo has excelled in both martial combat 
and sorcerous power. Having heard many tales of eldritch knights, Mokodo
 has left her tribe to pursue a similar path.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mokodo
 makes a good opponent for mid-level characters. Though typically a 
loner, she occasionally falls in with other groups of kobolds, serving 
as a potent ally or even a short-term leader. Mokodo has no fear of 
throwing herself into melee with a larger opponent, but she isn't stupid
 and avoids foolish fights. If she is losing, she doesn't hesitate to 
withdraw so that she can fight another day. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Mokodo:</b>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b>
 Once per day, Mokodo can breathe a 30-foot cone of corrosive gas. Each 
creature in the area takes 6d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 11 
half).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Familiar Benefits:</b>
 Mokodo's familiar grants her the benefits of the Alertness feat when he
 is within 5 feet of her. He also grants her the following benefits.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Empathic Link (Su):</i>
 Mokodo can communicate telepathically with her familiar at a distance 
of up to 1 mile. She has the same connection to an item or a place that 
her familiar does.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Share Spells:</i>
 Mokodo may have any spell she casts on herself also affect her familiar
 if the latter is within 5 feet at the time of casting. Mokodo may also 
cast a spell with a target of "You" on her familiar.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Touch:</i> The familiar can deliver touch spells for Mokodo.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Attach (Ex):</b>
 If Mokodo's familiar hits with a bite attack, he latches onto the 
opponent's body and automatically deals bite damage each round he 
remains attached. He loses his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and has an
 AC of 14. While attached, he can be struck with a weapon or grappled. 
To remove him through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against
 him.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Improved Evasion (Ex):</b>
 When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw 
for half damage, Mokodo's familiar takes no damage if he makes a 
successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;"><b>Lidae: Kobold Dire Wereweasel</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Perhaps
 the greatest achievement of kobold society was the semi-domestication 
of dire weasels to serve as guards for the tribe and hunters for 
warbands. The association between the two kinds of creatures lasted for 
so long that at some point, a sympathetic connection was created, 
resulting in the first kobold dire wereweasels. Even today, one kobold 
in ten thousand displays this heritage as a natural lycanthrope.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lidae
 is one of those rare creatures. Though she was once the most respected 
hunter of her tribe, a failed coup attempt against the tribe's leader 
made her an outcast. Now she hunts any prey that catches her fancy, 
though she still prefers her favored enemies -- dwarves and fey. (You 
may, of course, feel free to swap these for different favored enemies in
 your campaign.)</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Because
 of her class levels and lycanthropic abilities, Lidae makes a good 
opponent for mid- or even high-level PCs. Her death attack doesn't have a
 lot of punch, so she uses it only against foes that are likely to have 
poor Fortitude saves (such as arcane spellcasters). She prefers to 
paralyze lone opponents so that she can infect them with lycanthropy, 
seeing that as the ultimate form of tribute to her kind. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lidae
 fights best in hybrid or animal form. Her bracers, amulet, cloak, and 
gloves remain in place when she changes form, and she carries her other 
equipment on a flexible bandoleer that is specially designed to stay on 
even as her shape and size change.</span></p>

 After studying her target for 3 rounds, Lidae can either kill it or

 Lidae can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a
