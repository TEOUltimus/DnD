<p align="LEFT">Welcome to <i>Creature Incarnations,</i> a column all about monsters -- and strange, variant monsters at that! The <i><b>D&amp;D</b> Fight Club</i>
 column presents one monster at three different power levels, so that 
you can insert the appropriate version into your campaign. This column, 
on the other hand, examines different versions of a given creature for 
use in different types of campaigns. Though most versions fit best into <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns, one version in this installment is for the <b>d20 Modern</b> game, so you can use the creature in your modern-day or future campaigns too.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Design Notes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2006-30%20-%20Treants_files/ci_treant.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="296" width="300">Here
 we are again, about to embark on another strange journey to meet 
strange monsters. Those scouts I had before would really have been 
useful, but they're still under the cleric's care. I have had some 
trouble hiring new scouts, given what happened to the old ones, so we 
must wing it for this trip. I hope we can find some treants out there, 
but someone had better prep a <i>teleport</i> spell, just in case the situation gets out of hand.</p>
<p align="LEFT">To put yourself in the treant frame of mind, get out your copy of <i>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i>
 (or rent one, if you need to) and skip to the scenes with the treants. 
The movie gives an excellent visual portrayal of these creatures and can
 also show you how they behave. Then watch the rest of the movie, 
because it's really good. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The treants we find on our little woodland foray won't 
look like those in the movie, though. These are much weirder, so you'll 
have to use your imagination.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>d20 Modern: ET Treant</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Treants don't exist on Modern Earth, but they could exist on other planets. Applying the extraterrestrial template from the <i>d20 Future</i>
 supplement to a treant creates an interesting monster that can be 
placed on any planet. This one is based on cold and sonic/concussion 
abilities, but if you want a treant from a hot world, just replace 
"cold" with "heat" or "fire" as appropriate, and give its bark a reddish
 tint.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This extraterrestrial tree monster comes from a world 
much colder than Earth -- a world populated by a dominant humanoid 
species that mastered space travel many years ago. These humanoids have 
cultivated the various strange species that grow on the planet and 
spread them throughout the galaxy for various purposes. </p>
<p align="LEFT">These treants look like white oak trees that are 
perpetually covered in a layer of frost or snow. Several -- sometimes as
 many as a few hundred -- of these tree monsters are generally planted 
on a target planet at the same time and left to grow into a stable 
forest community that subsequently spreads across the world. Their 
presence invariably surprises the populace and generates chaos, 
distracting the inhabitants from the invaders' actions.</p>

 An extraterrestrial treant can animate trees within 180 feet at will, 
controlling up to two at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree
 to uproot itself. Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights
 as a treant in all respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move 
if the treant that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range.
 The ability is otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 12th). 
Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Breath Weapon (Su):</b> Once every 1d4 rounds, the 
extraterrestrial treant can breathe a 30-foot cone of cold that deals 
7d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 18 half).</p>

<p align="left"><b>Psionics (Concussion) (Sp):</b> As with the FX 
ability of the same name, the extraterrestrial treant can pummel a foe 
within 140 feet with telekinetic force, dealing 3d6 points of damage (DC
 17 Fortitude half). The extraterrestrial treant can use this power 
three times a day and does not have to track power points.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Half-Green Dragon/Half-Treant</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The description of the half-dragon template (see <i>Monster Manual,</i>
 p. 146) says, "A dragon's magical nature allows it to breed with 
virtually any creature." The half-green dragon/half-treant might be 
carrying this concept a bit far, but it's perfectly legal. If you want 
to make the creature's parentage more reasonable, you could get a 
similar result by applying the woodling template (see <i>Monster Manual III</i>) to a green dragon.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This immense fir tree has green, dragonlike wings 
sprouting from its back (that is, the opposite side from its face) and 
green scales covering its bark. Its reptilian eyes glower at the world 
from among its branches. A monstrosity in a world of the unusual, this 
creature is ostracized from all societies and therefore hates just about
 every other creature. Other treants avoid it, so it generally has no 
trouble driving away competition and establishing its own forested 
kingdom anywhere it wishes. In the <i><b>Forgotten Realms</b> Campaign Setting,</i> for example, it would fit perfectly into the Forest of Wyrms in the Western Heartlands.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Spellwarped Half-Fey/Half-Treant</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This half-fey/half-treant treant continues our "trees 
with wings" motif. Since treants are sort of feylike to begin with, it's
 easy to imagine that half-fey/half-treants exist without worrying about
 how they came to be. The half-fey template appears in the <i>Fiend Folio, </i>and the spellwarped template in <i>Monster Manual III. </i>While the latter template doesn't add much to the creature, it does bring the CR up to 10.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature has large, butterflylike wings sprouting 
from its trunk, and its branches are in bloom almost constantly. The 
half-fey/half-treant has a kind of otherworldly look about it, and its 
features seem quite delicate, even though they are composed of rough 
bark and leaves. Though not well accepted by treants, it is welcomed 
among the fey as a distant relative. Such a creature might be a chaotic 
guardian of the woodlands or the ally of a chaotic druid who is trying 
to return the world to a more natural state by closing down some 
humanoid settlements.</p>
