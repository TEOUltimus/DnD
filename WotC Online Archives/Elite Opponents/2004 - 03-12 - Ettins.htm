<p align="LEFT">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes. Check out this column every month for formidable enemies
 built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>The Ettin: Two Heads Are Better Than One</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2003-12%20-%20Ettins_files/eo_ettin_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="341" width="237">Capable
 of dealing massive amounts of damage, the ettin delivers a healthy dose
 of terror to the average adventurer. With two morningstars that can 
strike twice each for an average of 13 points per hit, the creature's 
full attack can reduce even a raging barbarian to tears. As such, ettins
 make effective encounters on their own or good minions for tougher 
giants and powerful warlords. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Still, the ettin has its weak points. As with many 
giants, its ability to threaten PCs drops off dramatically at higher 
levels. Since the ettin needs to get up close and personal to win a 
fight, high-level spellcasters and high-AC fighters can end its threat 
before it really begins. At these levels of play, the ettin's relatively
 low Will save renders it vulnerable to <i>confusion</i> spells and the like, and its AC can't stand up to a dedicated archer or fighter. </p>
<p align="LEFT">An average ettin doesn't have the ability scores to take
 up spellcasting, so its Will saves will never be terrific. But even 
though its weak points can't be completely overcome, a 
tougher-than-normal ettin can still put a serious fright into its 
opponents. Just keep in mind that its power comes in short bursts -- it 
doesn't have the staying power for a long-term fight, but if it can 
survive for even a couple rounds of melee, it's done its job. Thus, 
enhancing its short-term effectiveness is often the best bet for keeping
 it potent.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This article presents three extra-tough ettins (at CR 8, 10, and 11) that put a twist on the traditional two-headed giant.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2003-12%20-%20Ettins_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Grush: The Ettin Barbarian</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Grush is a run-of-the-mill ettin barbarian. He works 
equally well as a lone opponent (perhaps a hunter cast out from his 
colony, or the last survivor of a dwarf-giant battle) or as part of a 
group. With two mouths to utter his raging howls, he makes quite a 
racket during a fight. To stage a particularly terrifying combat, add a 
couple more just like him and watch the blood fly.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Grush:</b> Male ettin barbarian 2; CR 8; Large giant;

Space/Reach 10 ft./10 ft.; SA rage 1/day; SQ fast movement, low-light 
vision, superior two-weapon fighting, uncanny dodge; AL CE; SV Fort +12,

<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Hide -8, Listen +14, Search +1, Spot +10; Alertness, Cleave, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rage:</b> While Grush rages, his statistics change as
 follows: HD 10d8+40 plus 2d12+8; hp 106; AC 19, touch 6, flat-footed 
19; Grp +22; Atk +18 melee (2d6+9, masterwork morningstar) or +7 ranged 
(1d8+9, javelin); Full Atk +18/+13 melee (2d6+9, 2 masterwork 
morningstars) or +7 ranged (1d8+9, 2 javelins); SV Fort +14, Will +7; 
Str 28, Con 19. His fit of rage lasts for 7 rounds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex):</b> This ability negates all attack and damage penalties for fighting with two weapons.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Grush can react to danger 
before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his 
Dexterity bonus to AC regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck 
by an invisible opponent.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Possessions:</i><i>+1 breastplate,</i> two masterwork morningstars, four javelins, <i>potion of cure serious wounds,</i> 600 gp.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Broggen: The Ettin Dire Wereboar</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> Broggen was once a brawny but typically weak-willed 
example of ettinkind. As luck would have it, a pack of feral 
lycanthropic ogres chose the night that he fell asleep on guard duty to 
attack his band. But Broggen survived the assault and soon found himself
 far more powerful than he could ever have dreamed. Now he travels the 
land with a herd of boars, taking whatever he wants from the villages he
 finds.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Broggen (Giant Form):</b> Male ettin afflicted dire 
wereboar; CR 10; Large giant (shapechanger); HD 10d8+20 plus 7d10+35; hp

 Grp +23; Atk +18 melee (2d6+7, 2 morningstars); Full Atk +18/+13/+8 
melee (2d6+7, 2 morningstars) and +18 melee (2d6+6, morningstar); 
Space/Reach 10 ft./10 ft.; SQ alternate form, boar empathy, low-light 
vision, scent, superior two-weapon fighting; AL N; SV Fort +14, Ref +7,

<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Hide -8, Listen +15, Search +1,
 Spot +14; Alertness, Cleave, Endurance, Great Cleave, Improved 
Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b> Broggen can shift into dire boar form as though using the <i>polymorph</i>
 spell on himself, though his gear is not affected, he does not regain 
hit points for changing form, and only dire boar form can be assumed. He
 can also assume a bipedal humanoid form with prehensile hands and 
boarlike features. Changing to or from dire boar or hybrid form is a 
standard action. When slain, he reverts to his giant form, though he 
remains dead. Separated body parts retain their animal form, however. As
 an afflicted lycanthrope, Broggen finds this ability difficult to 
control.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Boar Empathy (Ex):</b> In any form, Broggen can 
communicate and empathize with normal or dire boars. This ability gives 
him a +4 racial bonus on checks made to influence the animal's attitude 
and allows the communication of simple concepts and (if the animal is 
friendly) commands, such as "friend," "foe," "flee," and "attack."</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Therrik: The Tauric Ettin-Elephant</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"> The tauric template in <i>Savage Species</i> does not 
allow a giant as the base humanoid because of the limited number of 
animals to which a giant could reasonably be added. The tauric 
ettin-elephant Therrik is an example of a giant-animal combination that 
works surprisingly well. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The result of bizarre arcane experimentation, Therrik 
escaped captivity many months ago and now seeks to find a place for 
himself in the world. Unlike the typical ettin, Therrik has no evil 
tendencies, though his savage behavior can easily be mistaken for 
cruelty. He's just as likely to fall in with a band of ettins or hill 
giants, or become the leader of a tribe of orcs or ogres, as he is to 
find friendship with kinder creatures.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Therrik's Challenge Rating is estimated, based on the creature's immense physical power.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Therrik:</b> Male tauric ettin-elephant; CR 11; Large
 monstrous humanoid; HD 21d8+105; hp 199; Init +4; Spd 30 ft.; AC 23,

Space/Reach 10 ft./10 ft.; SA trample 2d8+15; SQ darkvision 60 ft.,

Natural Armor (x2), Iron Will, Power Attack.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trample (Ex):</b> As a standard action during his 
turn each round, Therrik can literally run over an opponent at least one
 size category smaller than himself. The trample deals 2d8+15 points of 
bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack of 
opportunity at a -4 penalty or a DC 30 Reflex save for half damage.</p>
