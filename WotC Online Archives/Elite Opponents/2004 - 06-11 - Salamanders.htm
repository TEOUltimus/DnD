<p align="LEFT">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes. Check out this column every month for a new batch of 
formidable enemies built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>The Salamander: A Sizzling Challenge</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2006-11%20-%20Salamanders_files/eo_0611_salamander_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="235" width="287">This
 month, our base creature is the salamander. The various kinds of 
salamanders can provide excellent long-term foes for your PCs. At CR 3, 
the flamebrother works well as a low-level opponent, and even a single 
flamebrother is smart enough to lead a group of lesser minions. Later, 
average salamanders (CR 6) make challenging foes -- either alone or as 
the leaders of small groups, which often include their lesser kin. At 
higher levels, the noble salamanders (CR 10) can serve as cruel 
taskmasters, lording it over weaker salamanders or even other evil 
creatures -- preferably fire-resistant ones such as mephits, bearded 
devils, kytons, or evil azers. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Layering class levels onto a salamander is a relatively 
easy task. Lawful evil salamanders make particularly good blackguards, 
but almost any class makes a favorable addition, thanks to the 
creatures' generally high ability scores. Adding templates is a little 
trickier because so few are applicable to outsiders. The three example 
salamanders in this column present a variety of approaches, and their 
Challenge Ratings range from 6 to 13.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2006-11%20-%20Salamanders_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Coalwisp: Flamebrother Salamander Ranger</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Shunned by salamander society because he lacked the 
"killer instinct," Coalwisp was abandoned on the Material Plane at an 
early age. By hardening himself both physically and mentally, he managed
 to survive and even thrive. Now an adult, he has dedicated himself to 
hunting down others of his kind, and he seeks out any opportunity to 
destroy salamanders. Though he does not share their evil nature, he has 
managed to develop a single-minded approach to the destruction of his 
brethren that would probably impress any who witnessed it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">If your campaign features salamanders or other 
fire-based outsiders as long-term foes, Coalwisp can even be used as a 
PC. His effective character level is 10th, and his CR has been raised 
from 5 (3 for a flamebrother and 2 for his ranger levels) to 6 because 
of his elite ability scores.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Constrict (Ex):</b> Coalwisp automatically deals 1d4 points of damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage with a successful grapple check. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Heat (Ex):</b> Each of Coalwisp's natural weapons and
 metallic weapons conducts heat, dealing an additional 1d6 points of 
fire damage (included above) with each successful hit.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, Coalwisp
 must hit a creature of up to Medium size with his tail slap attack. He 
can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking 
an attack of opportunity. If he wins the grapple check, he establishes a
 hold and can constrict.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Favored Enemy:</b> Coalwisp gains a +2 bonus on his 
Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these 
skills against outsiders with the fire subtype. He gets the same bonus 
on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this type.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Outsider Traits:</b> Coalwisp cannot be raised or resurrected (though a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell can restore life).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b> Coalwisp can use body 
language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an 
animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just
 like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. His bonus 
on the check is +2. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude 
of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. Coalwisp and 
the animal must study each other for 1 minute. This ability can also be 
used to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, 
but the ranger takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Brimstone's Children: Fiendish Average Salamanders</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Brimstone, a half-fiend/half-noble salamander (see 
below) has spawned several offspring, all of which have the fiendish 
template. (This template normally can't be applied to outsiders such as 
salamanders, but these creatures are unusual exceptions because of 
Brimstone's half-fiendish nature.) Three to five of Brimstone's children
 typically accompany him at any given time, and groups of them can be 
found carrying out his dire plans virtually anywhere. Their resistance 
to cold helps offset their natural vulnerability, though powerful 
cold-based attacks still send them running. The jeweled bracer that each
 of Brimstone's children wears is similar in design to Brimstone's 
amulet.</p>
<p align="LEFT">A fiendish average salamander's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Brimstone: Half-Fiend/Half-Noble Salamander</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Brimstone's father traveled the lower planes for decades
 before returning to the Elemental Plane of Fire. During that time, the 
unholy taint of Hell took hold in the salamander's very soul, making him
 a fiend in fact as well as in outlook. When Brimstone was hatched, he 
displayed significant fiendish traits (including a pair of bat wings) 
because of his father's altered nature. Brimstone's father deemed the 
half-fiend larval salamander a gift from the gods and raised him to 
become a leader of his people.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Today, Brimstone splits his time between the Elemental 
Plane of Fire and the Nine Hells of Baator. In addition to the many 
average salamanders that serve him, he maintains a cadre of his own 
children -- all of whom are fiendish salamanders (see above) -- as a 
strike force and personal guard. Eventually, Brimstone hopes to 
establish a mighty army with which he can conquer a swath of the 
Material Plane.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Brimstone appears as a blood-red noble salamander with a
 pair of crimson bat wings streaked with black. His ruby-studded 
adamantine amulet, crafted for him by a team of azer slaves, is his most
 prized possession. Each of his fiendish salamander minions wears a 
single bracer with a similar design.</p>
