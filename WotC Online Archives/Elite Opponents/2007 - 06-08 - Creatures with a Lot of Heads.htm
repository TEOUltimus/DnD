 . More heads almost always improve a creature. Taking liberties with 
the template can also produce some really . . . er, powerful monsters. 
So, this month the <i>Creature Incarnations</i> zoo has assembled a 
collection of very strange creatures that have more than one head. Each 
uses the multiheaded template, and to make things fun each has a second 
template as well. Liven up your campaign with these weird creatures. The
 last creature is a bonus, and we have to view it magically because 
actually collecting it would be too dangerous. I don't recommend using 
it in your campaign, but it may be one of the very few Challenge Rating 
40 creatures you'll ever see, and if your group prefers to experience a 
quick and terrible death when ending a campaign (maybe they'll get a few
 lucky hits in?) . . . use this creature to wipe out your player 
characters and start a new campaign.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Chimeric Chimera </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Okay, so applying the chimeric template from <i><a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/882680000">Monster Manual II</a></i>
 to a chimera may seem odd, but it's perfectly legal. You can add a 
template more than once to the same creature as long as it continues to 
qualify. Some serious magical genetic experimentation is required, so 
this might well be a unique creature.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since the sample chimeric creature uses a magical beast 
as the base creature, the template must apply to magical beasts. 
Applying the chimeric template once to a chimera results in a creature 
with two goat heads, two dragon heads, and a lion head. Then use of the 
multiheaded template to add three dragon heads (you get to choose if the
 base creature has more than one head of different types) gives us an 
eight-headed creature with five dragon heads, two goat heads, and a lion
 head (kind of like a mutated aspect of Tiamat). The lion head is in 
charge, though the other heads offer opinions and try to assert 
authority from time to time. The dragon heads span the evil chromatic 
types for interest; if you're a purist you can give it four green heads 
and a red head.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The body looks like that of a chimera, and the creature 
fights like a chimera, but when it uses its breath weapon, all five 
dragon heads breathe at the same time.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Anarchic-Axiomatic Dark Unicorn </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature is technically illegal, unless you split 
hairs (and it probably still is). The rationale is that a two-headed 
creature has two brains and two personalities, so each head could have a
 different template applied to it. Thus, let's see what a two-headed 
unicorn with opposite alignment-based templates looks like. I am not 
sure how to breed one of these, and I don't want to know (so don't tell 
me). Maybe it is a magically fused creature, but more likely it was 
created by some deities for a specific purpose. Illegal or not, it's 
fun.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The two heads of this unicorn bicker constantly, each 
trying to assert its philosophy on whatever creatures it meets. Since 
one head cannot convince the other head to change alignments, the heads 
don't try that (though they argue about law-chaos philosophies and ways 
of doing things all the time). Its left side is the chaotic side, and 
the right side is the lawful side. Thus, it can smite chaos with the 
right horn and smite law with the left horn.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The dark template from <i>Tome of Magic</i> is required 
to change the unicorn's alignment away from good so that it can be a foe
 to your heroes. That gives it four total templates. If you want to 
dispense with the dark template, take away Hide in Plain Sight, +8 of 
its Hide skill, +6 of its Move Silently skill, 10 feet of movement (and 
+4 of its Jump skill), and reduce superior low-light vision to normal 
low-light vision.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Four-Trunked Half-Fiend Treant </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature has a couple of issues to consider. First,
 does a treant have a head? A distinctive head is required for the 
multiheaded template to be applicable. I say it does, or rather it has a
 trunk, and somewhere in the trunk it has facial features. So, if you 
treat each new head as a whole trunk, you get a tree with a lot of 
trunks (that still make only two slam attacks). Adding too many could 
create a bouquet-looking creature, but a few heads make for a cool weird
 creature. The second issue is that of half-fiend plants. They are 
allowed, but what demon is going to go around mating with plants? I am 
sure that Zuggtmoy was somehow involved.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adventurers who run into this might also be a bit 
surprised if it's also under a curse of sorts. One such situation could 
be that it grows a new trunk (head) every day. Perhaps a collector has 
it for two days or even two weeks, and during that time it grows two new
 heads. One of the sages the player characters consult suggests that it 
will continue to grow heads until it reaches some maximum (12 heads for a
 Huge creature). While nobody is sure what will happen to it after that,
 everyone's quite positive that they don't want to be around when 
whatever that is happens. This variety is not an oak-based treant, but 
some kind of birch tree, so it looks very different from what we expect 
from treants. The more heads it gains, the more chaotic it becomes, as 
well. </p>

Thereafter it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant in all 
respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that 
animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is 
otherwise similar to <i>liveoak </i> (caster level 12th). Animated trees have the same vulnerability to fire that a treant has.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Double Damage against Objects (Ex) </b> A half-fiend treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals double damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Trample (Ex) </b> Reflex DC 27 half. The save DC is Strength-based.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>The Bonus Creature: Thirty-Headed Tarrasque </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature speaks for itself. The multiheaded 
template allows it to exist, but it's still just plain wrong. The 
multiheaded template says this guy should have a CR 29, but I used the 
added Hit Dice to recalculate the CR instead. It seemed more realistic, 
and it's still a TPK machine. I thought about adding the half-fiend 
template to it, but then it becomes an instant-kill machine (as if it 
isn't already) because its <i>blasphemy</i> caster level is 106. This is
 probably the most powerful creature I can come up with, but I may 
surprise myself some day and outdo it.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In melee, it uses Power Attack for 50, leaving it +70 
melee on all its attacks. It has ninety head-based attacks in 1 round, 
thirty of which can be instant-kill attacks (since making a DC 80 Fort 
save is probably impossible to most everyone it would face).</p>
<p align="LEFT">I adjusted its spell resistance in an ad-hoc manner. One
 suggestion is to use 11 + CR as its spell resistance, but I compared 
the old spell resistance and what someone would have to roll to overcome
 it to get the new value.</p>

 To use this ability, the thirty-headed tarrasque must hit a Huge or 
smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a 
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If 
it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow 
the foe the following round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Swallow Whole (Ex) </b> The thirty-headed tarrasque 
can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of Huge or smaller size by making a
 successful grapple check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+8 points 
of crushing damage plus 2d8+6 points of acid damage per round from the 
tarrasque's digestive juices. A swallowed creature can cut its way out 
by dealing 50 points of damage to the tarrasque's digestive tract (AC 
54). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another 
swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. The tarrasque's gullet can 
hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller 
creatures.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rush (Ex) </b> Once per minute, the normally slow-moving tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Carapace (Su) </b> The thirty-headed tarrasque's 
armorlike carapace is exceptionally tough and highly reflective, 
deflecting all rays, lines, cones, and even <i>magic missile</i> spells.
 There is a 30% chance of reflecting any such effect back at the caster;
 otherwise, it is merely negated. Check for reflection before rolling to
 overcome the creature's spell resistance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Frightful Presence (Su) </b> The thirty-headed 
tarrasque can inspire terror by charging or attacking. Affected 
creatures must succeed on a DC 65 Will save or become shaken, remaining 
in that condition as long as they remain with 60 feet of the tarrasque. 
The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Regeneration (Ex) </b> No form of attack deals lethal
 damage to the thirty-headed tarrasque. The tarrasque regenerates even 
if it fails a saving throw against a <i>disintegrate </i> spell or a 
death effect. If the tarrasque fails its save against a spell or effect 
that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell 
or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full 
normal hit points +10. The tarrasque is immune to effects that produce 
incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the 
wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability. The 
tarrasque can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its
 full normal hit points +10 (or 4,957 hit points) and using a <i>wish </i> or <i>miracle </i>
 spell to keep it dead. If the tarrasque loses a limb or body part, the 
lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays 
normally). The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by 
holding it to the stump.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Additional Feats </b></p>
<p align="LEFT">These feats are not presented in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> or <i>Monster Manual</i> .</p>
<p align="left"><b>Devastating Critical (from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b>
 When using the weapon you have selected, whenever you score a critical 
hit the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character 
level + your Strength modifier) or die instantly. (Creatures immune to 
critical hits can't be affected by this feat.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Dire Charge (from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b> 
If you charge a foe during the first round of combat (or the surprise 
round, if you are allowed to act in it), you can make a full attack 
against the opponent you charge.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Elusive Target (from <i>Complete Warrior</i> ): </b> The Elusive Target feat enables the use of three tactical maneuvers.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Negate Power Attack: </i> To use this maneuver, you 
must designate a specific foe to be affected by your Dodge feat. If that
 foe uses the Power Attack feat against you, the foe gains no bonus on 
the damage roll but still takes the corresponding penalty on the attack 
roll.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Diverting Defense: </i> To use this maneuver, you 
must be flanked and you must designate one of the flanking attackers to 
be affected by your Dodge feat. The first attack of the round from the 
designated attacker automatically misses you and may strike the other 
flanking foe instead; the attacking creature makes an attack roll 
normally, and its ally is considered flat-footed. If the designated 
attacker is making a full attack against you, its second and subsequent 
attacks function normally.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Cause Overreach: </i> To use this maneuver, you must 
provoke an attack of opportunity from a foe by moving out of a 
threatened square. If the foe misses you, you can make a free trip 
attempt against this foe, and the foe does not get a chance to trip you 
if your attempt fails.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Epic Fortitude, Epic Reflexes, Epic Will </b><b>(from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b> Gain a +4 bonus to the appropriate saving throw.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Eyes in the Back of Your Head (from <i>Complete Warrior</i> ): </b>
 Attackers do not gain the usual +2 bonus on their attack rolls when 
flanking you. This feat grants no effect whenever you are attacked 
without benefit of your Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, such as when 
you are flat-footed. You may still be sneak attacked when flanked.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Great Strength (from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b> Your Strength increases by 1 point.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Hold the Line </b><b>(from <i>Complete Warrior</i> ): </b>
 You may make an attack of opportunity against a charging opponent who 
enters an area you threaten. Your attack of opportunity happens 
immediately before the charge attack is resolved.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Combat Reflexes (from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b> There is no limit to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in 1 round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Multiattack (from <i>Savage Species</i> ): </b>
 In addition to the single extra attack you get each round with each 
off-hand weapon from Multiweapon Fighting, you get a second extra attack
 with each such weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Large and In Charge (from <i>Draconomicon</i> ): </b>
 When you make a successful attack of opportunity against an opponent 
that is moving inside your threatened area, you can force the opponent 
back to the 5-foot space it was in before it provoked the attack of 
opportunity. After you hit with your attack of opportunity, make an 
opposed Strength check against your opponent. You gain a +4 bonus for 
each size category larger than your opponent you are, and an additional 
+1 bonus for every 5 points of damage you dealt with your attack of 
opportunity. If you win the opposed check, your opponent is pushed back 5
 feet into the space it just left. An opponent you push cannot move any 
farther in this round.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prone Attack (from <i>Complete Warrior</i> ): </b> 
You can make an attack from the prone position and take no penalty on 
your attack roll. If your attack roll is successful, you may regain your
 feet immediately as a free action. Opponents gain no bonus on melee 
attacks against you while you are prone.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rapid Breath (from <i>Savage Species</i> ): </b> The 
required interval between uses of your breath weapon is reduced by 1 
round. For instance, a dragon with this feat can use its breath weapon 
once every 1d4-1 rounds instead of every 1d4 rounds. If the 1d4-1 result
 is 0, the dragon can breathe again in the following round (but not 
twice in the same round). If the interval is a fixed period of time, 
such as once per hour, the interval is halved. If you have multiple 
heads with breath weapons, all your breath weapons use the new interval.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spellcasting Harrier (from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b> Any spellcaster you threaten in melee takes a penalty on Concentration checks made to cast defensively equal to 1/2 your level.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Superior Initiative (from <i>Epic Level Handbook</i> ): </b> Gain a +8 bonus to initiative that overlaps with Improved Initiative.</p>
