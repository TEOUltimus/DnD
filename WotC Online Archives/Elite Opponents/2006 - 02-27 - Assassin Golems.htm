<p align="left">Welcome to <i>Elite Opponents: Creature Incarnations, </i>a column all about monsters -- and strange, variant monsters at that!<i></i>The <b>D&amp;D</b><i>Fight Club</i>
 column presents one monster at three different power levels, so that 
you can insert the appropriate version into your campaign. This column, 
on the other hand, examines different versions of a given creature for 
use in different types of campaigns. Though most versions fit best into <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns, one version in this installment is for the <b>d20 Modern</b> game, so you can use the creature in your modern-day or future campaigns too.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Design Notes</b></p>
<p align="left">Basic golems already have statistics in the rulebooks, 
and even a specifically programmed golem is still just a golem. But in 
this installment, we examine the concept of "assassin golems" -- 
constructs that can be programmed in interesting ways and instructed to 
kill specific individuals or groups. The title of the column is a little
 misleading, since no true golems are discussed here, nor are we taking a
 single base creature and making variants of it, as we did in the last 
installment with the tarrasque. This time, we're making variations on a 
concept -- not just a creature.</p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Variant Golems</b></p>
<p align="left">If you've made any constructs in your own campaigns, 
you've probably realized that very few templates can apply to a creature
 of that type. Since they're not alive, constructs rank at the top of 
the type pyramid with undead and outsiders. Thus, to make a construct 
more challenging, you generally have to make a tougher version of the 
one in the book. However, a couple of templates can be used either to 
make another creature into a construct, or make a construct into a 
different creature -- and those are the options we're going to explore 
here. In your own game, you're free to break the rules and apply the 
templates in any way you choose, so if you want to apply the tauric or 
the spellwarped template to a stone golem, go ahead. You might come up 
with a really interesting monster.</p>

<p align="left">The yuan-ti have had centuries to adapt to the modern 
world, and most have done so. But every so often, a throwback to the 
ancient race hatches in an otherwise-normal clutch. Though such 
creatures are as smart as their more evolved cousins, they are treated 
as slaves and used to further the nefarious ends of the yuan-ti. Some 
yuan-ti like to experiment on these throwbacks, either to recover some 
lost trait and breed it back into the race, or to turn the subject into 
an even more ferocious killer.</p>
<p align="left">Since the yuan-ti described here has the head of a 
snake, he cannot disguise himself as a human. Therefore, he was deemed a
 good candidate for experimentation. His tormentors amputated his snake 
tail and attached artificial clay arms and legs, eventually turning him 
into a half-golem. During the process, he was taught to hate a 
particular race or group of people (whichever works best for your 
campaign), and parts of these creatures were fused into his clay limbs. 
This yuan-ti still has most of his memories, and he relentlessly hunts 
the creatures he was taught to hate, as instructed by his "betters" 
among the yuan-ti.</p>
<p align="left">This yuan-ti is based on the pureblood described in the <i>d20 Modern Core Rulebook,</i> with most of the characteristics of the <i>Monster Manual</i> halfblood. Then class levels were added, and finally the half-golem template from <i>Monster Manual II</i> was applied.</p>

This ability is similar to the <i>polymorph</i> spell (caster level 19th), but he does not regain any hit points for changing forms, and he can assume only viper forms. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Aversion (Sp):</b> As a standard action, the 
half-golem yuan-ti can plant a strong aversion to snakes and yuan-ti in 
the mind of a single creature (Will save DC 12 negates). An affected 
creature must take its next action to move at least 20 feet away from 
any snake or yuan-ti visible. The aversion lasts 10 minutes and can be 
overcome by succeeding on another Will save. If the averted subject 
succeeds on the second Will save, or cannot get at least 20 feet away 
from any snake or yuan-ti, it takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity as long as
 the aversion persists and it remains within 20 feet of a snake or 
yuan-ti. The half-golem yuan-ti can use this mind-affecting ability at 
will.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Berserk (Ex):</b> If the half-golem yuan-ti takes 
damage in combat, he flies into a berserk rage, attacking wildly until 
either he or his opponent is dead. He gains a +4 bonus to Strength and 
Constitution and takes a -2 penalty to Defense. The half-golem cannot 
voluntarily end his rage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Detect Poison (Sp):</b> As a standard action, the 
half-golem yuan-ti can detect whether an object, a person, or an area 
has been poisoned or is poisonous as a psionic ability. He determines 
the exact kind of poison with a successful DC 20 Wisdom check.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Haste (Su):</b> Once per day after he has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, the half-golem yuan-ti can use <i>haste</i> on himself as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Immunity to Piercing and Slashing Weapons (Ex): </b>The
 half-golem yuan-ti takes no damage from piercing or slashing weapons, 
whether they are magical or not, and no matter what material they are 
made of.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Magic Immunity (Ex):</b> The half-golem yuan-ti is 
immune to all spells, psionic powers, spell-like abilities, and 
supernatural effects. Any magical attack that deals acid damage heals 1 
point for every 3 points of damage the effect would have caused. The 
half-golem yuan-ti gets no saving throw against acid attacks.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury Fortitude DC 16; initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Produce Acid (Sp):</b> The half-golem yuan-ti has the
 power to exude acid from his body psionically as a free action, dealing
 1d6 points of damage to the next creature he touches, including a 
creature hit by his bite attack. The acid becomes inert when it leaves 
the half-golem yuan-ti's body.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Target Bonus:</b> The half-golem yuan-ti may spend an
 action point and a full-round action to designate a target. He does not
 need to know the target personally, but he must be able to describe the
 target uniquely. He cannot select a target during combat, and after 
selecting a target, he must wait 24 hours before selecting another. He 
gains the target bonus (+1 in this case) as a competence bonus on attack
 rolls against the target, as well as when he is using the following 
skills on the target or in tracking the target: Bluff, Computer Use, 
Gather Information, Investigate, Listen, Research, Search, Sense Motive,
 and Spot.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Wound (Ex): </b>The damage that the half-golem 
yuan-ti deals doesn't heal naturally and resists healing spells. A 
character attempting to cast a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature
 damaged by the half-golem yuan-ti must succeed on a DC 26 caster level 
check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character.</p>

 and managed to construct separate clockwork brains inside each of the 
ettin's two heads. As a result, the ettin retains its Superior 
Two-Weapon Fighting (normally lost when acquiring the Effigy template, 
pg. 151 of the <i>Complete Arcane</i>), and so would not take the normal penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.</td>

</tbody></table>
<p align="left">When gnomes want to kill their bigfolk enemies, they 
create horrid constructs such as this one. The effigy winged ettin is 
designed to kill creatures that move about in the open, such as hill 
giants or humans who compete for gem mines. The creature is armed with a
 lot of javelins so that it can make use of its aerial attack 
capability. Its primary downside is the loss of its superior two-weapon 
fighting ability, making it no better than any other clockwork giant in 
combat. Furthermore, it cannot learn any skills or feats, so it cannot 
be made much better than it is. </p>
<p align="left">Despite these limitations, and the fact that effigy 
winged ettins are weaker than standard golems, gnomes seem to prefer 
them. Doubtless some gnomes are working on solving the problems with 
these constructs even now.</p>
<p align="left">Effigy winged ettins look a lot like real ettins when 
their wings are folded. A successful DC 20 Spot check is required to 
tell the difference. The ones created by gnomes look particularly mean, 
but they are probably deliberately designed that way to scare opponents.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Living Golem</b></p>
<p align="left"> Sometimes wizards have peculiar ideas. (Actually, some 
would argue that their ideas are strange more often than not.) The 
wizard who created this creature ruined a perfectly good shadesteel 
golem by giving it life. The experiment did not go as the wizard 
intended, but he still managed to enslave his newly alive golem and bend
 it to his will. The wizard trained the living golem to be his personal 
killer so that he could get revenge on rival wizards.</p>
<p align="left">The creature looks human, though it stands 11 feet tall 
and is very thin and angular. Its skin is a dull gray color, it has long
 slender fingers, and its head looks like a skull. The creature wears 
dark gray clothing most of the time. Because of its very high base 
attack bonus, it uses Power Attack for 10 points every round it is in 
melee. It prefers to attack by surprise (usually from hiding) and then 
make full attacks until its foe dies.</p>
