<p align="left">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes. Check out this column every month for formidable enemies
 built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="left"><b>The Wyvern: Death on the Wing</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="2004%20-%2002-01%20-%20Wyverns_files/eo_wyvern_med_dh292.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="233" width="265">This
 month, our base creature is the wyvern -- a cousin to the dragon that 
has the savage demeanor of a simple predatory animal. Though rather 
stupid, the wyvern possesses the tremendous physical strength and 
toughness of its draconic relations.</p>
<p align="left">Wyverns typically prey on deer, goats, and other 
creatures of similar size, though some have been known to feast on 
horses or cattle as well. These dragonlike beasts have little fear of 
humanoids, though they are smart enough to learn the difference between 
armored and unarmored victims.</p>
<p align="left">Powerful warriors sometimes seek to tame wyverns as 
mounts, but such pursuits almost invariably fail because the creatures 
take poorly to training. In fact, more than one would-be wyvernrider has
 succumbed to multiple poison stings from an angry mount! Still, with 
enough protection, willpower, and magic (such as <i>charm monster</i>) available, it might be possible to pull off this feat.</p>
<p align="left">This column presents five different wyvern variants 
ranging from the skeletal wyvern at CR 3 to the great wyvern at CR 14. 
Some of these creatures share the base wyvern's simple, savage approach 
to life, while others have widely differing mindsets. These wyverns can 
be further adjusted by adding HD or templates as desired.</p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2004%20-%2002-01%20-%20Wyverns_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Skeletal Wyvern</b></p>
<p align="left">A skeletal wyvern<i></i>poses very little threat 
compared to a living one, though its poison is just as deadly to those 
who fail to resist it. The creature has none of the aggressiveness it 
possessed in life; it seeks only to obey its master's orders. Some 
necromancers use skeletal wyverns as mounts, despite their lack of 
flying ability. Others rely on the creatures as sentries, since they 
retain much of their sensory capability. Since a skeletal wyvern is 
incapable of making a flyby attack, it cannot use its talons as weapons 
and therefore cannot use its improved grab ability.</p>
<p align="left">The skeletal wyvern uses the skeletal dragon template presented in <i>Draconomicon.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Skeletal Wyvern:</b> CR 3; Large undead (augmented 
dragon); HD 7d12+7; hp 52; Init +5; Spd 20 ft.; AC 13, touch 10, 
flat-footed 12; Base Atk +7; Grp +15; Atk +10 melee (1d6+4 plus poison, 
sting) or +10 melee (2d8+4, bite); Full Atk +10 melee (1d6+4 plus 
poison, sting) and +5 melee (2d8+4, bite) and +5 melee (1d8+2, 2 wings);

 darkvision 60 ft., immunities (cold, paralysis, sleep), low-light 
vision, scent, undead traits; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref +6, Will +5; Str 19,

<p align="left"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Hide -3; Improved Initiative.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Undead Traits:</b> A skeletal dragon is immune to 
mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, 
disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save 
unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to 
critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical ability 
scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from 
massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it 
is willing. Darkvision 60 ft.</p>
<p align="left"><b><img src="2004%20-%2002-01%20-%20Wyverns_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Celestial Wyvern</b></p>
<p align="left">Many adventurers mistakenly believe the wyvern to be a 
wholly evil creature. In truth, though it is certainly savage and 
aggressive, the typical wyvern has no leaning toward evil or any other 
alignment. In fact, a small population of noble and ferocious wyverns 
exists on the upper planes -- most notably the Wilderness of the 
Beastlands. Here, on the dusky layer of Brux, flights of celestial 
wyverns soar through the skies, their sparkling scales reflecting the 
sunlight. Some spellcasters have learned to summon these creatures, and 
particularly brave heroes occasionally try to tame them for mounts.</p>
<p align="left">At the DM's option, a spellcaster can substitute celestial wyvern for avoral guardinal on the <i>summon monster VII</i>
 list. Furthermore, an 11th-level or higher paladin may be able to 
summon a celestial wyvern as a special mount (see Unusual Mounts on page
 204 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for details on such options). </p>
<p align="left">A celestial wyvern's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, a 
celestial wyvern must hit with its talons. It can then attempt to start a
 grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If
 it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and stings. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Poison (Ex):</b> Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Smite Evil (Su):</b> Once per day, a celestial wyvern can make a normal melee attack to deal 7 points of extra damage against an evil foe.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Corrupted Wyvern</b></p>
<p align="left">Twisted by malevolent forces beyond imagining, the 
corrupted wyvern is irrevocably tainted by evil. Its talons, stinger, 
and jaws are hideously oversized, its flesh is mottled and puckered, and
 its eyes are red with anger. Even more aggressive and vicious than a 
typical wyvern, the corrupted wyvern enjoys toying with prey before 
finishing it off. It often uses hit-and-run tactics over the course of 
hours or even days, gradually weakening its victim with vile wounds that
 refuse to heal.</p>
<p align="left">The corrupted creature template appears in <i>Book of Vile Darkness.</i> A corrupted wyvern's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Enhanced Power (Su):</b> The save DC for each of the corrupted wyvern's special attacks increases by +4 (already included in the values given).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> The corrupted wyvern regains

 points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not 
allow the creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.</p>

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Half-Troll/Half-Wyvern</b></p>
<p align="left">Created by a mad wizard, this horrifying crossbreed all 
but defines "that which should not exist." It has all the wyvern's 
natural ferocity, plus the troll's hardiness. The thick, knobby hide of a
 half-troll/half-wyvern has a distinct green tint, and its snout is 
somewhat elongated.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately for the world, the wizard did not stop at 
one of these abominations -- he created a breeding pair, which promptly 
broke free of their enclosure. Since that day, their spawn have spread 
throughout the land. Thankfully, half-troll/half-wyverns possess little 
of the wyvern's natural stealth, so they must rely on brute strength to 
win their battles.</p>
<p align="left">The half-troll template appears in <i>Fiend Folio.</i></p>
<p align="left"><b>Half-Troll/Half-Wyvern:</b> CR 8; Large giant

<p align="left"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> A half-troll/half-wyvern heals
 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.

<p class="size3" align="left"><b>Great Wyvern</b></p>
<p align="left">The largest wyverns grow to nearly 30 feet in length 
from nose to tail and have wingspans up to 50 feet. These terrifying 
beasts can snatch and carry off horses and cattle with ease, and 
sometimes they even prey on young copper dragons. Even adult copper 
dragons think twice about tangling with a wyvern of this size, often 
preferring to seek new territory rather than challenge such a beast.</p>
