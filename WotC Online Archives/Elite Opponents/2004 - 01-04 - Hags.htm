<p align="LEFT">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes. Check out this column every month for formidable enemies
 built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>The Hag: Bad to the Bone - and Ugly Too!</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2001-04%20-%20Hags_files/eo_hag_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="357" width="253">This
 month, our base creature is the hag. Though the typical hag is more 
than capable of going toe-to-toe with an average fighter in melee, it 
functions best if it can confuse and soften up the opposition before 
combat begins.</p>
<p align="LEFT">All three of the hags featured here have the half-elemental template (see <i>Manual of the Planes</i>),
 though each is a half-elemental of a different variety. Since all of 
them have the ability to change their appearance magically, they 
typically try to deceive their enemies by assuming false forms. The 
green hag and the sea hag can appear as humans or other Medium 
humanoids, while the annis typically takes the form of an ogre or some 
other Large creature. Disguises such as these can fool opponents into 
thinking that they face a foe much less deadly than a hag, or even that 
another spellcaster is lurking in the vicinity. Either way, the 
opponents tend to waste valuable time, which makes it much easier for 
the hag and her allies to rip them apart.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The three hags in this column are rated at CR 8, 7, and 
6. Each can be further adjusted by adding class levels, applying 
additional templates, and so forth. Furthermore, these three hags can 
join forces to form a powerful covey (see below).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2001-04%20-%20Hags_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Terraxia, Half-Earth Elemental/Half-Annis</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The largest and strongest of the hags, the annis is a 
demon in physical combat. When her natural abilities are enhanced with 
the strength of the earth, she becomes nearly unbeatable in melee.</p>
<p align="LEFT">In her normal form, Terraxia looks like an 8-foot-tall, 
elderly woman with mottled blue skin and a shock of black hair. Like 
most annis hags, she prefers to conceal her identity for as long as 
possible, so she often poses as a friendly stone giant traveler. After 
lulling her hapless victims into a false sense of security, she uses <i>fog cloud</i>
 to obscure their vision, then rips into them with her claws. Her 
Blind-Fight feat usually gives her a considerable edge in melee combat.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Terraxia: </b>Female half-earth elemental/half-annis;
 CR 8; Large outsider (earth, native); HD 7d8+28; hp 59; Init +0; Spd 50
 ft.; AC 24, touch 11, flat-footed 24; Base Atk +7; Grp +20; Atk +15

 SA improved grab, rake 1d6+9, rend 2d6+13, spell-like abilities; SQ +4 
bonus on Fort saves against poison, damage reduction 2/bludgeoning, 
darkvision 60 ft., immunities (disease, earth-based attacks), spell

<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats: </i>Bluff +8, Diplomacy +2, Hide +4, Intimidate +2, Jump +22, Listen +10, Spot +10; Alertness, Blind-Fight, Great Fortitude.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex): </b>To use this ability, Terraxia
 must hit a Large or smaller opponent with a claw attack. She can then 
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack 
of opportunity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rake (Ex):</b> Terraxia can attack a grappled foe with both claws at no penalty (+15 melee, 1d6+9).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rend (Ex): </b>If Terraxia hits with both claw 
attacks, she latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This 
attack automatically deals an extra 2d6+13 points of damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> 3/day -- <i>disguise self, fog cloud. </i>Caster level 8th. 1/day -- <i>magic stone, soften earth and stone, spike stones, stone shape. </i>Caster level 7th.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Possessions: Cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection +2,</i><i>boots of striding and springing, potion of bull's strength, potion of heroism,</i> 450 gp.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2001-04%20-%20Hags_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Vyrdahlia, Half-Fire Elemental/Half-Green Hag</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Smaller and less physically powerful than the annis, the
 green hag is nevertheless a dangerous opponent with a wide range of 
special abilities. When her natural advantages are combined with the 
destructive power of fire, she is like a force of nature fueled by sheer
 hatred.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Vyrdahlia typically poses as a female human druid, 
disguising her sickly green complexion and tangled scarlet hair with 
magic. To reinforce this image, she keeps a Large viper around -- mostly
 for show, though the animal is trained to defend her if necessary. If 
enemies are near, Vyrdahlia turns invisible to watch them. Before 
engaging opponents, she typically uses <i>ghost sound</i> and <i>dancing lights</i> to confuse them and <i>wall of fire</i> to divide them. Then she uses <i>produce flame </i>to lob fiery missiles from a safe distance. (With enough <i>dancing lights</i>
 effects around, foes aren't likely to spot the flames burning in her 
hand.) She also frequently employs hit-and-run tactics, delivering a 
Strength-damaging touch attack, then turning invisible to flee.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Vyrdahlia: </b>Female half-fire elemental/half-green 
hag; CR 7; Medium outsider (fire, native); HD 9d8+9; hp 49; Init +3; Spd
 30 ft., swim 30 ft.; AC 28, touch 13, flat-footed 25; Base Atk +9; Grp

quarterstaff); Full Atk +13 melee (1d4+4, 2 claws) or +14/+9 melee 
(1d6+6, masterwork quarterstaff); SA mimicry, spell-like abilities, 
weakness; SQ +4 bonus on Fort saves against poison, darkvision 90 ft., 
fire subtype, immunities (disease, fire), spell resistance 18; AL CE; SV
 Fort +6 (+10 against poison), Ref +9, Will +7; Str 19, Dex 16, Con 12,

Knowledge (nature) +8, Listen +14, Spot +14, Swim +12; Alertness, 
Blind-Fight, Combat Casting, Great Fortitude.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mimicry (Ex): </b>Vyrdahlia can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near her lair.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> At will -- <i>dancing lights, disguise self, ghost sound</i> (DC 13), <i>invisibility, pass without trace, tongues, water breathing;</i> 1/day -- <i>burning hands</i> (DC 14), <i>fire shield, flaming sphere </i>(DC 15), <i>produce flame, wall of fire. </i>Caster level 9th.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Weakness (Su): </b>Vyrdahlia can weaken a foe by 
making a special touch attack. The opponent must succeed on a DC 17 
Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Possessions: +1 leather armor,</i> masterwork quarterstaff<i>, minor cloak of displacement, </i>two<i> potions of cure moderate wounds,</i> 64 pp.</p>

<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Trillobia, Half-Water Elemental/Half-Sea Hag</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The sea hag is simultaneously the weakest and the 
deadliest of the hags. Though it is the least physically dangerous, its 
evil eye and horrific appearance are extraordinarily powerful weapons. </p>
<p align="LEFT">Unlike the typical sea hag, Trillobia enjoys spending 
time among humans, and she often hunts for prey in port towns and 
similar locations. She particularly enjoys posing as a lady of the 
evening so that she can lure greedy sailors to their doom. She enjoys 
allowing them to see her true form -- complete with oozing, yellow flesh
 and filthy, blue-green hair -- just before unleashing her evil eye. If 
facing a competent foe, she uses <i>obscuring mist</i> and <i>fog cloud</i> to conceal her escape.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Trillobia: </b>Female half-water elemental/half-sea 
hag; CR 6; Medium outsider (aquatic, native, water); HD 3d8+9; hp 22; 
Init +1; Spd 30 ft., swim 40 ft.; AC 16, touch 11, flat-footed 15; Base 
Atk +3; Grp +8; Atk +8 melee (1d4+5, 2 claws); Full Atk +8 melee (1d4+5,
 claw); SA evil eye, horrific appearance, spell-like abilities; SQ +4 
bonus on Fort saves against poison, amphibious, darkvision 60 ft., 
immunities (disease, water-based attacks), spell resistance 14; AL CE; 
SV Fort +3 (+7 against poison), Ref +4, Will +5; Str 21, Dex 12, Con 14,
 Int 12, Wis 15, Cha 16. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats: </i>Bluff +6, Hide +4, Knowledge (local) +4, Listen +7, Spot +7, Swim +13; Alertness, Toughness.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Evil Eye (Su): </b>Three times per day, Trillobia can
 cast her dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target 
must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be dazed for three days, although <i>remove curse </i>or <i>dispel evil</i>
 can restore sanity sooner. In addition, an affected creature must 
succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or die from fright. Creatures with 
immunity to fear effects are not affected by Trillobia's evil eye.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Horrific Appearance (Su):</b> The sight of Trillobia 
is so revolting that anyone (other than another hag) who sets eyes upon 
her must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, 
taking 2d6 points of Strength damage. This damage cannot reduce a 
victim's Strength score below 0, but anyone reduced to Strength 0 is 
helpless. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully
 save against it cannot be affected again by Trillobia's horrific 
appearance for 24 hours.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>1/day -- <i>fog cloud, obscuring mist.</i> Caster level 3rd.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Amphibious (Ex): </b>Although Trillobia is aquatic, she can survive indefinitely on land.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Possessions: Bracers of armor +1, hat of disguise, potion of barkskin</i> (+4), <i>potion of nondetection,</i> two <i>potions of magic fang,</i> two <i>elixirs of love,</i> gold necklace (600 gp), gold ring set with a tiny pearl (150 gp).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2004%20-%2001-04%20-%20Hags_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Covey of Elemental Hags</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">When gathered into a covey, the three hags detailed 
above make a formidable team. In addition to Terraxia, Vyrdahlia, and 
Trillobia, this covey includes six half-elemental ogres (two earth, two 
fire, and two water) spawned by the hags themselves. At any given time, 
three of these ogres remain in the company of the hags while the other 
three are off following their mothers' orders. While "in the field," 
these ogres carry a <i>hag eye</i> (see the <i>Monster Manual</i>) and are disguised by a <i>veil</i> spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT">While in a covey, the three hags gain the spell-like 
abilities indicated below. These abilities have been altered slightly 
from the list given for a hag covey in the <i>Monster Manual</i> because
 of the elemental nature of these hags. To use one of these abilities, 
all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must 
participate. Each ability requires a full-round action.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities: </b>3/day -- <i>animate dead, bestow curse</i> (DC 17), <i>control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana</i> (DC 18), <i>polymorph, veil</i> (DC 19), <i>vision</i>; 1/day -- <i>earthquake</i> (DC 21), <i>fire storm</i> (DC 20), <i>horrid wilting</i> (DC 21). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. </p>
<p align="LEFT">If the hags are encountered in a covey, increase the XP reward for each hag by 25% because of these extra abilities.</p>
