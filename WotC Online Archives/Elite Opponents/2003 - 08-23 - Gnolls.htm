 column aims to provide DMs with interesting opponents to pit against 
the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a simple base -- typically a
 standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i> -- each column uses the
 building blocks provided in the rulebooks to craft a variety of foes. 
Through the addition of class levels or templates, or even via simple HD
 advancement, the creatures presented in this column are transformed 
from run-of-the-mill opponents into memorable foes. Check out this 
column every month for formidable enemies built from a different 
monster!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:17px; color:#000000;"><b>The Gnoll: A Highly Versatile Foe</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This
 month, our base creature is the humble gnoll. A step up from the 
typical orc or hobgoblin, the gnoll is a formidable foe for low-level 
characters, and groups of them can challenge even characters of up to 
4th or 5th level. Because of their ferocity and toughness, evil warlords
 often use standard, 2-HD gnolls as "shock troops."</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The
 gnoll also makes a great starting point for many variations. It's such 
an easily recognized foe in its standard form that players may overlook 
the potential challenges it can present. The addition of just a few 
class levels can create a gnoll capable of giving pause to even seasoned
 adventurers. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Our first example does exactly that by adding three levels of ranger, the gnoll's favored class.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><img src="2003%20-%2008-23%20-%20Gnolls_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;"><b>Tarresh, the Gnoll Ranger</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tarresh
 is an elite hunter. His favored enemy is humankind, though you can 
easily adjust his choice to fit your campaign. (For instance, if gnolls 
are the traditional enemies of your prairie-dwelling halflings, simply 
change his favored enemy accordingly.) </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Against
 low-level characters, Tarresh can make an excellent "heavy," serving as
 either the bodyguard or the elite assassin of the characters' main 
enemy. He could also serve as the PCs' primary foe, though his low 
Intelligence and Charisma limit his effectiveness as a leader of others.
 </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tarresh
 favors hit-and-run techniques. He prefers to snipe at his quarry from a
 safe distance, though he's quite capable of going toe-to-toe with 
opponents as well. He is also an implacable pursuer who can follow his 
prey for days if necessary.</span></p>

 Tarresh has selected humans as a favored enemy. He gains a +2 bonus on

these skills against this type of creature. He gets the same bonus on 
weapon damage rolls against humans.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b>
 Tarresh can make a wild empathy check (1d20 + 3) to improve the 
attitude of an animal in the same manner that a Diplomacy check can 
change the attitude of a person. He and the animal must be able to study
 each other in order for him to use this ability.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;"><b>Fehlzahn, the Fiendish Gnoll Ranger</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As
 characters become more experienced, they learn the capabilities of 
their foes. After they've encountered a few humanoids with class levels,
 they stop being surprised when their enemies prove capable of the same 
tricks that they use. They also learn the best ways to take out such 
foes. With humanoid opponents, those ways usually involve magic -- be it
 a timely enchantment, or even just a <i>fireball</i>. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That's
 where Fehlzahn comes in handy. No ordinary gnoll, Fehlzahn is of 
fiendish heritage -- in fact, he claims to be able to trace his ancestry
 back to Yeenoghu himself. But whatever his origin, he makes a great foe
 for low- to mid-level characters. His damage reduction, resistances, 
and spell resistance are certain to give unsuspecting PCs fits, though a
 knowledgeable character might be able to guess that Fehlzahn has 
demonic blood by his coal-black eyes and scarlet-highlighted fur. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Fehlzahn
 occasionally offers his services to tribes of gnolls as a 
troubleshooter, helping them deal with particularly nettlesome foes. If 
your PCs have been giving the local humanoids some headaches, they might
 just call in Fehlzahn.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style=" font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:12px;"><b><span style=" font-size:15px; color:#CC0000;">Y'reess, the Fiendish Gnoll Vampire Ranger</span></b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Our
 last featured gnoll is Y'reess. Like Fehlzahn, he has demonic blood, 
but unlike the self-proclaimed descendant of Yeenoghu, his blood doesn't
 actually flow through his veins anymore, Y'reess has existed for 
several decades as a vampire.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once
 a member of an elite caste of demon-touched gnolls, Y'reess was an 
esteemed hunt leader among his people. Many years ago, he ran afoul of a
 powerful vampire when his pack of hunters discovered the creature's 
tomb. As a new vampire, Y'reess quickly became a favored servant of the 
creature who had initiated him into undeath, fetching whatever (or 
whoever) his master required. Then one day, while Y'reess was away, a 
group of adventurers destroyed the master vampire and his entire nest. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now
 a free-willed vampire, Y'reess enjoys taunting his victims with his 
hyenalike laugh, and he sometimes stalks his prey for many days before 
delivering the kill. He has no compunctions against preying on his own 
kind -- any allegiances he had to his fellow gnolls died when he did. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Y'reess
 can be a terrifying opponent for mid- to high-level adventurers, thanks
 to his awesome defenses and his quite competent offensive capability. 
He prefers to fight at range against tough opponents, choosing melee 
only against foes that appear to be solitary or injured. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Y'reess:</b>
 Male fiendish gnoll vampire Ranger 9; CR 14; Medium undead (augmented

Endurance, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, 
[Manyshot], Mobility, [Rapid Shot], Track, Weapon Focus (longbow).</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b>
 Y'reess can suck blood from a living victim with his fangs by making a 
successful grapple check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood, dealing 
1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On 
each such successful attack, Y'reess gains 5 temporary hit points.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Children of the Night (Su):</b>
 Y'reess commands the lesser creatures of the world. Once per day, he 
can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 
hyenas as a standard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and 
serve Y'reess for up to 1 hour.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b>
 A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by Y'reess's energy drain attack
 rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry in the <i>Monster Manual,</i>
 page 253) 1d4 days after burial. If Y'reess instead drains the victim's
 Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 
or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the
 new vampire or spawn is under the command of Y'reess and remains 
enslaved until his destruction. At any given time, Y'reess may have 
enslaved spawn totaling no more than 22 Hit Dice. Any spawn he creates 
that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or 
vampire spawn. Y'reess may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order 
to enslave a new one, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot 
be enslaved again.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Dominate (Su):</b>
 Y'reess can crush an opponent's will just by looking into his or her 
eyes. This effect is similar to a gaze attack, except that Y'reess must 
use a standard action, and those merely looking at him are not affected.
 Anyone Y'reess targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 15) or fall 
instantly under his influence as though via a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Energy Drain (Su): </b>Any
 living creature hit by Y'reess's slam attack gains two negative levels.
 For each negative level bestowed, Y'reess gains 5 temporary hit points.
 Y'reess can use his energy drain ability once per round.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Smite Good (Su):</b> Once per day, Y'reess can make a normal melee attack to deal 11 points of extra damage against a good foe.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Alternate Form (Su):</b>
 Y'reess can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, hyena, or dire hyena 
(equivalent to dire wolf) as a standard action. This ability is similar 
to a <i>polymorph</i> spell (caster level 12th), except that Y'reess 
does not regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among 
the forms mentioned here. While in his alternate form, he loses his 
natural slam attack and dominate ability, but he gains the natural 
weapons and extraordinary special attacks of his new form. He can remain
 in that form until he assumes another or until the next sunrise. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Animal Companion: </b>Y'reess may have one or more animal companions, but he has none at this time.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Combat Style:</b>
 Y'reess has selected archery as his combat style. He gains the benefits
 of the Rapid Shot feat while he wears light or no armor.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Evasion (Ex):</b>
 If exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to attempt a 
Reflex saving throw for half damage, Y'reess takes no damage with a 
successful saving throw.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b>
 Y'reess heals 5 points of damage each round so long as he has at least 1
 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, he automatically 
assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. He must reach his coffin 
home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (He can travel up to 9 
miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to him after he has been 
forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in his coffin, 
Y'reess is helpless. He regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no 
longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per 
round.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Favored Enemies:</b>
 Y'reess has selected humans and elves as his favored enemies. He gains a
 +4 bonus against humans and a +2 bonus against elves on his Bluff, 
Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills 
against these types of creatures. He gets the same bonus on weapon 
damage rolls against creatures of these types.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Gaseous Form (Su):</b>
 As a standard action, Y'reess can assume gaseous form at will as the 
spell (caster level 5th), but he can remain gaseous indefinitely and has
 a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Improved Combat Style:</b> Y'reess has selected archery as his combat style. He gains the benefits of the Manyshot feat while he wears light or no armor.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Spider Climb (Ex):</b> Y'reess can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Swift Tracker (Ex):</b>
 Y'reess can move at his normal speed while following tracks without 
taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of 
the usual -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Turn Resistance (Ex):</b> Y'reess is treated as a 15-HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Undead Traits:</b>
 Y'reess is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, 
paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that 
requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is 
harmless. He is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability 
damage to his physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, 
fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. He cannot be raised, 
and resurrection works only if he is willing.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex):</b>
 Y'reess can make a wild empathy check (1d20 + 9) to improve the 
attitude of an animal in the same manner that a Diplomacy check can 
change the attitude of a person. He and the animal must be able to study
 each other in order for him to use this ability.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Woodland Stride:</b>
 Y'reess may move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and 
similar terrain at his normal speed without suffering damage or other 
impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are 
enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Ranger Spells Prepared</b> (2/1; save DC 13 + spell level): 1st -- <i>alarm, resist energy;</i> 2nd -- <i>barkskin.</i></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style=" font-size:12px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Possessions:</i><i>+2 mithral chain shirt, +1 ring of protection, cloak of displacement</i> (minor), <i>+1 unholy composite longbow</i> (+7 Str bonus), 20 <i>+3 arrows, </i>spell component pouch.</span></p>
