<p align="LEFT">Welcome to <i>Creature Incarnations, </i>a column all about monsters -- and strange, variant monsters at that The <b>D&amp;D</b><i>Fight Club</i>
 column presents one monster at three different power levels, so that 
you can insert the appropriate version into your campaign. This column, 
on the other hand, examines different versions of a given creature for 
use in different types of campaigns. Though most versions fit best into <b>D&amp;D</b> campaigns, one version in this installment is for the <b>d20 Modern</b> game, so you can use the creature in your modern-day or future campaigns too.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Design Notes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">This month we were supposed to consider some 
lycanthropes, but my scouts have not returned yet from their mission to 
locate some. So while we wait, we'll wander into the <b>D&amp;D</b> cutting room, as it were, and pick up some discarded clips. </p>
<p align="LEFT">This installment features bizarre creatures that cannot 
be -- that is, the rules don't allow them to exist. But you might find 
them interesting or useful in your campaign, so for an April Fool's 
special (who says it has to be just one day?) we've deviated from the 
norm to explore what happens when you break the rules.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Rule-Breakers</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Because these creatures break the rules, some of them 
have apparently conflicting abilities. It's better not to worry about 
such matters because these creatures do not need to be reconciled with 
the rules. They are presented purely for your enjoyment, so just enjoy 
them!</p>
<p align="LEFT">If you actually use one of these creatures in your campaign, email me at <a href="mailto:robwiese8@yahoo.com">robwiese8@yahoo.com</a> and tell me how it worked out as a combatant. Or post your results on the message boards <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=8880912">here</a> at the Wizards of the Coast website. Now, without further ado, let's see what happens when we break some rules.</p>
<p class="size3"><b>The Demon Vampire</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2006%20-%2004-07%20-%20Creatures%20That%20Cannot%20Be_files/dx0407eo_creatureinc_vampglabrezu.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="257" width="226">Undead
 and outsiders don't normally mix -- that is, an undead template cannot 
be applied to an outsider. But since we've suspended that particular 
rule for this "what-if" installment, we can create a glabrezu vampire. 
This creature looks like a very pale version of a regular glabrezu, with
 extra-sharp fangs and slightly elongated features. The vampiric 
glabrezu is much weaker than it appears because its loss of Constitution
 has cut its hit points by more than half. Thus, it is a 
less-than-optimal combatant at EL 15 and must adopt sneakier tactics 
than its living counterpart.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This creature is presented below as both a <b>d20 Modern</b> monster and a <b>D&amp;D</b> monster, using the <b>D&amp;D</b> glabrezu from the <i>Monster Manual</i> as the base creature (adapted to fit the <b>d20 Modern</b>
 rules, where necessary) and applying the vampire template from the 
appropriate game system to it. Since the ability descriptions are quite 
similar, however, they are detailed only once.</p>

 A vampiric glabrezu can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or 
dire wolf as a standard action. While in its alternate form, the 
vampiric glabrezu loses its dominate ability, but it gains the natural 
weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain
 in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Blood Drain (Ex):</b> The vampiric glabrezu can suck 
blood from a living victim with his fangs by making a successful grapple
 check. If he pins the foe, he drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of 
Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such 
successful attack, the vampiric glabrezu gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Children of the Night (Su):</b> The vampiric glabrezu
 commands the lesser creatures of the world, and once per day he can 
call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves 
as a standard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve him
 for up to 1 hour.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Create Spawn (Su):</b> A humanoid or monstrous 
humanoid slain by a vampiric glabrezu's energy drain rises as a vampire 
spawn 1d4 days after burial. If the vampiric glabrezu instead drains the
 victim's Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if 
it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either 
case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampiric 
glabrezu that created it and remains enslaved until its master's 
destruction. At any given time, the vampiric glabrezu may have enslaved 
spawn totaling no more than 24 Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would
 exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or vampire spawn.
 A vampiric glabrezu that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of 
its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in 
this fashion. A vampiric glabrezu may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn
 in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire 
spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Damage Reduction (Su):</b> A vampiric glabrezu's natural weapons are treated as magic and evil weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Dominate (Su):</b> The vampiric glabrezu can crush an
 opponent's will just by looking onto her eyes. This is similar to a 
gaze attack, except that the vampiric glabrezu must use a standard 
action, and those merely looking at him are not affected. Anyone the 
vampiric glabrezu targets must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or fall 
instantly under his influence as though by a <i>dominate person</i> spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Energy Drain (Su):</b> A living creature hit by any 
of a vampiric glabrezu's natural attacks gains two negative levels. For 
each negative level bestowed, the vampiric glabrezu gains 5 temporary 
hit points. The vampiric glabrezu can use his energy drain ability once 
per round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fast Healing (Ex): </b>The vampiric glabrezu heals 5 
points of damage each round so long as he has at least 1 hit point. If 
reduced to 0 hit points in combat, he automatically assumes gaseous form
 and attempts to escape. He must reach his coffin home within 2 hours or
 be utterly destroyed. (He can travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Any 
additional damage dealt to a vampiric glabrezu forced into gaseous form 
has no effect. Once at rest in his coffin, a vampiric glabrezu is 
helpless. He regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer 
helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Gaseous Form (Su):</b> As a standard action, the 
vampiric glabrezu can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster 
level 5th), but he can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed 
of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Grab (Ex):</b> To use this ability, the 
vampiric glabrezu must hit a Medium or smaller opponent with a pincer 
attack. He can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Once per month, the 
vampiric glabrezu can fulfill a wish for a mortal humanoid. The demon 
can use this ability to offer a mortal whatever he desires -- but unless
 the wish is used to create pain and suffering in the world, the 
vampiric glabrezu demands either terrible evil acts or great sacrifice 
as compensation.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Spider Climb (Ex):</b> A vampiric glabrezu can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <i>spider climb</i> spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Summon Demon (Sp):</b> Once per day, the vampiric 
glabrezu can attempt to summon 4d10 dretches or 1d2 vrocks with a 50% 
chance of success, or another glabrezu with a 20% chance of success. 
This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>True Seeing (Su):</b> Vampiric glabrezu continuously use <i>true seeing</i> as the spell (caster level 14th).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Skills</b> The vampiric glabrezu has a +8 racial 
bonus on Bluff, Hide, Move Silently, Search, and Sense Motive, and a +16
 racial bonus on Listen and Spot.<br><img src="2006%20-%2004-07%20-%20Creatures%20That%20Cannot%20Be_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="300"><br> If the vampiric glabrezu assumes bat form, use the following changed statistics:<br> CE Diminutive undead (augmented outsider, chaotic, evil, extraplanar, tanar'ri)<br><b>Senses</b> Listen +41, Spot +41; darkvision 60 ft., true seeing<br><b>AC</b> 16, touch 16, flat-footed 14<br><b>Speed</b> 5 ft.

<p align="LEFT"><b>Design Notes</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The following concept came from more sinister origins. 
An early discussion raised the question, why might a warforged be paired
 with a half-golem? Perhaps the warforged-side is the healthy, sentient 
half of the creature, while the golem-side is the mechanical half with 
some mysterious agenda hardwired into it that the warforged cannot 
override... such as preexisting instructions to assassinate a given 
person or entire race. This concept would instead transform into the <a href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/eo/20060227a">Assassin Golem</a> column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="LEFT">This creature combines the half-golem template from <i>Monster Manual II</i> with the warforged from the <i><b>Eberron</b> Campaign Setting</i> (or <i>Monster Manual III</i>).
 It's illegal because the half-golem template cannot be used on a 
construct. However, the combination makes a very interesting creature. </p>
<p align="LEFT">This warforged, known as Jendrik, has a mithral body 
(courtesy of a feat) and two iron arms. Thus, he looks silvery and 
graceful except for his dull, cumbersome arms. He has miraculously made 
his two Will saving throws for the arms, so he retains his Constitution 
score and the other benefits of a living construct.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Such a creature could have been created in any of 
several ways. Perhaps some artificer was making a warforged and ran out 
of materials, so he used the iron golem arms he had lying around. Or 
maybe some wizard captured Jendrik and performed experiments on him. Or 
perhaps Jendrik lost his arms in combat in some distant place and had to
 have them replaced with the arms from an iron golem that his 
adventuring group destroyed.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Jendrik is neutral in outlook right now, but he could easily be evil or good, according to the needs of your campaign.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Rust Vulnerability (Ex):</b> Jendrik is affected by rust attacks. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Magic Immunity (Ex):</b> Jendrik is immune to any 
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, 
certain spells and effects function differently against him. A magical 
attack that deals electricity damage slows Jendrik (as the <i>slow</i> 
spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals 
fire damage breaks any slow effect on him and heals 1 point of damage 
for each 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of 
healing would cause him to exceed his full normal hit points, he gains 
any excess as temporary hit points. Jendrik gets no saving throw against
 fire effects.<br><img src="2006%20-%2004-07%20-%20Creatures%20That%20Cannot%20Be_files/grey_newline.jpg" border="0" height="7" width="300"><br> When not raging, Jendrik has the following changed statistics:<br><b>AC</b>

patches of white feathers, and his head is crowned with small horns. His
 brown skin is streaked with black, and his eyes glow red. Because he 
has trouble balancing his evil and good natures, he can behave in 
unpredictable ways. He may attack on sight, he may choose to aid a group

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Infinite Possibilities</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Scores of potentially interesting creatures cannot exist
 according to the rules, but now that we have opened that can of worms, 
we should chow down on some. Below are some more ideas for creatures 
that cannot exist, along with explanations of which rules they break. 
Many of the possibilities are not very interesting, but some can produce
 really weird creatures capable of testing your party's abilities. </p>
<p align="LEFT">You can doubtless come up with your own as well, and we invite you to do so. Create an illegal creature of your own and post it <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=8880912">here on the message boards</a> -- or, send it directly to us at <a href="mailto:dndcolumn@wizards.com">dndcolumn@wizards.com</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Half-Dragon Werewolf:</b> The half-dragon template is inherited, 
and the lycanthrope template can be acquired, so this creature might be 
possible if the lycanthrope template could be applied to dragons. But a 
dire werewolf that breathes fire is pretty scary.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Ooze Vampire:</b> The vampire template cannot be applied to 
oozes, but a gelatinous cube that bestows negative levels on a creature 
trapped inside it is just nasty. It probably couldn't drain blood, but 
still, the concept is pretty awful. A gelatinous vampire bear or 
griffon, made with the gelatinous creature template from <i>Savage Species </i>(which turns the creature into an aberration) and the vampire template from the <i>Monster Manual,</i> might also be interesting.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Half-Fey Flesh Golem:</b> The half-fey template (from <i>Fiend Folio</i>)
 cannot be applied to constructs, but if you wanted a flesh golem made 
of fey body parts that retained some fey nature due to its construction,
 one of these might just fill the bill. It would also have spell-like 
abilities, which would be a surprise for adventurers.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Tauric Mind Flayer/Howler:</b> This creature has the torso of a 
mind flayer and the body of a howler. But howlers are outsiders and mind
 flayers are aberrations, so neither is eligible for the tauric template
 (from <i>Savage Species</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT">Next month, the lycanthropes await, so bring along some wolfbane and silver weapons, and we'll see what we can see.</p>
<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Additional Feats</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The following feats are from books other than the <i>Player's Handbook</i> and the <i>Monster Manual.</i></p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Instantaneous Rage (from <i>Complete Warrior</i>): </b>Your
 rage can begin at any time you wish, even when it's nor your turn or 
when you're surprised. You can activate your rage as a free action in 
response to another's action. Thus, you can gain the benefits of rage in
 time to prevent or ameliorate an undesirable event. For example, you 
can choose to enter a rage when an enemy attacks you or casts a spell at
 you (to gain the benefits of a higher Constitution or your bonus on 
Will saves) before you know the results of the attack. You must be aware
 of the attack to respond in this way, but you maybe flat-footed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Mithral Body (for Warforged Only, from <i>Eberron Campaign Setting</i>):</b>
 Your armor bonus increases to +5, and you are considered to be wearing 
light armor. You now have a +5 maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, a -2 
penalty on all skill checks to which armor check penalties apply 
(Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of 
Hand, Swim, and Tumble), and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%.</p>
