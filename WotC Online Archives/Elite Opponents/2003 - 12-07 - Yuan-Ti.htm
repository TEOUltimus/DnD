<p align="LEFT">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Using a simple base
 -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i> -- each 
column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to craft a 
variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or templates, or 
even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in this column 
are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into memorable foes. 
Check out this column every month for a new batch of formidable enemies 
built from a different monster!</p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>Yuan-Ti: Masters of Terror</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2003%20-%2012-07%20-%20Yuan-Ti_files/oe_yuanti_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="327" width="221">Few
 creatures inspire such a visceral reaction among players and characters
 as the yuan-ti. The very epitome of corruption and evil, these 
serpentine creatures are the quintessential foes of characters who 
champion the cause of righteousness.</p>
<p align="LEFT">But if evil were the only prerequisite for a prime 
enemy, the yuan-ti would have to stand in a very long line indeed. What 
puts these ruthless snake people in a class of their own is their 
ability to pass unnoticed among humans. The fact that such dark schemers
 can walk the streets with brazen impunity adds insult to the injury of 
their evil, making them memorable foes indeed.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Monster Manual </i>v. 3.5 ratcheted the power level 
of a typical pureblood yuan-ti down a notch. That change is great news 
for DMs because it allows more room for customization of the yuan-ti, as
 well as the opportunity to introduce them into the campaign a bit 
earlier. At a challenge rating of only 3, a pureblood yuan-ti can oppose
 the party from the campaign's earliest days, and with the addition of 
class levels, templates, and other variations, it can continue to plague
 the PCs for long months or years. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The pureblood yuan-ti functions best behind the scenes, 
pulling strings and keeping a low profile. Thanks to its ability to 
disguise itself as a human, its <i>charm person</i> ability, and its 
natural stealth, even a single pureblood can give low-level characters a
 real challenge. But infinite variations are also possible depending on 
what the DM chooses to add on to the creature. With the right class 
levels or template, the cunning pureblood can become a deadly combatant 
or potent spellcaster.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The three pureblood yuan-ti in this column are rated at 
CR 6, 11, and 12. Each one can be further adjusted by adding or 
subtracting class levels, applying additional templates, and so forth. 
Since yuan-ti frequently work in groups, these foes can also be 
encountered in the company of others of their kind, functioning as 
either rank-and-file gang members or leaders of infiltration teams.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><img src="2003%20-%2012-07%20-%20Yuan-Ti_files/DnD_cb_line.jpg" border="0" height="9" width="570"></b></p>
<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Slisk, the Flesh Half-Golem Yuan-Ti</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The yuan-ti enjoy experimenting with various magical and
 biological procedures. The best known of these is the process that 
creates tainted ones and broodguards (see <i>Savage Species</i>), but 
there is almost no limit to the serpentfolk's thirst for new ways to 
corrupt and twist living creatures. At times, they even use their own 
people as test subjects.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Slisk was one of those unlucky yuan-ti selected for such
 testing. Once a valued spy, his failure on an important mission bought 
him the yuan-ti equivalent of a death sentence: a visit by the magical 
and biological engineers. In an effort to create a more durable soldier,
 the yuan-ti grafted the dead limbs of powerful humanoid beings onto 
Slisk in place of his own. Now he serves his people as a half-golem, 
neither a truly living creature nor a construct. So far, his mind has 
remained his own, but it's only a matter of time before the engineers 
decide to add another golem part and push Slisk over the edge. 
Characters who encounter Slisk both before and after this occurrence 
would have a chance to fully grasp the horror of yuan-ti 
experimentation.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Alternate Form</i> (Sp):</b> Slisk can assume the form of a Tiny to Large viper as a psionic ability. This ability is similar to a <i>polymorph</i>
 spell (caster level 19th), but he does not regain any hit points for 
changing form and he can assume only viper forms. Slisk gains the 
natural weapons of the viper form he assumes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Berserk (Ex): </b>If Slisk takes damage in combat, he
 flies into a berserk rage the following round, attacking wildly until 
either he or his opponent is dead. He gains +4 Strength, +4

state, his statistics change from the above as follows: HD 4d8+16+10; hp

cannot end his berserk state voluntarily. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Detect Poison</i> (Sp): </b>Slisk has the psionic ability to use <i>detect poison </i>as the spell (caster level 6th).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex): </b>Slisk is immune to any 
spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, 
certain spells and effects function differently against him. A magical 
attack that deals cold or fire damage slows Slisk (as the <i>slow</i> 
spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals
 electricity damage breaks any slow effect on him and heals 1 point of 
damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If 
the amount of healing would cause him to exceed his full normal hit 
points, he gains any excess as temporary hit points. Slisk gets no 
saving throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.</p>

<p class="size3red" align="LEFT"><b>Virilya, the Elite Half-Fiend/Half-Yuan-Ti Sorcerer</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Yuan-ti are creatures of corruption, so the fact that 
they frequently consort with foul creatures of the Abyss should come as 
no surprise. Fiendish yuan-ti are common, and they often occupy 
positions of great power. But half-fiend yuan-ti, marked by their god 
Merrshaulk as favored children, rank even above the fiendish versions of
 their kind.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Virilya is the daughter of a pureblood yuan-ti wizard 
and a marilith demon. Her fiendish appearance (including batlike wings) 
prevented her from working in secret among the humans in her youth, so 
she remained among her people, honing her abilities. After slaying a 
particularly irksome rival, Virilya was rewarded by her mother with a 
fiendish symbiont that serves as her familiar. Thanks to her intellect 
and personal magnetism, she has risen in power to become the chief 
advisor to a mighty yuan-ti abomination. Some, in fact, whisper that it 
is Virilya, and not her master, who truly rules the tribe.</p>

seeing the process as an opportunity to get a head start on his

 spell (caster level 19th), but Traulsk does not regain any hit points 
for changing form and he can assume only viper forms. Traulsk gains the 
natural weapons of the viper form he assumes.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Combat Style: </b>Traulsk has selected archery as his combat style. He gains the use of the Rapid Shot feat when he wears light or no armor.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><i>Detect Poison </i>(Sp): </b>Traulsk has the psionic ability to use <i>detect poison</i> as the spell (caster level 6th).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Favored Enemy:</b> Traulsk gains a +2 bonus on his 
Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these 
skills against humans. He gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls 
against creatures of this type.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fiendish Grafts: </b>Traulsk's legs are fiendish grafts (see <i>Fiend Folio,</i>
 page 209). His fast leg increases his speed by 10 feet when he is not 
wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load, and it also grants him a 
+5 competence bonus on Climb and Jump checks (already included above). 
His strong leg grants him a +2 inherent bonus to Constitution (already 
included above).</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</b> Traulsk can no 
longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of 
him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. Only a 9th-level or 
higher rogue can sneak attack him.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Poison Use: </b>Traulsk is trained in the use of poison and never risks accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison to a blade.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Uncanny Dodge (Ex): </b>Traulsk can react to danger 
before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his 
Dexterity bonus to AC even when caught flat-footed or struck by an 
invisible attacker.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex): </b>Traulsk can use body language,
 vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such 
as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a 
Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person, except that his 
bonus on the check is +4. The typical domestic animal has a starting 
attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. 
Traulsk and the animal must study each other for 1 minute. This ability 
can also be used to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score
 of 1 or 2, but Traulsk takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Possessions:</i><i>+1 chain shirt, +1 buckler, </i>masterwork scimitar, <i>+2 composite longbow</i> (+3 Str bonus), 12 arrows, 3 adamantine arrows, 3 <i>+1 unholy arrows,</i><i>gauntlets of ogre power, </i>deathblade poison (1 dose); <i>ring of protection +1, </i>52 pp.</p>
<p align="LEFT">*+1 CR included for value of fiendish grafts.</p>
