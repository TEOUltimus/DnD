<p align="LEFT">This column aims to provide DMs with interesting 
opponents to pit against the PCs in their campaigns. Building off of a 
simple base -- typically a standard monster from the <i>Monster Manual</i>
 -- each column uses the building blocks provided in the rulebooks to 
craft a variety of foes. Through the addition of class levels or 
templates, or even via simple HD advancement, the creatures presented in
 this column are transformed from run-of-the-mill opponents into 
memorable foes.</p>
<p class="size4red" align="LEFT"><b>The Flesh Golem: An Undead That's Not Undead</b></p>
<p align="LEFT"><img src="2004%20-%2009-04%20-%20Flesh%20Golems_files/eo_fleshgolem_med.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="381" width="179">In our final installment of <i>Elite Opponents,</i>
 we present the flesh golem -- an amalgamation of physical remains 
stitched together and animated through an arcane ritual. Though the 
flesh golem lacks the innate evil nature of an undead creature, it 
remains just as grotesque as any zombie.</p>
<p align="LEFT">This article offers four different versions of the flesh
 golem, each of which draws new and exciting powers from a different 
source. The challenge ratings for these enhanced flesh golems range from
 5 to 11. Adding extra Hit Dice, templates, or class levels can further 
augment each golem's ability to challenge your PCs.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fedder the Incarnate Flesh Golem</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">The incarnate golem (created with the incarnate construct template from <i>Savage Species</i>)
 is unsuited for social interaction. Though it gains sentience from the 
animation process, its ability to deal with others is severely hampered 
by both its physical appearance and its extremely weak personality. Most
 incarnate golems choose to live apart from society rather than face the
 constant reminders that they don't fit in. Some, however, find special 
niches in the world, often as mercenaries or adventurers.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The incarnate flesh golem known as Fedder puts his 
formidable strength to work for those who pay for his efforts. He often 
works as a bodyguard or enforcer, but sometimes he augments his earnings
 with income from adventuring.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Fedder may be used as a player character if desired. His effective character level is 8th.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Flesh Half-Golem/Half-Troll</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Using foul arcane rituals, an unknown wizard once 
managed to override a troll's natural regenerative powers long enough to
 attach a dead limb to its body, thus converting it into a flesh 
half-golem (see the half-golem template in <i>Monster Manual II</i>). 
Perhaps thankfully, the wizard was slain by adventurers before he could 
continue his studies, but his horrible creation now wanders the 
countryside, confused by its bizarre existence.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Since this flesh half-golem has not yet failed a Will save for limb attachment, it has not become a full-fledged construct.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Flesh Half-Golem/Half-Troll:</b> CR 8; Large giant; 
HD 6d8+48+15; hp 90; Init +1; Spd 30 ft. (can't run); AC 15, touch 10,

Atk +12 melee (1d6+9, 2 claws) and +7 melee (1d6+4, bite); Space/Reach 
10 ft./10 ft.; SA berserk, rend 2d6+9; SQ damage reduction 5/adamantine,
 darkvision 90 ft., immunity to magic, low-light vision, regeneration 5,
 scent; AL CE; SV Fort +15, Ref +3, Will +3; Str 29, Dex 12, Con 27, Int
 1, Wis 9, Cha 1. </p>
<p align="LEFT"><i>Skills and Feats:</i> Hide -3, Listen +5, Spot +6; Alertness, Iron Will, Track.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Berserk (Ex):</b> When the flesh 
half-golem/half-troll enters combat, its elemental spirit has a 
cumulative 1% chance each round to break free, causing it to go berserk.
 The uncontrolled half-golem/half-troll goes on a rampage, attacking the
 nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if 
no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. 
Its creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking 
firmly and persuasively to it (DC 19 Charisma check to succeed). It 
takes 1 minute of inactivity by the flesh half-golem/half-troll to reset
 its berserk chance to 0%.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Rend (Ex):</b> If the flesh half-golem/half-troll 
hits with both claws, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the 
flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of 
damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> A flesh 
half-golem/half-troll is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that 
allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects 
function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical 
attack that deals cold or fire damage slows it (as the <i>slow</i> 
spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals
 electricity damage breaks any slow effect on the flesh 
half-golem/half-troll and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of 
damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause it 
to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary 
hit points. A flesh half-golem/half-troll gets no saving throw against 
attacks that deal electricity damage.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Regeneration (Ex):</b> Fire and acid deal normal 
damage to the flesh half-golem/half-troll. If it loses a limb or body 
part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. It can reattach the 
severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.</p>

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Corrupted Flesh Golem</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Though they are usually neutral, golems that spend too 
much time guarding places of powerful evil can become twisted and 
malevolent. When a flesh golem is corrupted in such a manner, its form 
becomes even more misshapen and discolored than normal, sporting 
hideously bulging muscles under a hardened skin. This creature was 
created with the corrupted template from the <i>Book of Vile Darkness.</i></p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Berserk (Ex):</b> When a corrupted flesh golem enters
 combat, its elemental spirit has a cumulative 1% chance each round to 
break free, causing it to go berserk. The uncontrolled corrupted golem 
goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing 
some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then 
moving on to spread more destruction. The corrupted flesh golem's 
creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly
 and persuasively to the corrupted golem (DC 19 Charisma check to 
succeed). It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the corrupted golem to 
reset its berserk chance to 0%.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Disruptive Attack (Su):</b> The corrupted flesh golem deals 4 points of vile damage (see the <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i>) when it touches uncorrupted, living, corporeal nonoutsiders.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Fast Healing (Ex):</b> The corrupted flesh golem 
regains hit points at the rate of 4 per round. Fast healing does not 
restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it 
does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b>Immunity to Magic (Ex):</b> A corrupted flesh golem 
is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell 
resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
 against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals cold 
or fire damage slows a corrupted flesh golem (as the <i>slow</i> spell)

<p class="size3" align="LEFT"><b>Advanced Flesh Golem</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">Flesh golems constructed from the body parts of giants 
are even more massive and terrifying than the normal versions. Giant 
flesh golems tower over their enemies, using their titanic might to 
pound intruders into jelly. The Huge flesh golem presented here is the 
largest version that can be created, and it makes a formidable guardian 
indeed.</p>

<p align="LEFT"><b>Construct Traits:</b> A Huge flesh golem has immunity
 to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, 
necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, 
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a
 Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is 
not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability 
drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage but 
can be repaired. </p>
