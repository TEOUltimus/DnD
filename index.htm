<h3>Class Features</h3>
<p>
All of the following are class features of the monk.
</p>

<h5>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h5>
<p>
	Monks are <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency">proficient</a> with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#javelin">javelin</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#kama">kama</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#kukri">kukri</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#nunchaku">nunchaku</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#quarterstaff">quarterstaff</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#sai">sai</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#tableWeapons">short sword</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#shortbow">shortbow</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#shortspear">shortspear</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#shuriken">shuriken</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#siangham">siangham</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#sling">sling</a>, and <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#spear">spear</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Monks are <em>not</em> proficient with any armor or shields
</p>
<p>
	When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and any flailing or decisive strike class features.
</p>

<h5 id="aCBonus">AC Bonus (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).
</p>
<p>
	These bonuses to AC apply even against <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#touchAttacks">touch attacks</a> or when the monk is <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted">flat-footed</a>. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#helpless">helpless</a>, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

<h5 id="unarmedStrike">Unarmed Strike</h5>
<p>
	At 1st level, a monk gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedUnarmedStrike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a> as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#unarmedStrike">unarmed strikes</a> with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes and natural attacks.
</p>
<p>
	Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/injuryandDeath.htm#nonlethalDamage">nonlethal damage</a> instead with no penalty on her <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a>. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#grappling">grappling</a>.
</p>
<p>
	A monk’s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#naturalWeapons">natural weapon</a> for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#manufacturedWeapons">manufactured weapons</a> or natural weapons.
</p>
<p>
	A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on <a href="#tableTheMonk">Table: The Monk</a>. The unarmed damage on <a href="#tableTheMonk">Table: The Monk</a> is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see <a href="#tableSmallorLargeMonkUnarmedDamage">Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage</a>.
</p>

<h5 id="monkEvasion">Evasion (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex">Reflex saving throw</a> against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#helpless">helpless</a> monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.
</p>

<h5 id="monkFastMovement">Fast Movement (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 3rd level, a monk gains an <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#enhancementBonus">enhancement bonus</a> to her speed, as shown on <a href="#tableTheMonk">Table: The Monk</a>. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
</p>

<h5 id="uncannyDodge">Uncanny Dodge (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 3rd level, a monk retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted">flat-footed</a> or struck by an <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#invisible">invisible</a> attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a monk already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#improvedUncannyDodge">improved uncanny dodge</a> instead.
</p>

<h5 id="kiStrike">Ki Strike (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 4th level, a monk’s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed strikes and natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a>. Ki strike improves with the character’s monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed strikes and natural weapons are also treated as aligned weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed strikes and natural weapons are also treated as <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialMaterials.htm#adamantine">adamantine</a> weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/exploration.htm#hardness">hardness</a>.
</p>

<h5 id="featherFall">Feather Fall (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">Sp</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 8th level or higher, a monk can choose to slow her descent when falling. This effect is as the spell <em><a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/featherFall.htm">feather fall</a> (self only)</em> and is usable at will.
</p>

<h5 id="diamondBody">Mettle (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 9th level and higher, a monk can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower or fortitude. If she makes a successful <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#will">Will</a> or <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#fortitude">Fortitude</a> save against an attack that normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), she instead completely negates the effect. An unconscious or sleeping monk does not gain the benefit of mettle. 
</p>

<h5 id="monkImprovedEvasion">Improved Evasion (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 11th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex">Reflex saving throw</a> against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#helpless">helpless</a> monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
</p>

<h5 id="abundantStep">Abundant Step (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dimensionDoor.htm">dimension door</a>, once per day per 2 monk levels. Her caster level for this effect is her monk level. Using this ability is a move action.
</p>

<h5 id="diamondSoul">Improved Mettle (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 15th level, a monk’s mettle ability improves. She still negates the effect on a successful <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#will">Will</a> or <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#fortitude">Fortitude</a> save, but henceforth she only suffers the lesser effect on a failed save. An unconscious or sleeping monk does not gain the benefit of improved mettle.
</p>

<h5 id="tongueoftheSunandMoon">Tongue of the Sun and Moon (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.
</p>

<h5 id="emptyBody">Empty Body (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#etherealness">ethereal</a> state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell <a class="spell" href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/etherealness.htm">etherealness</a>. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
</p>

<h5 id="monkTimelessBody">Timeless Body (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	Upon attaining 19th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.
</p>

<h4 id="shadowMonkClassFeatures">Shadow Monk Class Features</h4>
<p>
	The shadow monk has all the monk class features, except as noted below.
</p>

<h5 id="shadowMonkBonusFeat">Bonus Feat</h5>
<p>
	At 1st level, a shadow monk may select either <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#combatExpertise">Combat Expertise</a> or <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#stunningFist">Stunning Fist</a> as a bonus feat.<br/>
	At 2nd level, she may select either <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#combatReflexes">Combat Reflexes</a> or <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#weaponFinesse">Weapon Finesse</a> as a bonus feat.<br/>
	At 6th level, she may select either <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedInitiative">Improved Initiative</a> or <a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/champions-of-valor--28/carmendine-monk--292/index.html">Carmendine Monk</a> as a bonus feat. Carmendine Monk also applies to the DC of your Feign Death and Fangs' Death abilities, replacing Con with Int for the DCs of those abilities.<br/>
	At 10th level, she may select either <a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/champions-of-ruin--27/craven--484/index.html">Craven</a> or <a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/lords-of-madness--72/darkstalker--512/index.html">Darkstalker</a> as a bonus feat.<br/>
	At 14th level, she may select either <a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-adventurer--54/staggering-strike--2753/index.html">Staggering Strike</a> or <a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-arcane--55/pierce-magical-concealment--2158/index.html">Pierce Magical Concealment</a> as a bonus feat.<br/>
	At 18th level, she receives <a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/draconomicon--92/improved-rapidstrike--3228/index.html">Improved Rapidstrike</a> (Bite) as a bonus feat even though Improved Rapidstrike could not normally be applied to a bite attack.<br/>
	A shadow monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.
</p>

<h5 id="feignDeath">Feign Death (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	Beginning at 2nd level as an immediate action, the shadow monk can enter a catatonic state in which she appears to be dead. While feigning death, she cannot see or feel anything, but retains the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around her.

	While under the effect of this ability, she immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate her, such as raise dead or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and true resurrection immediately end the feign death ability.

	Spells and other effects that assess her current condition, such as <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/status.htm">status</a> and <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/deathwatch.htm">deathwatch</a>, indicate that she is dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 monk level + your Con modifier) can discern that she is actually alive.

	She can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though still requires food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.
</p>

<h5 id="darkvision">Darkvision (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 3rd level, a shadow monk gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. This replaces uncanny dodge.
</p>

<h5 id="sneakAttack">Sneak Attack</h5>
<p>
	At 3rd level the shadow monk gains the ability to <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/rogue.htm#sneakAttack">sneak attack</a>, as the rogue ability. Her bonus damage increases every three levels thereafter (+2d6 at 6th, +3d6 at 9th, and so on).
</p>

<h5 id="fangs">Fangs (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	A 4th-level shadow monk can grow fangs and gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage (1d3 for Small monks). She can grow and dismiss her fangs as a swift action at will. This attack is made at her highest attack bonus. If made as part of a full attack, the bite attack suffers a -2 penalty (as though the monk had the <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsterFeats.htm#multiattack">Multiattack</a> feat).<br/><br/>

	At 13th level the shadow monk may, once per day when she deals damage with a bite, use her bite attack to instantly slay a living creature. The target of this attack must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + &frac12; the monk’s level + Constitution modifier) or die. This is a poison attack.
</p>

<h5 id="invisibleFist">Invisible Fist (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	Beginning at 5th level, as an immediate action, a shadow monk can become invisible until the end of her turn, as the <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/invisibilityGreater.htm">greater invisibility</a> spell.<br/><br/>

	At 11th level, as an immediate action, she can use <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/blink.htm">blink</a>, as the spell, for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round).<br/><br/>

	A shadow monk can use these abilities a combined number of times per day equal to 3 + her Wisdom modifier.
</p>

<h5 id="shadowBlend">Shadow Blend (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	In any conditions other than full daylight, a 7th-level shadow monk disappears into the shadows, gaining total concealment. Artificial light does not negate this ability, though a daylight spell does.
</p>

<h5 id="suggestion">Suggestion (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">Sp</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 17th level or higher, a shadow monk can make a <em><a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/suggestion.htm">suggestion</a></em> to another creature. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + &frac12; the monk’s level + Wisdom modifier) to resist this effect.  Her caster level for this effect is her monk level. This ability is usable at will.
</p>

<h5 id="shadowSelf">Shadow Self</h5>
<p>
	At 20th level, a shadow monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#outsiderType">outsider</a> rather than as a <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#humanoidType">humanoid</a> (or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. She also benefits from a continuous <em><a href="https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/spell-compendium--86/superior-invisibility--3920/index.html">superior invisibility</a></em> effect in any conditions other than full daylight. If this ability is dismissed or dispelled she can resume it as a swift action.<br/><br/>

	Additionally, the monk gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a> 10/good, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-good weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.
</p>

<h4 id="shaolinMonkClassFeatures">Shaolin Monk Class Features</h4>
<p>
	The shaolin monk has all the monk class features, except as noted below.
</p>

<h5 id="shaolinMonkBonusFeat">Bonus Feat</h5>
<p>
	At 1st level, a shaolin monk gets a bonus combat-oriented feat. She gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every four monk levels thereafter (6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats, monk bonus feats, or ranger bonus feats. A shaolin monk must still possess any feats prerequisite for each bonus feat, but need not have any of the other prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.
</p>

<h5 id="decisiveStrike">Decisive Strike (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	As a full-round action, make one attack using your highest base attack bonus but taking a -2 penalty on this attack roll. If the attack hits, it deals double damage (as does any other attack you make before the start of your next turn). If you use this strike to deliver a stunning attack, increase the save DC to resist the stun by 2.<br/><br/>

	At 5th level, the penalty on the attack roll lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears.<br/><br/>

	At 11th level, you can make two attacks when using this class feature. Both attacks use your highest base attack bonus.<br/><br/>

	At 14th level, when using this ability, any time before the start of your next turn you can use an immediate action to make a melee attack (using your highest base attack bonus) against an enemy that attacks you in melee.<br/><br/>

	A shaolin monk with the stunning fist feat can expend one attempt to replace a single attack as part of a full attack action with a single decisive strike. The strike uses the same base attack bonus as the replaced attack. The other attacks made during that action do not have their damage doubled.
</p>

<h5 id="purityofBody">Purity of Body (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 5th level, a shaolin monk gains immunity to all <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#disease">diseases</a> except for supernatural and magical diseases.
</p>

<h5 id="wholenessofBody">Fast Healing (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 7th level or higher, a shaolin monk can heal her own wounds. She gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fastHealing">fast healing</a> 1, or her existing fast healing increases by 1. This does not stack with fast healing granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects. Her fast healing improves to 3 at 12th level, 5 at 17th level, and 10 at 20th level.
</p>

<h5 id="quiveringPalm">Quivering Palm (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	Starting at 13th level, a shaolin monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and she must announce her intent before making her <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a>. <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#constructType">Constructs</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#oozeType">oozes</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#plantType">plants</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#undeadType">undead</a>, <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#incorporealSubtype">incorporeal creatures</a>, and creatures immune to <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#criticalHits">critical hits</a> cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions">free action</a>), and unless the target makes a <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#fortitude">Fortitude saving throw</a> (DC 10 + &frac12; the monk’s level + the monk’s Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.

<p>
	At 20th level, a shaolin monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#outsiderType">outsider</a> rather than as a <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#humanoidType">humanoid</a> (or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, she gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a> 10/chaotic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-chaotic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the shaolin monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.

<h4 id="shonenMonkClassFeatures">Shōnen Monk Class Features</h4>
<p>
	The shōnen monk has all the monk class features, except as noted below.
</p>

	At 2nd level, she receives <a href="https://dndtools.org/feats/players-handbook-ii--80/kiblast--1712/">Ki Blast</a> as a bonus feat. When she uses a move action to activate the feat, she can create the orb as a free action as many times as she wants for one minute. Attacking with it can be done in place of a normal attack (including as part of a full attack).<br/>
	At 6th level, she receives <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsterFeats.htm#flybyAttack">Flyby Attack</a> as a bonus feat.<br/>

</p>

<h5 id="flight">Flight (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 5th level, a shōnen monk can focus her Ki to take flight. As long as she has at least one use of her stunning fist feat remaining, she can fly for a number of rounds per day equal to her monk level. She flies at a speed equal to the speed bonus she received from her <a href="#monkFastMovement">Fast Movement</a> (average maneuverability).<br/><br/>

	At 8th level, she has enough stamina and prowess to fly for longer periods. Her flight speed improves to her base land speed (good maneuverability), and the number of rounds she can fly is no longer limited by her level. She must still have at least one use of her stunning fist feat remaining in order to fly.<br/><br/>

	This replaces feather fall.
</p>

<h5 id="locateCreature">Locate Creature (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">Sp</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 7th level or higher, a shōnen monk can sense conscious, living creatures as the spell <em><a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/locateCreature.htm">locate creature</a></em>. Her caster level for this effect is her monk level. This ability does not work on constructs or undead, and is usable at will.
</p>

<h5 id="bloodWind">Blood Wind (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">Sp</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 9th level or higher, a shōnen monk can project her attacks as the spell <em><a href="http://dndtools.org/spells/spell-compendium--86/blood-wind--3975/">blood wind</a></em> (self only), usable at will. Her caster level for this effect is her monk level.
</p>

<h5 id="shonenKiStrike">Ki Strike (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 10th level, a shōnen monk’s unarmed strikes and natural weapons are able to overcome <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a> that cannot normally be negated (DR/—). This is instead of the aligned ki strike monks normally receive at level 10. A shōnen monk’s ki strike ability is in all other ways identical to the normal <a href="#kiStrike">Ki strike</a> ability.
</p>

<h5 id="teleport">Teleport (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">Sp</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 13th level or higher, a shōnen monk can teleport <em><a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleport.htm">teleport</a></em> (self and up to one other creature) once per day. The target creature can be unwilling but may make a Will save (DC 10 + &frac12; the monk’s level + Wisdom modifier) to resist this effect. Her caster level for this effect is her monk level.<br/><br/>

	At 17th level, a shōnen monk can teleport at will. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.
</p>

<h5 id="energyWave">Energy Wave (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/monsters/overview.htm#psiLikeAbilities">Psi</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 14th level or higher, a shōnen monk can expend a stunning fist attemp to manifest <em><a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/energyWave.htm">energy wave</a></em> as a Psi-like Ability. The save DC to resist this effect is Wisdom based. Treat the shōnen monk's manifester level as her monk level.
</p>

<h5 id="tornadoBlast">Tornado Blast (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/monsters/overview.htm#psiLikeAbilities">Psi</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 19th level or higher, a shōnen monk can expend a stunning fist attemp to manifest <em><a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/tornadoBlast.htm">tornado blast</a></em> as a Psi-like Ability. The save DC to resist this effect is Wisdom based. Treat the shōnen monk's manifester level as her monk level.
	This replaces empty body.
</p>

<h5 id="dragonBody">Dragon Body</h5>
<p>
	At 20th level, a shōnen monk becomes an ascended being. Her type is forevermore changed to <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#dragonType">dragon</a> (rather than <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#humanoidType">humanoid</a> or whatever the monk’s creature type was). She also gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#blindsightAndBlindsense">blindsight</a> with a range of 60 feet and becomes immune to fire. Additionally, the monk gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a> 10/epic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-epic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar damage reduction.
</p>

<h4 id="wildMonkClassFeatures">Wild Monk Class Features</h4>
<p>
	The wild monk has all the monk class features, except as noted below.
</p>

<h5 id="flurryofBlows">Flailing Strike (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	Wild monks practice martial arts with a reckless abandon that shifts drastically from humorously ineffective to frighteningly deadly. At the expense of accuracy, an unarmored wild monk can make a roll (of the die type shown on the <a href="#tableVariantMonkClassFeatures">wild monk chart</a>) to determine how many extra attacks she can make (minimum 0). Regardless of the number of attacks made, she suffers an attack penalty on all of them. At 1st level she takes a -2 penalty, at 5th level it decreases to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. Using a flailing strike requires a full-round action and can only be made with unarmed strikes or natural weapons. This replaces the bonus feats a Monk would normally gain.
</p>

<h5 id="erraticAdvance">Erratic Advance (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities">Ex</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 5th level, a wild monk can attempt to daze an opponent with a wild and erratic rush. As part of a charge, a wild monk can activate this ability, forcing her opponent to make a Will save (DC 10 + &frac12; the monk’s level + Wisdom modifier) or become dazed for 1 round.
</p>

<h5 id="wildShape">Wild Shape (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	At 6th level, the wild monk gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. This ability works exactly as the <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#wildShape">druid ability</a> of the same name. The wild monk can use this ability more times per day at 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th level, as noted on the wild monk advancement table. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 12th level, a Tiny animal at 13th level, and a Huge animal at 16th level. This replaces abundant step.<br/><br/>

	At 13th level, the wild monk becomes able to use wild shape to change into an elemental of any size she could normally take the shape of once per day. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 19th level.<br/><br/>

	If a wild monk also has levels in wild ranger or druid, add the levels of all those classes together. Use the most favorable result to determine wild shape forms available and uses per day. Thus, an 6th-level druid/6th-level wild monk could wild shape four times per day and take the form of any Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large animal or plant.
</p>

<h5 id="displacingStance">Displacing Stance (<a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities">Su</a>)</h5>
<p>
	Beginning at 7th level, the wild monk's movements become so wild and unpredictable that she can partially displace herself for a number of rounds per day equal to half her chaos monk class level (these rounds need not be consecutive). This grants her a 20% chance that an attacker misses because of the displacing stance. At 12th level the miss chance increases to 50%. This stance can be entered as an immediate action. This replaces feather fall.
</p>

<h5 id="anarchicSelf">Anarchic Self</h5>
<p>
	At 20th level, a wild monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#outsiderType">outsider</a> rather than as a <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#humanoidType">humanoid</a> (or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. She also gains the shapechanger subtype and becomes immune to any transmutation effect unless she is willing to accept it. Additionally, the monk gains <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">damage reduction</a> 10/lawful, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-lawful weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn’t have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.
</p>

<h3 id="exMonks">Ex-Monks</h3>
<p>
	A monk whose alignment changes to an unpermitted alignment cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.
</p>
<p>
	Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.
